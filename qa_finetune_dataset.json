Certainly, the design and performance of\nindividual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and\nturbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career. It is,\nhowever, the overall performance of the gas turbine that the customer actually\npurchases. The optimisation process involves many uncertainties and a proper\nunderstanding of these, together with the established facts and the method of\nhandling this information, is required to permit manufacturers to develop their\nengines successfully and allow operators to operate the machines to their best\nadvantage. This is particularly true in the de-regulated market in which many\noperate today and which others will be joining in the near future.\nAlthough there are many very remarkable books on industrial gas turbine\nperformance and engineering, this book offers something different through\na combined approach to the theory of gas turbines, their performance, and\nthe use of gas turbine simulators. Simulators form an analysis method which\ncan be used to bring together the many disciplines involved and which\nprovides a way of assessing the impact of uncertainties. The combination of\nthe book with the example simulators provides an added dimension to the\nproduct and this seems to conform to what many educational and training\nexperts in this field have been demanding for some time. The book/simulator\ncombination provides a useful reference text for students and practising\nengineers in both gas turbine manufacturing and operations.\nThe book initially covers the theory of gas turbine performance from a\ndesign and off-design point of view, including transient analysis, and gives\nmuch detail on these two very important aspects of engine performance. The\nlatter part of the book revisits the earlier chapters, using the simulators to\nhighlight in detail the issues facing industrial gas turbines in the real world.\nThe simulators are effectively virtual engines with respect to performance,\ndeterioration, emissions, control, and life usage. There is also a useful life\ncycle calculation module. This provides a clear view of the operability of the\ngas turbine under different conditions.\nxiii",

These exercises are\nnot restrictively academic but include much of the author\u2019s experience, gained\nfrom an operator \u2019s viewpoint.

        "fb638090-6e12-4c58-ae0e-2fc12b8fe5cb": "Preface\nThe use of industrial gas turbines is widespread in many industries that require\npower. The power is used to generate electricity or drive equipment such as\npumps and process compressors. Gas turbines are also used extensively in\nnaval propulsion and in this case are often referred to as naval gas turbines. In\nany of these applications, the performance of the gas turbines is the end product\nthat strongly influences the profitability of the business that employs them.\nIndustrial gas turbines often have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions\nthat do not correspond to their design conditions. Therefore, understanding the\nperformance of gas turbines at such operating conditions is particularly\nimportant, especially in a deregulated market.\nOther factors in addition to the performance of gas turbines affect their\noperability. These factors include emissions, deterioration, life usage and\ncontrols. For example, legislation may result in emissions being too high and\nthe means to control them could affect the engine performance and thus revenue.\nGas turbine performance deterioration is inevitable. This could be due to\ncompressor fouling, which can be easily rectified by compressor washing, or\nto more serious damage to compressors or turbines. Therefore, an understanding\nof performance deterioration is now paramount. Various engine operating limits\nare imposed by manufacturers and correspond to the exhaust gas turbine limit,\nspeed and power. These are necessary to achieve suitable engine life, namely\nturbine creep life. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to ensure\nthat such operating limits are not exceeded. Furthermore, it is also the job of\nthe control system to ensure that any engine load changes occur safely.\nImproving the understanding of the above issues has provided the impetus\nto write this book. The book begins with a brief revision of engineering\nthermodynamics before considering the design point performance of gas\nturbines, including both simple and complex cycles. The performance of gas\nturbine components (compressors, combustors and turbines) is also discussed.\nMeans to improve dry low-emission combustion systems are included. The\nprediction and modelling of the off-design performance of gas turbines is\ndiscussed, including the modelling of complex cycles which employ\nintercooling, reheat and regeneration. The impact and detection of performance\nxv",

Control system performance, including the prediction of the transient\nperformance of gas turbines, is considered. Furthermore, the application of\ncontrol systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion\nsystems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.\nThe CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which\ncorrespond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine\nconfigurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in\nthe field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of\nindustrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas\nturbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:\n(1) simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on\nperformance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of\ninlet and exhaust losses;\n(2) simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life\nand emissions;\n(3) simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using\nturbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on\nperformance, creep life and emissions;\n(4) simulate control system performance on engine operability including\nproportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;\n(5) simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on\nperformance and emissions.\nThere are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator.\nExercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and\noperability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical\nexercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance\nand some worked examples are given.\nThe simulators include other useful features and can show:\n(1) impact on life cycle costs, revenue and profitability (including the impact\nof emissions taxes such as CO 2 and NO x on life cycle costs and, thus,\nprofitability);\n(2) output from the turbine inlet cooling simulation which can be used to\nevaluate the suitability of turbine inlet cooling for any gas turbine for a\nparticular site;\n(3) trends for many engine parameters, including key parameters such as\nEGT and speeds that protect the engine from damage;\n(4) compressor characteristics and the operating point during engine\ntransients;\n(5) bar charts;\n(6) simulated data that can be exported to other computer packages (e.g.\nMicrosoft Excel spreadsheets).",
