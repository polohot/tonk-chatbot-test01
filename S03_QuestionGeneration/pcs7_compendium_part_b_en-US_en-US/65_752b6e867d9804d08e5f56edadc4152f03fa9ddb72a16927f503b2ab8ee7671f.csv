# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

|Properties FAI6xISBit HART (R-/57)|Properties FAI6xISBit HART (R-/57)|
|---|
|General Addresses|Parameters|
|Identification|Redundancy|
|Parameters|Value|
|source address|CPU 410-5H|
|target_address|1021|
|DIP switch setting to o)|111101 PSTO|
|monitoring time (ms)|2500|

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the PROFIsafe monitoring time

|minimum PROFIsafe monitoring time|Variants|
|---|---|
|Tpsto|670 ms|

S7ftime.xlsm distinguishes 7 possibilities depending on the hardware configuration:

- Version 1: Single-channel F I/Os via PROFIBUS-DP or PROFINET IO
- Version 2: Single-channel switched F I/Os or redundantly switched F I/Os via PROFIBUS-DP or PROFINET IO
- Variant 3: Single-channel F PA field device via DP/PA coupler
- Variant 4: Single channel F PA device via DP/PA Link
- Variant 5: Single-channel switched F PA device via DP/PA Link
- Variant 6: Single-channel switched F I/O via Y-Link
- Version 7: Single-channel F I/Os via IE/PB link
- Variant 8: Single-channel F PA field device via CFU

The F-monitoring time must be calculated for the relevant variant of each F-signal module type or each device, and the values for the cyclic interrupt OB must be calculated as well. To do this, select the appropriate configuration variant and enter the parameters in the corresponding line.
