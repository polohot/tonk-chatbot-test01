|Max. ",Does the text provide a complete specification for communication delay?,The text provides a specific delay (320 ms) but only hints at a maximum ('Max.') without details.,Partial: specifies 320 ms delay but lacks complete info on maximum delay.,"It mentions 320 ms and 'Max.', but 'Max.' isn't quantified.",Only complete for current delay (320 ms); maximum is noted but not specified.,Incomplete for maximum delay; only 320 ms is fully specified.

|Max. ",What could 'Max.' refer to in the context of the text?,"'Max.' likely refers to the maximum possible communication delay, though unspecified.","It probably denotes the upper limit of communication delay, without a given value.","In this context, 'Max.' seems to indicate the highest allowable delay, details absent.","The term 'Max.' may be pointing towards the peak communication delay, not detailed.","Implies maximum communication delay threshold, exact figure not provided."

|Max. ",What is missing from the communication delay information provided?,A specific value for the maximum communication delay ('Max.') is missing.,"The text omits the numerical maximum delay, only mentioning 'Max.'.","Details on the maximum delay are absent, only 'Max.' is noted.","Lacks a defined upper limit for the delay, despite referencing 'Max.'.",Missing: concrete figure for the maximum communication delay.

|Max. ",What implications does the communication delay have without maximum specification?,"Without knowing the maximum, it's hard to assess system limits or performance.",Lack of maximum delay info leaves performance boundaries undefined.,Unspecified maximum delay complicates understanding of potential delays.,Absence of max delay details may lead to uncertainty in delay expectations.,Not specifying the maximum delay obscures the full scope of possible delays.
