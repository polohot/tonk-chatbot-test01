The configured authorization levels are required to operate the SWC_QOS faceplate once the adaptations are made. In this example, an operator with authorization level No. 5 can initiate the transaction, after which an operator with authorization level No. 106 (e.g. the safety engineer) must confirm the transaction to put it into effect. Authorization level No.106 must be created in the ""User Administrator"" in WinCC Explorer and assigned to the user.
