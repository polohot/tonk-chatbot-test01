# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Parallel interconnection

To improve performance you can connect two digital outputs of the module for an actuator in parallel (channel coupling). This increase in performance is only permitted on the same module and between the following channels:

- Channel 0 and channel 1: Connection between terminal 3 and 7
- Channel 2 and channel 3: Connection between terminal 11 and 15
