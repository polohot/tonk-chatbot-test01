# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.1 Introduction

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state. ",What are the benefits of using pre-assembled cables with MTAs?,"They significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning, and help avoid wiring errors.","Pre-assembled cables lower costs and time for cabling, while minimizing the risk of wiring mistakes.","Using these cables with MTAs cuts down on cabling expenses and time, and prevents errors.","The main advantages are reduced cabling time and costs, along with fewer wiring errors.","Benefits include decreased commissioning time, lower costs, and reduced likelihood of wiring errors."

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

2-out-of-3 selection uses three sensors and, for example, three F-AI modules. In the example, each sensor is wired to channel 0 of an F-AI module. The individual signals are then evaluated in the user program. SIL 3 can be achieved with a 2-channel configuration.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.1 Introduction

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state. ",What is the purpose of the F-blocks in the S7 F-Systems optional package?,"They are used to create a fail-safe user program with the CFC editor, including functions for detecting and reacting to errors.","F-blocks enable the development of a fail-safe user program, offering error detection and response capabilities.",The purpose is to facilitate the creation of a safety program with functions for error handling and safety maintenance.,They provide the means to program safety functions and ensure errors are detected and appropriately reacted to.,"F-blocks support the creation of a fail-safe program, incorporating error detection and safety maintenance features."
