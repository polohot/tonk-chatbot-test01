# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset. ",What is the purpose of the SWC_QOS function in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,"The SWC_QOS function is used for fail-safe acknowledgment, allowing the re-integration of F I/Os into the safety program via an operator prompt on the OS.",It reports an acknowledgment request as an operator prompt and generates an acknowledgment pulse after successful operation.,To enable the re-integration of F channel drivers into the safety program by executing a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.,The function facilitates the generation of fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system for re-integrating F I/Os.,"SWC_QOS serves as an interface for displaying the 'Fail-safe acknowledgment' function on the OS, involving blocks like F_SWC_P and F_SWC_BO in the safety program."

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset. ",What are the operator types for 'Fail-safe acknowledgment' in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,"A transaction can be performed by an individual operator or by two operators, where one initiates the change and the other confirms it.","There are two types: a single operator handling all steps, or two operators with one as the initiator and the other as the confirmer.",Operator types include individual operators performing all steps or a pair where the first initiates and the second confirms the change.,"The system supports transactions by one operator or a duo, with the latter involving separate initiator and confirmer roles.","For 'Fail-safe acknowledgment', operations can be conducted by a single operator or a team of two, dividing the initiation and confirmation tasks."

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset. ",What connections are necessary for the 'Fail-safe acknowledgment' function to operate correctly in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,"Connect AKT_VAL output of F_SWC_BO to AKT_Q input of SWC_QOS, and OUT output of F_SWC_BO to ACK_REI inputs of relevant F blocks.",Essential connections include linking ACK_REQ outputs of fail-safe channel drivers to ACK_REQ input on SWC_QOS.,"For operation, connect F_SWC_BO's outputs to SWC_QOS and relevant F blocks, and ensure channel driver ACK_REQ outputs are linked to SWC_QOS.","Necessary links involve F_SWC_BO to SWC_QOS and F blocks, plus channel driver ACK_REQ outputs to SWC_QOS's ACK_REQ input.","Correct operation requires interconnecting F_SWC_BO with SWC_QOS and target F blocks, alongside channel driver ACK_REQ to SWC_QOS connections."
