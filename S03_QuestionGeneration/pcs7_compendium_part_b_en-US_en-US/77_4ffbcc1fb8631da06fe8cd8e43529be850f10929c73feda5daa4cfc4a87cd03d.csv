Operational procedures

During maintenance work in or while making changes to a plant, the operational procedures must be followed at all times.

Before changes can be made to safety-related parts of the plant or functions, a risk assessment relating to the change itself and how it is to be made must be carried out, particularly if it is to be made during operation. Only make changes if a risk assessment has been carried out beforehand and ensure that change instructions resulting from this are followed. If necessary, test program changes by loading them into a test CPU and checking the function.

Operational procedures

During maintenance work in or while making changes to a plant, the operational procedures must be followed at all times.

Before changes can be made to safety-related parts of the plant or functions, a risk assessment relating to the change itself and how it is to be made must be carried out, particularly if it is to be made during operation. Only make changes if a risk assessment has been carried out beforehand and ensure that change instructions resulting from this are followed. If necessary, test program changes by loading them into a test CPU and checking the function.

An S7-400 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by at least two passwords. Make sure you have the required access authorizations.

",How is an S7-400 F/FH system protected when operated as a safety system?,"It is secured by at least two passwords, ensuring that only authorized personnel can make changes.",Dual password protection is implemented to safeguard the S7-400 F/FH system against unauthorized access.,The system employs a minimum of two passwords to control access and modifications.,Protection is achieved through the requirement of two passwords for any operational or configuration changes.,"To maintain security, the S7-400 F/FH system mandates at least two passwords for access and alterations."

Internal F-channel drivers are recreated whenever any changes affecting the ""chart and parameters"" are made, whereby any interconnections previously established are lost and changed parameters to the inputs of the F-channel drivers are overwritten with the default values. This is why you are not allowed to change parameters or perform interconnections in this driver chart.

The operation of the safety matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS.

If parameter changes are required to the F-channel drivers (an extended input signal range for example) or if signals used by an F-channel driver also used elsewhere in the program (for example, for the display or interlocking in the standard program), it is recommended that you create a process tag (CFC) for the signal. In this case, you can enable the ""Imported channel drivers (IEA support)"" function when transferring the matrix to the project.

In this way, not only the process value and its status is interconnected to the Safety Matrix, the inputs ""SIM_IN"", ""SIM_ON"", and ""SIM_V"", which the matrix uses for the maintenance function, as well as ""ACK_REI"" and ""ACK_REQ"", are also used to signal an acknowledgment request in the Safety Matrix and perform acknowledgment from here.

To enable the Safety Matrix to integrate external F-channel drivers into its full scope of functions, the ""SIM_IN"", ""SIM_ON"", ""SIM_V"", and ""ACK_REI"" I/Os may not be interconnected, since the Safety Matrix does not change the existing logic and thus cannot interconnect the inputs of the F-channel driver.

Channel drivers of types F_CH...*, F_PA…, F_Q… and F-typicals can be incorporated from Safety Matrix V6.2 and higher using the ""customer-specific"" option.
