Deactivating the light test

For the purpose of the test, 1-signals are connected to the output while the output is inactive (output signal ""0""). This setting activates the output briefly (&lt; 1 ms) (= ""light period""). The dark test, which the module performs cyclically, is sufficient for SIL 2. This involves connecting 0 signals to the output while it is active. The output is deactivated briefly (&lt; 1 ms) (""dark period"") in order to detect short circuits. In order to detect cross circuits between outputs, during the dark test various bit patterns are issued one after the other to a group of outputs (first the left half of the module, then the right half). For SIL 3, the light test also needs to be performed or the output switched at least once a day.

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Deactivating the light test

For the purpose of the test, 1-signals are connected to the output while the output is inactive (output signal ""0""). This setting activates the output briefly (&lt; 1 ms) (= ""light period""). The dark test, which the module performs cyclically, is sufficient for SIL 2. This involves connecting 0 signals to the output while it is active. The output is deactivated briefly (&lt; 1 ms) (""dark period"") in order to detect short circuits. In order to detect cross circuits between outputs, during the dark test various bit patterns are issued one after the other to a group of outputs (first the left half of the module, then the right half). For SIL 3, the light test also needs to be performed or the output switched at least once a day.
