Where ""1oo1 evaluation"" is concerned, the value displayed is not relevant. The discrepancy analysis for equivalence/non-equivalence is used for fail-safe inputs in order to detect errors from the temporal characteristic of two signals with identical functionality.

The discrepancy analysis is started whenever different levels (when testing for non-equivalence: the same level) are detected on two associated input signals. A test is run to see whether, once a configurable period of time known as the discrepancy time has elapsed, the difference (when testing for non-equivalence: the match) disappears. If not, there is a discrepancy error. The discrepancy time extends the system response time. ",What are the two parameterized discrepancy behaviors mentioned?,The two behaviors are 'Provide last valid value' and 'provide 0 value'.,'Provide last valid value' and 'provide 0 value' are the two discrepancy behaviors.,They include providing the last valid value or a zero value.,Options are to either give the last valid value or set the value to zero.,The behaviors specified are to supply the last valid value or to supply a zero value.
