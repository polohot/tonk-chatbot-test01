# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.
