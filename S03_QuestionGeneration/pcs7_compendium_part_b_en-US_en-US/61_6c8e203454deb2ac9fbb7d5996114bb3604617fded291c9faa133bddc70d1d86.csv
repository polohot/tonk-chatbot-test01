The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max. ",How can the maximum F-cycle time be modified in the F_CYC_CO block?,Modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block within the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart.,Adjust the MAX_CYC value in the F_CYC_CO block located in the @F_CycCo-OB3x chart to change the maximum F-cycle time.,The maximum F-cycle time can be altered by editing the F_CYC_CO block's MAX_CYC parameter in the @F_CycCo-OB3x chart.,"To change the default 3000 ms, update the MAX_CYC setting in the F_CYC_CO block found in the @F_CycCo-OB3x chart.",Direct modification of the F_CYC_CO block's MAX_CYC in the @F_CycCo-OB3x chart allows adjustment of the maximum F-cycle time.

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.
