Group diagnostics

If you check this box for a specific channel, a channel-specific event (a wire break, for example) will trigger an error reaction in the safety program (the substitute value is activated on the channel driver and QBAD is set). If ""Enable diagnostics interrupt"" is selected, a diagnostics interrupt will be triggered in the CPU and a corresponding process control message will be sent on the OS. The ""Group diagnostics"" parameter is used to activate and deactivate the transfer of channel-specific diagnostic messages (e.g. wire break, short circuit) on F signal modules to the CPU.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

For the following F signal modules, group diagnostics needs to be activated whenever a channel is activated:

- SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR (order no. 6ES7326-1RF00-0AB0; 6ES7326-1RF01-0AB0)
- SM 326; DI 24 x DC 24 V (order no. 6ES7326-1BK00-0AB0)
- SM 336; DO 10 x DC 24V/2A (order no. 6ES7326-2BF00-0AB0)
- SM 326; AI 6 x 13 Bit (order no. 6ES7336-1HE00-0AB0)

With all other F signal modules, this takes place automatically when you activate a channel. To maintain an overview, you should deactivate group diagnostics on input or output channels which are not in use on the F signal modules or wire the module so that no channel errors occur.

Note
Where fail-safe input and output modules in safety mode are concerned, group diagnostics must be active on all connected channels. Please check that group diagnostics has only been deactivated for input and output channels which are not in use.

# 6.4.4 Activating channels

With fail-safe signal modules, it is not possible to make and download changes in runtime due to their design. You can find additional information about changes in HW Config in the section Changes in HW Config (Page 179).

In order to be able to use free channels on F signal modules for expansion during operation, the channels in the HW Config must be enabled and configured accordingly beforehand. Configure the channels differently in order to be able to connect different sensor types. Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

For the following F signal modules, group diagnostics needs to be activated whenever a channel is activated:

- SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR (order no. 6ES7326-1RF00-0AB0; 6ES7326-1RF01-0AB0)
- SM 326; DI 24 x DC 24 V (order no. 6ES7326-1BK00-0AB0)
- SM 336; DO 10 x DC 24V/2A (order no. 6ES7326-2BF00-0AB0)
- SM 326; AI 6 x 13 Bit (order no. 6ES7336-1HE00-0AB0)

With all other F signal modules, this takes place automatically when you activate a channel. To maintain an overview, you should deactivate group diagnostics on input or output channels which are not in use on the F signal modules or wire the module so that no channel errors occur.

Note
Where fail-safe input and output modules in safety mode are concerned, group diagnostics must be active on all connected channels. Please check that group diagnostics has only been deactivated for input and output channels which are not in use.

# 6.4.4 Activating channels

With fail-safe signal modules, it is not possible to make and download changes in runtime due to their design. You can find additional information about changes in HW Config in the section Changes in HW Config (Page 179).

In order to be able to use free channels on F signal modules for expansion during operation, the channels in the HW Config must be enabled and configured accordingly beforehand. Configure the channels differently in order to be able to connect different sensor types. Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs on a F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.

Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs on a F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

Group diagnostics

If you check this box for a specific channel, a channel-specific event (a wire break, for example) will trigger an error reaction in the safety program (the substitute value is activated on the channel driver and QBAD is set). If ""Enable diagnostics interrupt"" is selected, a diagnostics interrupt will be triggered in the CPU and a corresponding process control message will be sent on the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs on a F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)
