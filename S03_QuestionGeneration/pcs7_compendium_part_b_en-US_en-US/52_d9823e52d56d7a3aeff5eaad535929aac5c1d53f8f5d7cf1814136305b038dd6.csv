# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10.5 Operator authorizations for Secure Write Command

Operation with the Secure Write Command functions consists of a two-step action sequence. In the first operating step, the ""Initiator"" initiates the change, after which the ""Confirmer"" checks and confirms the change in the second operating step. These steps can be performed by either a single operator or two different operators. The ""User Administrator"" in WinCC Explorer is used to assign operator authorizations for the user(s).

The default operator authorizations correspond to the user hierarchies from PCS 7:

- Initiator No.5, ""Process operations""
- Confirmer: No. 6, ""Higher-order process control"".

These required operating authorizations can be adapted to the specific project.
