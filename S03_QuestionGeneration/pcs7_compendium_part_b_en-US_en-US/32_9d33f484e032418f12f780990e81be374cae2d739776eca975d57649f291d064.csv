A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test. Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

# Short-circuit level

The ""short-circuit level"" parameter determines the value of the load which, if undershot, leads to the module diagnosing a short circuit and switching off the channel. This means that in the range between employing the current limiting (the inflection point on the output curve) and the reaching of the short-circuit level, no diagnostics are transmitted. The channel remains switched on until the load undershoots the short-circuit level.

Overload

If you use the parameter ""overload"" in addition to the parameter ""short-circuit level"", the following will result:

- In the range between employing the current limiting (the inflection point on the output curve) up to the reaching of the short-circuit level, an ""overload"" diagnostic is transmitted and an entry in the diagnostic buffer is made, without the module switching off the channel.
- The ""short-circuit level"" parameter in turn determines the value of the load which, if undershot, leads to the module diagnosing a short circuit and switching off the channel.
