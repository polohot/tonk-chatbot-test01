Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the project engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured ""in conformance with PCS 7"" as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium is divided into the following parts:

- Configuration guidelines including checklist
- Process safety including two checklists
- Technical functions with SFC types
- Operation and maintenance including checklist
- Hardware installation including checklist
- Industrial Security

# Subject of Part B - Process safety

This compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration and corresponds to the procedure described in the documentation for S7 F/FH Systems, whereby numerous practical experiences were evaluated. The description relates to working with the project and the parameter settings of the components it contains but not the application itself.

Compendium Part B is dedicated to the implementation of the fail-safe part of an S7 program.

It examines the following F-software components:

- S7 F-Systems
- SIMATIC Safety Matrix

# Checklists

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the project engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured ""in conformance with PCS 7"" as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium is divided into the following parts:

- Configuration guidelines including checklist
- Process safety including two checklists
- Technical functions with SFC types
- Operation and maintenance including checklist
- Hardware installation including checklist
- Industrial Security

# Subject of Part B - Process safety

This compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration and corresponds to the procedure described in the documentation for S7 F/FH Systems, whereby numerous practical experiences were evaluated. The description relates to working with the project and the parameter settings of the components it contains but not the application itself.

Compendium Part B is dedicated to the implementation of the fail-safe part of an S7 program.

It examines the following F-software components:

- S7 F-Systems
- SIMATIC Safety Matrix

# Checklists
