Here, you can switch off HART communication on specific channels in a non-safety-related manner, as well as enable HART diagnostics options and determine how often the module will attempt to establish HART communication with the transducer before a message is issued.

In the case of HART devices for which parameter assignment cannot be interlocked, HART communication must be switched off.

# Reintegration following a discrepancy error

You use this parameter to determine when a discrepancy error is considered lifted and, therefore, when a reintegration of the affected input channels is possible. You can choose between the following parameter options:

- ""Test 0 signal necessary""
If you have configured ""Test 0 signal necessary"", a discrepancy error is only considered lifted once a 0 signal is present at both input channels concerned. ","What is the role of the 'Startup time of se,' parameter in the EM 8 F-DI NAMUR Ex module?","The 'Startup time of se,' parameter defines the initialization period for the sensor.",It sets the duration required for the sensor to stabilize after power-up before active monitoring begins.,This parameter specifies the wait time post-startup to ensure the sensor is ready for accurate readings.,"Determines the stabilization phase for the sensor, ensuring reliable data from the outset.","Configures the initial delay after startup, allowing the sensor to reach operational stability before processing inputs."
