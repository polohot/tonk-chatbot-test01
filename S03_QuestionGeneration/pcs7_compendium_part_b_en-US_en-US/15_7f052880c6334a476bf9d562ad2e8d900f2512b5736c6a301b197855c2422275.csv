# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.2.2 Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling

Priority class

In order to prevent time monitoring (F-CYC_CO or the monitoring time of modules) from being triggered in the event of a CPU that is starting up in the H system being coupled/updated, you need to set the priority of the cyclic interrupt OBs allocated to the F-program (OB 30 to OB 38) to &gt; 15 on the ""Cyclic Interrupts"" tab (see Monitoring times).

""Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling"" is an H parameter containing the number of the cyclic interrupt OB which is called specifically by the operating system when the standby CPU is updated, once all interrupts have been disabled. Here, enter the number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the highest priority, to which F-blocks are assigned in CFC.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# 6.2.3 Monitoring times

While the standby CPU is being updated, the FH system checks that the scan cycle time extension, the communication delay, and the disabling time for priority classes > 15 do not exceed the maximum values you have set. It also ensures that the minimum I/O retention time that has been configured is observed.

",How does the FH system ensure the minimum I/O retention time is observed?,By checking that the configured minimum I/O retention time is not exceeded during the standby CPU update.,It monitors to ensure the set I/O retention time is adhered to during updates.,The system verifies I/O retention time compliance during CPU updates.,Ensures the minimum I/O retention time is maintained throughout the update process.,FH system checks confirm I/O retention time limits are respected during updates.

Note

Processing is also paused briefly in the master CPU for the purpose of updating a CPU that is starting up (see Monitoring times). If this is only to occur at certain times defined by the plant operator, ""Standby STEO"" must be selected as the error reaction. Following this, maintenance personnel must carry out a self-test on both CPUs at an appropriate point in time, by performing a non-buffered CPU startup.

Priority class

In order to prevent time monitoring (F-CYC_CO or the monitoring time of modules) from being triggered in the event of a CPU that is starting up in the H system being coupled/updated, you need to set the priority of the cyclic interrupt OBs allocated to the F-program (OB 30 to OB 38) to &gt; 15 on the ""Cyclic Interrupts"" tab (see Monitoring times).

""Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling"" is an H parameter containing the number of the cyclic interrupt OB which is called specifically by the operating system when the standby CPU is updated, once all interrupts have been disabled. Here, enter the number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the highest priority, to which F-blocks are assigned in CFC.

It also ensures that the minimum I/O retention time that has been configured is observed.

","What are the consequences of exceeding the maximum set values for scan cycle time extension, communication delay, or disabling time during standby CPU update?",The FH system will detect and potentially halt operations if these maximums are surpassed.,Exceeding these values may trigger system checks leading to operational pauses.,Surpassing set maximums can cause the system to enforce corrective measures.,The system monitors these parameters closely to prevent exceeding set limits.,"Operations may be interrupted if scan cycle, communication delay, or disabling times exceed maximums."
