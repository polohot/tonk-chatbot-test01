# 7.9.3 Activating safety mode

Following a download of changes, you will need to reactivate safety mode in order to ensure secure execution of the safety program.

# Procedure

1. Select the CPU or its S7 program in the SIMATIC Manager.
2. Select the menu command ""Options > Edit Safety Program"".
3. Click the ""Safety mode"" button.
4. Confirm activation of the safety mode.

# Note

If, when safety mode is deactivated, the safety program detects a safety-related error, it will disable the option to activate safety mode. A corresponding message will appear indicating how you can rectify the problem.
