Introduction

Time monitoring of fail-safe communication between 2 F-CPUs is implemented in the send and receive blocks F_SENDR and F_RCVR or F_SENDBO and F_RCVBO with the same TIMEOUT monitoring time, which needs to be configured on both the send and receive blocks. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xlsm.

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

Communication between F-CPUs (TIMEOUT parameter)

CPU 1, sender

- TCI1: Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the send blocks F_SENDBO or F_SENDR are called.
- TDelay1, F_SEND: Maximum communication delay when updating the standby in the S7 FH system with call of F_SENDBO or F_SENDR. Only relevant for redundant S7 FH systems. Enter a 0 if you are not using an S7 FH system.
- TCiR1: CiR synchronization time. Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TCiRmax1: Upper limit of the CiR synchronization time (default setting: 1s). Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.

CPU 2, recipient

- TCiRmax2: Upper limit of the CiR synchronization time (default setting: 1s). Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TCiR2: CiR synchronization time. Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TDelay2, F-Rec: Maximum communication delay when updating the standby in the FH system with call of F_RCVBO or F_RCVR. Only relevant for redundant S7 FH systems. Enter 0 if you are not using an S7 FH-system.
- TCI2: Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive blocks F_RCVBO or F_RCVR are called.

With the exception of the TDelay1/Delay2 parameters, all the parameters are described in Section Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137).

Introduction

Time monitoring of fail-safe communication between 2 F-CPUs is implemented in the send and receive blocks F_SENDR and F_RCVR or F_SENDBO and F_RCVBO with the same TIMEOUT monitoring time, which needs to be configured on both the send and receive blocks. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xlsm.
