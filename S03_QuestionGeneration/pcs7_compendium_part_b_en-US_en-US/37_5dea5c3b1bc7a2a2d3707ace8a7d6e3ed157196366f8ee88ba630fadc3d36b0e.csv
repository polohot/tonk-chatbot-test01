- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for receiving
- F blocks for data conversion from standard value to F-structure

- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

@F_OUT_xx_y Blocks which further process output values of F-blocks (communication send blocks, conversion blocks from F-to standard data types, drivers for F-output modules, F_PLK, F_PLK_O, and F_DIAG for program sequence control)

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37
- Name: HS104
- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for receiving
- F blocks for data conversion from standard value to F-structure

- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

@F_OUT_xx_y Blocks which further process output values of F-blocks (communication send blocks, conversion blocks from F-to standard data types, drivers for F-output modules, F_PLK, F_PLK_O, and F_DIAG for program sequence control)

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37
- Name: HS104
- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# 7.2.4 Run sequence of F-blocks

# Defining the run sequence

You define the run sequence in the CFC editor in the same way as for a standard user program. Changing the run sequence also changes the collective signature.

# Correct run sequence of F-blocks

The sequence of the F-blocks within the F-shutdown group is relevant. The number of F-runtime groups the F-shutdown group has been split into is of no relevance. Essentially, the correct run sequence of the various F-block types is as follows:

1. Placed automatically:
- F module driver for F-signal modules with inputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for receiving
- F blocks for data conversion from standard value to F-structure
- F modules with OS connection
2. F channel drivers for inputs
3. F blocks for user logic

2. Placed automatically:
- F block F_PLK
- F block F_PSG_M
- F module driver for F-signal modules with outputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for sending
- F block F_PLK_O
- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37

- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

# 7.2.7 Data exchange between the F user program and standard user program

The standard program and the F-program use different data formats. Accordingly, special conversion blocks have to be used for data exchange.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.
