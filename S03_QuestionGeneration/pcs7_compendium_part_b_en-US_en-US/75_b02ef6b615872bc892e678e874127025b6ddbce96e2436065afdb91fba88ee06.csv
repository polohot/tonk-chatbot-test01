# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

# 8.2 Documenting a Safety Matrix

A Safety Matrix is documented via menu item ""Options > Reports > Configuration Report"". This displays all of the configurations in the matrix in a text file; they can then be printed or saved in this format.

Changing the minor version number also changes the signature. Both values are downloaded to the AS. During online access from the engineering tool or OS, the values are compared and a message is output if any differences are detected. If a matrix with a modified version number and signature is downloaded to the CPU, the OS server and single stations will need to be compiled and downloaded as well.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

",What is the significance of the EN_SWC input being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC?,Preventing overwriting ensures that a configured '1' at the EN_SWC input remains unchanged during transfer.,"To maintain the EN_SWC input's '1' setting, overwriting must be avoided during the transfer to CFC.","Overwriting the EN_SWC input during transfer could alter its '1' configuration, hence prevention is key.",Ensuring the EN_SWC input isn't overwritten preserves its '1' setting when the matrix is moved to CFC.,The integrity of the EN_SWC input's '1' configuration is maintained by preventing overwrites during CFC transfer.
