# Versioning

A Safety Matrix is determined by its version number, file version, and signature. ",What should be checked regarding the calculated times from S7ftime.xls?,Ensure they meet the requirements of your process.,Check if the times align with your process's needs.,The text advises verifying that the calculated times satisfy process requirements.,It's important to confirm the times are suitable for your specific process.,Make sure the calculated response times are appropriate for your process.

There are 2 different variants:

- One F-shutdown group is present in the signal flow being examined.
- Two F-shutdown groups are present in the signal flow being examined.

You will need the following parameters for the calculation:

|TCI/TCI1/TCI2|Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F-function block has been installed in each case|
|---|---|
|TCImax.proj. / TCImax.proj.1 / TCImax.proj.2|Time set in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F-function block (xx = Number of corresponding cyclic interrupt OB).|
|TFPROG/TFPROG1/TFPROG2|Program runtime of the corresponding cyclic interrupt OB|
|TIMEOUT|Time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the F_R_BO or F_R_R block|

# CPU-to-CPU communication (optional)

If your signal is transferred from one CPU to another, select ""Yes"" in the header. For calculation purposes, you require the time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the send and receive blocks for communication.

If CPU-to-CPU communication is not taking place, leave the default setting (""No"") unchanged. The next section, ""Processing in the 2nd CPU"", will not be taken into account during calculation in this case.

# Result

S7ftime.xls returns two groups each with 3 times.

|max_ response time from the input terminal of the F-IIO (input) to the output terminal of the F-IIO (output)|if there are no faults/errors|461 ms|
|---|---|---|
| |if there is a fault/error|1748 ms|
| |for any run time of the standard or fault-tolerant system|3571 ms|

|max: response time from sensor to actuator|if there are no faults/errors|661 ms|
|---|---|---|
| |if there is a fault/error|1948 ms|
| |for any run time of the standard or fault-tolerant system|3771 ms|

The lower group takes into account the delay times of the sensor and actuator.

Check that the times calculated meet the requirements of your process.
