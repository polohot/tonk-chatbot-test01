The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

In the processing industry, no evaluation is generally performed between 2 signals on the module. 1oo1 is set for sensor evaluation. This makes all the signals available in the user program, where they can be linked in 1oo2 or 2oo3, depending on what is required. If 1oo2 evaluation is to be implemented on the module, you can find the parameter description for discrepancy handling in the online help.
