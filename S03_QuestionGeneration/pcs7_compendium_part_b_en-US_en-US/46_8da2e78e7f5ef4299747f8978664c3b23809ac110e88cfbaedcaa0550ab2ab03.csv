# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# 7.10.2 Change process values (SWC_CHG)

# Introduction

The ""Change process values"" function offers you the possibility to change F parameters in the safety program of the OS.

For the ""Change process values"" function S7 F Systems:

- Four F blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CB: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CR: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_CHG: Interface for displaying the ""Process value change"" function on the OS.
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Change process values""

With the ""Change process values"" function, you can change F parameters in the safety program of an F CPU if you perform a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time. The entire change operation is referred to as a ""transaction"".

# Operator types for ""Change process values""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the corresponding SWC_CHG faceplate.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

With the ""Change process values"" function, a BOOL value can be switched on/off by the OS or a REAL value can be specified. For each F parameter, there is a block (""F_SWC_CB"", ""F_SWC_CR"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output is connected to the ""SWC_CHG"" block to visualize the current value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CB"" block to the ""AKT_V_B"" input on the ""SWC_CHG"" block for changing a BOOL value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CR"" block to the ""SWC_CHG"" block AKT_V_R input for changing a REAL value.

The changed process value is available for further processing in the safety program at the ""OUT"" output of the ""F_SWC_CB"" and ""F_SWC_CR"" F devices.

Note

One ""SWC_CHG"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy. Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_CHG"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# 7.10.2 Change process values (SWC_CHG)

# Introduction

The ""Change process values"" function offers you the possibility to change F parameters in the safety program of the OS.

For the ""Change process values"" function S7 F Systems:

- Four F blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CB: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CR: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_CHG: Interface for displaying the ""Process value change"" function on the OS.
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Change process values""

With the ""Change process values"" function, you can change F parameters in the safety program of an F CPU if you perform a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time. The entire change operation is referred to as a ""transaction"".

# Operator types for ""Change process values""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the corresponding SWC_CHG faceplate.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

With the ""Change process values"" function, a BOOL value can be switched on/off by the OS or a REAL value can be specified. For each F parameter, there is a block (""F_SWC_CB"", ""F_SWC_CR"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output is connected to the ""SWC_CHG"" block to visualize the current value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CB"" block to the ""AKT_V_B"" input on the ""SWC_CHG"" block for changing a BOOL value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CR"" block to the ""SWC_CHG"" block AKT_V_R input for changing a REAL value.

The changed process value is available for further processing in the safety program at the ""OUT"" output of the ""F_SWC_CB"" and ""F_SWC_CR"" F devices.

Note

One ""SWC_CHG"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy. Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_CHG"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset. ",How is a transaction defined in the context of changing process values?,A transaction is the entire change operation performed on the OS within a specified time to alter F parameters.,It refers to the complete sequence of operations to change F parameters in the safety program within a set timeframe.,"A transaction encompasses all steps taken on the OS to modify F parameters, completed within a certain duration.","The term 'transaction' describes the full process of changing F parameters via the OS, executed within a predefined time limit.","In this context, a transaction is the series of actions performed on the OS to change F parameters, all within a specified period."

One ""SWC_CHG"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy. Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_CHG"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset. ",What is the role of the 'EN_SWC' input in the 'F_SWC_P' block?,The 'EN_SWC' input enables ('1') or disables ('0') all transactions in a shutdown group.,"It controls the operation of transactions within a shutdown group, turning them on or off.","This input acts as a switch for transactions in a shutdown group, enabling or disabling them.",'EN_SWC' determines whether transactions are active ('1') or inactive ('0') in a shutdown group.,"Through 'EN_SWC', users can activate or deactivate all transactions in a shutdown group as needed."
