# Measuring range

The measuring ranges 0 to 20 mA and 4 to 20 mA are available for selection. With 0 to 20 mA, HART communication is not possible.

# F wire-break detection

In the 4 to 20 mA measuring range and with wire-break detection activated, a message is issued when a current of < 3.6 mA is present. If wire-break detection is deactivated, an underflow message is issued if a current of < 0.4444 mA is present (as with the 0 to 20 mA measuring range).

# Filter

The module filters the input signal throughout the specified number of acquisition cycles. Please note that input signal filtering will lengthen the system's reaction time.
