# 7.10.3 Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

Maintenance Override gives you the option to set bypasses in the safety program from the OS as well as the safety-oriented changing of F-parameters in the safety program of an F-CPU from an OS.

A special safety protocol is used to make changes to F-parameters in safety mode. This meets Safety Integrity Level requirements up to SIL3 in accordance with IEC 61508.

S7 F-systems offers the following for MOS:

- Four F-blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_R: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_MOS: Interface for the display of the MOS function on the OS.
- A template for the temporal limitation of the change (SWC_TR)
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

Transaction for MOS

You can use MOS to modify an F-parameter in the safety program of an F-CPU if you perform a specific sequence of operations on the OS within a specified period of time. The entire change operation is known as a ""transaction"".

",What is the role of the SWC_TR template in the context of MOS?,The SWC_TR template provides a temporal limitation for the change operations in MOS.,It serves to limit the time duration for which changes can be made using the MOS functionality.,SWC_TR is a template that enforces time constraints on modifications performed via MOS.,"For MOS, the SWC_TR template is used to apply time limits to change operations.",The purpose of the SWC_TR template is to restrict the timeframe of changes allowed by MOS.
