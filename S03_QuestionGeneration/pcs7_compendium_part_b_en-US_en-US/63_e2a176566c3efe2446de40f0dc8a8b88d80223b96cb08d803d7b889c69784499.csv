To prevent monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present, MAX_CYC must be set higher than the TCImax calculated for the corresponding cyclic interrupt OB.

- For non-redundant S7 F/FH systems:
- The setting for TCImax must be at least as high as the configured execution time (TCI) of the cyclic interrupt OB.
- For redundant S7 F/FH systems:
- A priority > 15 is used in the S7 F/FH-system for cyclic interrupt OBs with a safety program. The maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15 (TP15) must also be taken into account for updating here.

You can find the value for TCI in the ""Execution"" column of the relevant cyclic interrupt OB, located on the ""Cyclic Interrupts"" tab in the CPU properties.
