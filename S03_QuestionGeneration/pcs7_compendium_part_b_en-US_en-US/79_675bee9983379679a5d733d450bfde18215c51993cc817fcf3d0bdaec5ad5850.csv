# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

Using the ""Compare with"" drop-down list box, you can determine which programs you intend to compare.

- If you have activated the ""Program"" option button, you will be able to select one of the following programs here:

|Reference|Last reference saved for this program|
|---|---|
|Last compilation|Last compilation of the program|
|Online|Program in the state currently downloaded on the F-CPU|
|Another project|Any offline program, click (""Browse..."" to select)|

- If you have activated the ""Reference"" option button, you will be presented with the following selection options:

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

If necessary, change the block sequence in the runtime editor. The ""Optimize run sequence"" function does not optimize F-runtime groups. These are excluded from optimization.

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

Using the ""Compare with"" drop-down list box, you can determine which programs you intend to compare.

- If you have activated the ""Program"" option button, you will be able to select one of the following programs here:

|Reference|Last reference saved for this program|
|---|---|
|Last compilation|Last compilation of the program|
|Online|Program in the state currently downloaded on the F-CPU|
|Another project|Any offline program, click (""Browse..."" to select)|

- If you have activated the ""Reference"" option button, you will be presented with the following selection options:

|Current program|Current offline program|
|---|---|
|Last compilation|Last compilation of the program|
|Online|Program in the state currently downloaded on the F-CPU|
|Another project|Any offline program, click (""Browse..."" to select)|

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

If necessary, change the block sequence in the runtime editor. The ""Optimize run sequence"" function does not optimize F-runtime groups. These are excluded from optimization.

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.
