# Configuring AS functions

# 8.4 Creating step sequences

# SFC types

In the SFC, there are the ""SFC chart"" and ""SFC type"" object types. The SFC type allows the definition of sequential controls and of an expandable interface. You can read about the advantages and disadvantages of SFC types/instances in the manual mentioned above.

Note The creation of SFC types is described in detail in ""Compendium Part C - Technical Functions with SFC Types"".

An SFC type is generally preferred if a step sequencer (SFC) is used several times in the project. The instances are placed in the CFC chart similar to a function block. The SFC type is contained in the associated chart folder.

As of PCS 7 V7.0, the SFC type can be centrally edited in the master data library and all instances in the project can be automatically updated. In addition, ways of accessing the SFC instances are listed in the chart reference data of the CFC.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Method of operation

The Plant Automation Accelerator includes an interface for bidirectional exchange of engineering data with SIMATIC PCS 7. This enables the PAA to also work alternatingly in both programs. For transferring data, the PAA supports a delta view for synchronizing between PAA and PCS 7. The user decides on the requirements and performs supervised bulk data engineering.

The PAA offers the following options for transferring and synchronizing:

- Direct data exchange: If PAA and PCS 7 are installed on the same computer, data is exchanged over an integrated interface in PAA.
- Indirect data exchange: If PAA and PCS 7 are installed on different computers, data is exchanged using XML files.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# 8.5.2 Import/Export Assistant (IEA)

Introduction

During the planning of a plant, a wide variety of data is created, often at a time where no definite control system is planned. By using the import function, this data can be made available to the control system engineering. You use the import/export assistant if you want to frequently use multiple models or process tag types in a project (bulk data processing) and change block parameter descriptions easily.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Scope of functions

The functions that can be used with the IEA include:

- Standardized plant libraries with tested process tag types and models
- Import of plant data (e.g. process tag lists or I/O lists) from the higher-level CAD/CAE environment
- Automatic generation of the AS configuration based on imported process tag lists and process tag types (CMTs cannot be used).
- Creation of the plant hierarchy
- Editing stored process tags
- Automatic derivation of the OS picture hierarchy, automatic connection of blocks, and positioning within pictures
- Automatic creation of an OS archive
- Creation of individual process objects using appropriate graphical tools such as CFC and SFC
- Export of optimized parameters back to the CAD/CAE environment

# Working with the import / export assistant (IEA)

The Import Export Assistant offers the convenient option of creating function charts using process tag types and models. You also are given the option of exporting the files created in PCS 7 (for plant documentation, for example), editing them in Excel, and then importing them back into PCS 7.

The following procedure should be followed when creating process tag types and models:

- Create the process tag types and test them to ensure that they function correctly. Changes made at a later cost time.
- All workers in a multiproject should use the same process tag types. Each worker should be assigned a name band for IEA files he creates. This allows the files to be easily entered into the multiproject. The workers should be able to use the process tag type for import, but should not be allowed to change the template. Changes should always be made from a central location, and then made available to the workers.
- The IEA should be only be used during the configuration phase. Changes to parameters and interconnections in the charts should be made during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) or during commissioning. Since users make changes in the charts and not in the IEA files, any new IEA import may overwrite the changes.
- During the FAT and subsequently while the plant is in process mode, the process object view offers the possibility of editing charts created via the IEA in tabular form. You also have the option here of exporting and importing (see also section:""Managing process tag types with the process object view (Page 195)"").

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Introduction

In the process object view, all the data of the basic control can be displayed in a process control oriented view throughout the project. This means that a multiproject encompasses the data of all the projects within it.

The process object view is mainly used during the FAT and commissioning. These tasks involve working efficiently with great amount of data at a centralized location. The process object view has the advantage that all changeable tags/values of an object (white background) can be centrally edited.

When editing process tags and CFCs, all aspects (automation, I/O connection, messages, operation, and monitoring) can be consistently displayed and documented. Jumps to CFCs, SFCs, HW Config, and to the OS enable you to edit tags/values which cannot be edited in the table (e.g. parameter definition of the models, picture contents).

Note

Information on the structure and on working with the process object view can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Filter function of the process object view

Filtering in the process object view is a comprehensive tool. A filter with a variety of criteria is shown here as an example:

- Process tag type ""FI"" (flow measurements)
- Blocks of type ""MonAnL""
- ""PV_OPScale.High"" connections (measuring range high limit for the faceplate bar graph)

Values can be easily selected, checked, and modified using the different filter functions ""General"", ""Block"", and ""I/O"".

In PCS 7 version V8.1, the process object view has been supplemented with the ""Charts"" tab. All charts contained in the multiproject, including charts without PH assignment, are shown in this tab. This enables charts to be found quickly and simply. Switching from one project to another is not necessary, since all charts are displayed in one tab.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# 8.5.2 Import/Export Assistant (IEA)

Introduction

During the planning of a plant, a wide variety of data is created, often at a time where no definite control system is planned. By using the import function, this data can be made available to the control system engineering. You use the import/export assistant if you want to frequently use multiple models or process tag types in a project (bulk data processing) and change block parameter descriptions easily.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Scope of functions

The functions that can be used with the IEA include:

- Standardized plant libraries with tested process tag types and models
- Import of plant data (e.g. process tag lists or I/O lists) from the higher-level CAD/CAE environment
- Automatic generation of the AS configuration based on imported process tag lists and process tag types (CMTs cannot be used).
- Creation of the plant hierarchy
- Editing stored process tags
- Automatic derivation of the OS picture hierarchy, automatic connection of blocks, and positioning within pictures
- Automatic creation of an OS archive
- Creation of individual process objects using appropriate graphical tools such as CFC and SFC
- Export of optimized parameters back to the CAD/CAE environment

# Working with the import / export assistant (IEA)

The Import Export Assistant offers the convenient option of creating function charts using process tag types and models. You also are given the option of exporting the files created in PCS 7 (for plant documentation, for example), editing them in Excel, and then importing them back into PCS 7.

The following procedure should be followed when creating process tag types and models:

- Create the process tag types and test them to ensure that they function correctly. Changes made at a later cost time.
- All workers in a multiproject should use the same process tag types. Each worker should be assigned a name band for IEA files he creates. This allows the files to be easily entered into the multiproject. The workers should be able to use the process tag type for import, but should not be allowed to change the template. Changes should always be made from a central location, and then made available to the workers.
- The IEA should be only be used during the configuration phase. Changes to parameters and interconnections in the charts should be made during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) or during commissioning. Since users make changes in the charts and not in the IEA files, any new IEA import may overwrite the changes.
- During the FAT and subsequently while the plant is in process mode, the process object view offers the possibility of editing charts created via the IEA in tabular form. You also have the option here of exporting and importing (see also section:""Managing process tag types with the process object view (Page 195)"").

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Introduction

In the process object view, all the data of the basic control can be displayed in a process control oriented view throughout the project. This means that a multiproject encompasses the data of all the projects within it.

The process object view is mainly used during the FAT and commissioning. These tasks involve working efficiently with great amount of data at a centralized location. The process object view has the advantage that all changeable tags/values of an object (white background) can be centrally edited.

When editing process tags and CFCs, all aspects (automation, I/O connection, messages, operation, and monitoring) can be consistently displayed and documented. Jumps to CFCs, SFCs, HW Config, and to the OS enable you to edit tags/values which cannot be edited in the table (e.g. parameter definition of the models, picture contents).

Note

Information on the structure and on working with the process object view can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Filter function of the process object view

Filtering in the process object view is a comprehensive tool. A filter with a variety of criteria is shown here as an example:

- Process tag type ""FI"" (flow measurements)
- Blocks of type ""MonAnL""
- ""PV_OPScale.High"" connections (measuring range high limit for the faceplate bar graph)

Values can be easily selected, checked, and modified using the different filter functions ""General"", ""Block"", and ""I/O"".

In PCS 7 version V8.1, the process object view has been supplemented with the ""Charts"" tab. All charts contained in the multiproject, including charts without PH assignment, are shown in this tab. This enables charts to be found quickly and simply. Switching from one project to another is not necessary, since all charts are displayed in one tab.

# 8.5.2 Import/Export Assistant (IEA)

Introduction

During the planning of a plant, a wide variety of data is created, often at a time where no definite control system is planned. By using the import function, this data can be made available to the control system engineering. You use the import/export assistant if you want to frequently use multiple models or process tag types in a project (bulk data processing) and change block parameter descriptions easily.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Scope of functions

The functions that can be used with the IEA include:

- Standardized plant libraries with tested process tag types and models
- Import of plant data (e.g. process tag lists or I/O lists) from the higher-level CAD/CAE environment
- Automatic generation of the AS configuration based on imported process tag lists and process tag types (CMTs cannot be used).
- Creation of the plant hierarchy
- Editing stored process tags
- Automatic derivation of the OS picture hierarchy, automatic connection of blocks, and positioning within pictures
- Automatic creation of an OS archive
- Creation of individual process objects using appropriate graphical tools such as CFC and SFC
- Export of optimized parameters back to the CAD/CAE environment

# Working with the import / export assistant (IEA)

The Import Export Assistant offers the convenient option of creating function charts using process tag types and models. You also are given the option of exporting the files created in PCS 7 (for plant documentation, for example), editing them in Excel, and then importing them back into PCS 7.

The following procedure should be followed when creating process tag types and models:

- Create the process tag types and test them to ensure that they function correctly. Changes made at a later cost time.
- All workers in a multiproject should use the same process tag types. Each worker should be assigned a name band for IEA files he creates. This allows the files to be easily entered into the multiproject. The workers should be able to use the process tag type for import, but should not be allowed to change the template. Changes should always be made from a central location, and then made available to the workers.
- The IEA should be only be used during the configuration phase. Changes to parameters and interconnections in the charts should be made during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) or during commissioning. Since users make changes in the charts and not in the IEA files, any new IEA import may overwrite the changes.
- During the FAT and subsequently while the plant is in process mode, the process object view offers the possibility of editing charts created via the IEA in tabular form. You also have the option here of exporting and importing (see also section:""Managing process tag types with the process object view (Page 195)"").

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Introduction

In the process object view, all the data of the basic control can be displayed in a process control oriented view throughout the project. This means that a multiproject encompasses the data of all the projects within it.

The process object view is mainly used during the FAT and commissioning. These tasks involve working efficiently with great amount of data at a centralized location. The process object view has the advantage that all changeable tags/values of an object (white background) can be centrally edited.

When editing process tags and CFCs, all aspects (automation, I/O connection, messages, operation, and monitoring) can be consistently displayed and documented. Jumps to CFCs, SFCs, HW Config, and to the OS enable you to edit tags/values which cannot be edited in the table (e.g. parameter definition of the models, picture contents).

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Introduction

In the process object view, all the data of the basic control can be displayed in a process control oriented view throughout the project. This means that a multiproject encompasses the data of all the projects within it.

The process object view is mainly used during the FAT and commissioning. These tasks involve working efficiently with great amount of data at a centralized location. The process object view has the advantage that all changeable tags/values of an object (white background) can be centrally edited.

When editing process tags and CFCs, all aspects (automation, I/O connection, messages, operation, and monitoring) can be consistently displayed and documented. Jumps to CFCs, SFCs, HW Config, and to the OS enable you to edit tags/values which cannot be edited in the table (e.g. parameter definition of the models, picture contents).

Note

Information on the structure and on working with the process object view can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Filter function of the process object view

Filtering in the process object view is a comprehensive tool. A filter with a variety of criteria is shown here as an example:

- Process tag type ""FI"" (flow measurements)
- Blocks of type ""MonAnL""
- ""PV_OPScale.High"" connections (measuring range high limit for the faceplate bar graph)

Values can be easily selected, checked, and modified using the different filter functions ""General"", ""Block"", and ""I/O"".

In PCS 7 version V8.1, the process object view has been supplemented with the ""Charts"" tab. All charts contained in the multiproject, including charts without PH assignment, are shown in this tab. This enables charts to be found quickly and simply. Switching from one project to another is not necessary, since all charts are displayed in one tab.

The relevant chart can be selected using a filter and opened directly from the process object view. Furthermore, the assignment of charts to an AS is visible immediately.

# Exporting and importing inputs/outputs and messages

Through the exporting and importing of attributes you have the option of exporting information on parameters, signals and messages to a file, processing it with standard applications and inputting it (importing it) again.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.4 Creating step sequences

# SFC types

In the SFC, there are the ""SFC chart"" and ""SFC type"" object types. The SFC type allows the definition of sequential controls and of an expandable interface. You can read about the advantages and disadvantages of SFC types/instances in the manual mentioned above.

Note The creation of SFC types is described in detail in ""Compendium Part C - Technical Functions with SFC Types"".

An SFC type is generally preferred if a step sequencer (SFC) is used several times in the project. The instances are placed in the CFC chart similar to a function block. The SFC type is contained in the associated chart folder.

As of PCS 7 V7.0, the SFC type can be centrally edited in the master data library and all instances in the project can be automatically updated. In addition, ways of accessing the SFC instances are listed in the chart reference data of the CFC.

# 8.5.1 PCS 7 Plant Automation Accelerator

Introduction

The PCS 7 Plant Automation Accelerator (PAA) enables integrated engineering of PCS 7 systems. For this purpose, the PAA offers functionalities for bulk engineering based on control module types and also operates as a project execution and documentation tool. Based on consistent data management from product design to product operation, the PAA enables users to reduce configuration and commissioning costs when improving engineering quality.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Method of operation

The Plant Automation Accelerator includes an interface for bidirectional exchange of engineering data with SIMATIC PCS 7. This enables the PAA to also work alternatingly in both programs. For transferring data, the PAA supports a delta view for synchronizing between PAA and PCS 7. The user decides on the requirements and performs supervised bulk data engineering.

The PAA offers the following options for transferring and synchronizing:

- Direct data exchange: If PAA and PCS 7 are installed on the same computer, data is exchanged over an integrated interface in PAA.
- Indirect data exchange: If PAA and PCS 7 are installed on different computers, data is exchanged using XML files.

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# 8.5.2 Import/Export Assistant (IEA)

Introduction

During the planning of a plant, a wide variety of data is created, often at a time where no definite control system is planned. By using the import function, this data can be made available to the control system engineering. You use the import/export assistant if you want to frequently use multiple models or process tag types in a project (bulk data processing) and change block parameter descriptions easily.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Scope of functions

The functions that can be used with the IEA include:

- Standardized plant libraries with tested process tag types and models
- Import of plant data (e.g. process tag lists or I/O lists) from the higher-level CAD/CAE environment
- Automatic generation of the AS configuration based on imported process tag lists and process tag types (CMTs cannot be used).
- Creation of the plant hierarchy
- Editing stored process tags
- Automatic derivation of the OS picture hierarchy, automatic connection of blocks, and positioning within pictures
- Automatic creation of an OS archive
- Creation of individual process objects using appropriate graphical tools such as CFC and SFC
- Export of optimized parameters back to the CAD/CAE environment

# Working with the import / export assistant (IEA)

The Import Export Assistant offers the convenient option of creating function charts using process tag types and models. You also are given the option of exporting the files created in PCS 7 (for plant documentation, for example), editing them in Excel, and then importing them back into PCS 7.

The following procedure should be followed when creating process tag types and models:

- Create the process tag types and test them to ensure that they function correctly. Changes made at a later cost time.
- All workers in a multiproject should use the same process tag types. Each worker should be assigned a name band for IEA files he creates. This allows the files to be easily entered into the multiproject. The workers should be able to use the process tag type for import, but should not be allowed to change the template. Changes should always be made from a central location, and then made available to the workers.
- The IEA should be only be used during the configuration phase. Changes to parameters and interconnections in the charts should be made during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) or during commissioning. Since users make changes in the charts and not in the IEA files, any new IEA import may overwrite the changes.
- During the FAT and subsequently while the plant is in process mode, the process object view offers the possibility of editing charts created via the IEA in tabular form. You also have the option here of exporting and importing (see also section:""Managing process tag types with the process object view (Page 195)"").
