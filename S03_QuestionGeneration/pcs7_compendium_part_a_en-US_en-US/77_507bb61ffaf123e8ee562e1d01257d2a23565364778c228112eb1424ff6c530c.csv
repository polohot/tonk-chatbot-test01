# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

The automation program forms the basis of the automation. This program is configured in the CFC in PCS 7 and typically contains the program logic, including interlocks, as well as the connection to the process I/O. SIMATIC PCS 7 supports configuration with process tags according to the old model, but also the enhanced control module (CM) type model. The main advantage of CM technology over process tags lies in the flexible formation of variants and the optimal connection to a higher-level engineering, project execution and documentation tool such as PCS 7 Plant Automation Accelerator and the COMOS Plant Engineering Software.

# 8.2.1 Process tag types (templates)

A process tag type (template) is a project-specific interconnection of blocks. It serves as a model for a specific automation function.

# Example

A valve-control process tag type from the PCS 7 AP library is shown below. The valve-control process is completed here with the channel blocks for inputs and outputs, the technological blocks ""Intlk02"" and ""VlvL"". The ""Bad"" output of the driver blocks is interconnected to the ""CSF"" error input of the valve block (valve).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

Numerous process tag types are available in the PCS 7 AP library. They serve as a basis and can be adapted to the automation function for a specific project in your master data library.

User-specific process tag types should be created in the same way as the process tag types of the PCS 7 AP library.

# Recommendation for creating custom process tag types

Note the following recommendations:

- Use the comment fields (for describing the logic, for example).
- Use channel blocks between the I/O data provided in the process image and the technological blocks.
- Arrange the blocks on the CFC sheets of the process tag type in a clear manner, e.g. consistently from top left to bottom right.
- Create variants of process tag types. If a valve needs two interlock blocks, for example, create a new process tag type for it.
- Test each process tag type before using it in the project.

Note

Information on creating CFCs and process tag types can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

All process tag types are then to be saved in the master data library and can be maintained and edited there as needed.

The process tags (replicas) in the project result from the process tag types of the master data library - either by manual copying or using the Import/Export Assistant (see also section: Import/Export Assistant (IEA) (Page 193)).

# Introduction

Compared with a process tag type, a control module type (CMT) has the following advantages:

- Instance-specific changes to the instance of the control module are not lost during synchronization of type and instance.
- It is possible to create different instances from one CMT. ",What are the advantages of control module types (CMT) over process tag types according to the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,Control module types (CMT) allow instance-specific changes to not be lost during synchronization and enable the creation of different instances from one CMT.,"Compared to process tag types, CMTs offer the benefit of preserving instance-specific modifications upon synchronization and the flexibility to generate varied instances from a single CMT.",The 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)' highlights two main advantages of CMTs: no loss of instance-specific changes during synchronization and the ability to create diverse instances from one CMT.,Advantages include: 1) Instance-specific changes remain after synchronization. 2) Multiple instances can be derived from a single CMT.,"In the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)', CMTs are noted for their superior flexibility and preservation of modifications, unlike process tag types."

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

The automation program forms the basis of the automation. This program is configured in the CFC in PCS 7 and typically contains the program logic, including interlocks, as well as the connection to the process I/O. SIMATIC PCS 7 supports configuration with process tags according to the old model, but also the enhanced control module (CM) type model. The main advantage of CM technology over process tags lies in the flexible formation of variants and the optimal connection to a higher-level engineering, project execution and documentation tool such as PCS 7 Plant Automation Accelerator and the COMOS Plant Engineering Software.

# 8.2.1 Process tag types (templates)

A process tag type (template) is a project-specific interconnection of blocks. It serves as a model for a specific automation function.

# Example

A valve-control process tag type from the PCS 7 AP library is shown below. The valve-control process is completed here with the channel blocks for inputs and outputs, the technological blocks ""Intlk02"" and ""VlvL"". The ""Bad"" output of the driver blocks is interconnected to the ""CSF"" error input of the valve block (valve).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

Numerous process tag types are available in the PCS 7 AP library. They serve as a basis and can be adapted to the automation function for a specific project in your master data library.

User-specific process tag types should be created in the same way as the process tag types of the PCS 7 AP library.

# Recommendation for creating custom process tag types

Note the following recommendations:

- Use the comment fields (for describing the logic, for example).
- Use channel blocks between the I/O data provided in the process image and the technological blocks.
- Arrange the blocks on the CFC sheets of the process tag type in a clear manner, e.g. consistently from top left to bottom right.
- Create variants of process tag types. If a valve needs two interlock blocks, for example, create a new process tag type for it.
- Test each process tag type before using it in the project.

Note

Information on creating CFCs and process tag types can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

All process tag types are then to be saved in the master data library and can be maintained and edited there as needed.

The process tags (replicas) in the project result from the process tag types of the master data library - either by manual copying or using the Import/Export Assistant (see also section: Import/Export Assistant (IEA) (Page 193)).

Compared with a process tag type, a control module type (CMT) has the following advantages:

- Instance-specific changes to the instance of the control module are not lost during synchronization of type and instance.
- It is possible to create different instances from one CMT.
