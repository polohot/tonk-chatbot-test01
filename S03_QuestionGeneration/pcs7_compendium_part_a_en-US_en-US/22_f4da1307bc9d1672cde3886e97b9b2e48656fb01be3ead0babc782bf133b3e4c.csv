# Using CP16x3/CP16x8

Using a CP16x3/CP16x8 in the engineering station or OS server has the following benefits:

- More than eight AS can be connected.
- High availability AS–OS connections with automatic switching of the communication can be configured (also possible with a network card for CPUs with firmware V6 or higher).
- The ""OS simulation"" function can also be used for a redundant automation system.
- The CP MAC address can have parameters assigned to it or be modified.

Note
If a BCE (Basic Communication Ethernet) module is being used for communication instead of the CP16x3/CP16x8, parameters cannot be assigned to the MAC address. In the event of a fault (e.g. defective module) this may mean that the connections have to be reconfigured by the new MAC address of the replacement module and the project documentation has to be changed.

The following two TCP/UP protocols can be operated in parallel in the CP16x3/CP16x8:

- Windows communication (via the NDIS adapter)
- Communication via the ""S7 online"" access point (can be configured in NetPro/HW config)

Note
Different TCP/IP addresses have to be set in both TCP/IP protocols of the CP16x3/CP16x8 for unique identification purposes. This applies in particular from version PCS 7 V7.1. ",What are the benefits of using a CP16x3/CP16x8 in the engineering station or OS server according to the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,"The benefits include connecting more than eight AS, configuring high availability AS–OS connections with automatic communication switching, using the 'OS simulation' function for a redundant automation system, and assigning or modifying the CP MAC address parameters.","According to the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)', using CP16x3/CP16x8 allows for over eight AS connections, high availability configurations, OS simulation in redundant systems, and MAC address parameter assignment.","Benefits: >8 AS connections, automatic communication switching for high availability, OS simulation for redundancy, and MAC address parameter modification.","In the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)', it's noted that CP16x3/CP16x8 use offers advantages like enhanced AS connectivity, reliable AS-OS communication, redundancy support via OS simulation, and flexible MAC address settings.","The document highlights four main advantages: extended AS connectivity beyond eight, automatic switching for high availability, redundancy-enabled OS simulation, and customizable MAC address parameters."
