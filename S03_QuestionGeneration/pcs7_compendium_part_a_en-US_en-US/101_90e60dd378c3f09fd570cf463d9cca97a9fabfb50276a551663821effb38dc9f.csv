# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.7 Time stamp

Messages are generated in different areas and at various positions within PCS 7. The origin of the message will, therefore, affect its time stamp.

All messages are archived and are displayed in the same way, regardless of their origin. AS and I/O messages are forwarded to the OS servers separately via the plant bus. They already contain the appropriate time stamp. The OS server arranges all messages in the correct order.

To ensure that the correct time stamp is always available, you must configure time synchronization between all the components of the PCS 7 project.

|Origin|Configuration of the message text|Time stamp place of origin|Meaning in PCS 7|
|---|---|---|---|
|Operator station (OS)|In OS ""alarm logging""|In the OS|OS system messages|
|Automation system (AS)|In the instances of the function block (e.g. CTRL_PID or MEAS_MON)|In the AS|Process messages and AS system messages from the SIMATIC station|

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.1 Introduction

Backing up process values and messages

In a PCS 7 plant, you can archive various types of data which are produced in process mode. This data includes process values (analog and binary) and messages.

PCS 7 provides the option of automatically creating archive tags for process values that are marked accordingly. In order for this to happen, the process values must be labeled as relevant for archiving in the SIMATIC Manager using the ""Archive"" attribute. This attribute can only be set for block I/Os intended for operator control and monitoring. The available labels, ""Archiving"" and ""Long-term archiving"", specify whether the process value should also be saved for the long term if a Process Historian is used. If you have selected the ""Create archives"" option, PCS 7 then creates the labeled archive tags automatically when the ""Compile OS"" function is executed.

The recording and archiving times can be adapted to the physical type of the process tag immediately after this step in a clear display (in the SIMATIC Manager process object view, for example).

The individual process tags can be roughly divided into four classes for display purposes:

- Temperature measurement (CT) 10 s to 20 s
- Level measurement (CL) 5 s to 10 s
- Pressure measurement (CP) 3 s to 5 s
- Flow measurement (CF) 0.5 s to 3 s

Depending on how the components have been dimensioned, their values may differ from the example values given here.

By default, archiving is performed locally on the OS servers. The PCS 7 system distinguishes between archive tags which must be archived in intervals of under one minute (TagLogging Fast) and those which must be archived in intervals of over one minute (TagLogging Slow), where one minute is the default setting. The system assigns the tags to two separate archive databases accordingly in online mode. If these archive values are mixed together in the configurable ""process value archives"" or the system archive, this will not have any effect on the process of assigning them to different databases.

# 10.4 Archiving

The following figure shows the structure of the archives, which are designed as circular logs and use single segments.

The archive values associated with TagLogging Fast and also with TagLogging Slow (as of PCS 7 V7.0) are saved in the database in a compressed state, although this does not impair the quality of the values.

The compression factor which can be achieved depends on a number of factors, particularly on whether or not the archive values can be combined during the acquisition of measured values by means of a sufficiently large hysteresis setting.

Compression ensures that the size of the values will be reduced by a factor of 0.5. This results in a value that is usually around 6 bytes per measured value, but which can sometimes reach up to 16 bytes per measured value.

A message with the maximum number of associated values and comments requires 4 KB. The minimum value for a message is 172 bytes.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

# Archive settings

The system always offers two criteria for specifying the archive size of a single segment and
the overall size of the circular log:

- Definition of a time period
- Physical size in bytes

If one of these two criteria is exceeded, this will lead to a switch to the next segment in the
case of a single segment, or to the overwriting of the first segment of the entire circular log.
As the total hard disk capacity available for archiving is predefined, the specification in bytes
is the only criterion which is relevant for the entire circular log.

This specification must be standardized for all three archive databases (TagLogging Fast,
TagLogging Slow, and AlarmLogging) in line with the available hard disk capacity.
A time period during which the Tag Logging should be referred back to is set in the practical
implementation. The required memory is roughly calculated.

When using a Process Historian (PH), we also recommend saving the time range required
for the operator in the process mode of typically 1 to 3 months on the OS servers.

# 10.4.2 Archive configuration for TagLogging Fast and TagLogging Slow

# Calculation

Calculation of the memory requirements of all segments for a specified period of y months
for TagLogging Fast:

To perform this calculation, you will need to know how many archive values are saved per
second on average. The archive variables are displayed in a clear form in the process object
view of the SIMATIC Manager. The average archive load can be determined using the
memory cycle of the variables.

The memory requirements for x bytes are generally calculated as follows:

number of archive values/s * x bytes * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y
months

A specification comprising days or weeks is usually used for a single segment. A segment
change faster than one day may not be used, as this would make the number of segments to
be connected to the MS SQL database when the OS server starts up too large, thus
impairing performance.

Note

As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and
AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.
The maximum size of a single segment should not exceed 700MB (up to PCS 7 V8.0) or
2GB (from PCS 7 V8.1).
The size of a single segment in bytes can also be calculated using the definition provided
above. It is not the decisive criterion, but it does need to be checked.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

Example

You are planning on using a period of around 2 months: You have calculated a mean value of 750 archive values/s for TagLogging Fast.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 60 GB

(750 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 22 GB

(750 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 30 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Fast"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

You proceed in exactly the same way for ""TagLogging Slow"". You have calculated a mean value of 100 archive values/s for TagLogging Slow.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 8 GB (100 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 3 GB (100 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 5 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Slow"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.3 Archive configuration for AlarmLogging

Calculation

Unlike with TagLogging, messages occur as events and you must make assumptions, for example, as regards an average message load which is continuously present. These assumptions can differ from one another considerably, depending on the technology/sector in question.

In practice, however, you can also proceed in another way, by calculating the TagLogging requirement and adding the available, unused hard disk memory space to the AlarmLogging database. This would then become the specification for the maximum size of all segments.

The memory requirements are generally calculated as follows:

Number of messages/s * 4 KB/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y months

# Example

You assume that the number of events in your plant is 1 message/s.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows: approx. 20 GB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- The following is calculated for a single segment per day: approx. 330 MB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 1 day)

Deliberately set this limit higher so that you can still achieve a daily swap-out even if a message burst occurs. In our example, we have selected 700 MB.

Note: As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.

How the Process Historian and Information Server work

All OS servers and OS single stations for which there is a Process Historian (PH) configured in the PCS 7 project swap out your alarms to the PH in runtime. In addition all OS archive tags identified as ""Long-term archiving"" are archived on the PH for runtime.

The Information Server (IS) is a web-based reporting system. The IS provides the user with the data from the PH database using the Internet Information Service (IIS).

The following image provides an overview of the Process Historian and Information Server mode of operation:

1. Prompt data archiving of the OS single stations and the OS server on the PH.
2. SIMATIC BATCH swaps out its batch data to the PH in the manner in which this is also available in the BATCH database (native archiving).
3. IS client access to the IS for report creation.

Note
A redundant operation of the PH is possible.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.7 Time stamp

Messages are generated in different areas and at various positions within PCS 7. The origin of the message will, therefore, affect its time stamp.

All messages are archived and are displayed in the same way, regardless of their origin. AS and I/O messages are forwarded to the OS servers separately via the plant bus. They already contain the appropriate time stamp. The OS server arranges all messages in the correct order.

To ensure that the correct time stamp is always available, you must configure time synchronization between all the components of the PCS 7 project.

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.1 Introduction

Backing up process values and messages

In a PCS 7 plant, you can archive various types of data which are produced in process mode. This data includes process values (analog and binary) and messages.

PCS 7 provides the option of automatically creating archive tags for process values that are marked accordingly. In order for this to happen, the process values must be labeled as relevant for archiving in the SIMATIC Manager using the ""Archive"" attribute. This attribute can only be set for block I/Os intended for operator control and monitoring. The available labels, ""Archiving"" and ""Long-term archiving"", specify whether the process value should also be saved for the long term if a Process Historian is used. If you have selected the ""Create archives"" option, PCS 7 then creates the labeled archive tags automatically when the ""Compile OS"" function is executed.

The recording and archiving times can be adapted to the physical type of the process tag immediately after this step in a clear display (in the SIMATIC Manager process object view, for example).

The individual process tags can be roughly divided into four classes for display purposes:

- Temperature measurement (CT) 10 s to 20 s
- Level measurement (CL) 5 s to 10 s
- Pressure measurement (CP) 3 s to 5 s
- Flow measurement (CF) 0.5 s to 3 s

Depending on how the components have been dimensioned, their values may differ from the example values given here.

By default, archiving is performed locally on the OS servers. The PCS 7 system distinguishes between archive tags which must be archived in intervals of under one minute (TagLogging Fast) and those which must be archived in intervals of over one minute (TagLogging Slow), where one minute is the default setting. The system assigns the tags to two separate archive databases accordingly in online mode. If these archive values are mixed together in the configurable ""process value archives"" or the system archive, this will not have any effect on the process of assigning them to different databases.

# 10.4 Archiving

The following figure shows the structure of the archives, which are designed as circular logs and use single segments.

The archive values associated with TagLogging Fast and also with TagLogging Slow (as of PCS 7 V7.0) are saved in the database in a compressed state, although this does not impair the quality of the values.

The compression factor which can be achieved depends on a number of factors, particularly on whether or not the archive values can be combined during the acquisition of measured values by means of a sufficiently large hysteresis setting.

Compression ensures that the size of the values will be reduced by a factor of 0.5. This results in a value that is usually around 6 bytes per measured value, but which can sometimes reach up to 16 bytes per measured value.

A message with the maximum number of associated values and comments requires 4 KB. The minimum value for a message is 172 bytes.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

# Archive settings

The system always offers two criteria for specifying the archive size of a single segment and
the overall size of the circular log:

- Definition of a time period
- Physical size in bytes

If one of these two criteria is exceeded, this will lead to a switch to the next segment in the
case of a single segment, or to the overwriting of the first segment of the entire circular log.
As the total hard disk capacity available for archiving is predefined, the specification in bytes
is the only criterion which is relevant for the entire circular log.

This specification must be standardized for all three archive databases (TagLogging Fast,
TagLogging Slow, and AlarmLogging) in line with the available hard disk capacity.
A time period during which the Tag Logging should be referred back to is set in the practical
implementation. The required memory is roughly calculated.

When using a Process Historian (PH), we also recommend saving the time range required
for the operator in the process mode of typically 1 to 3 months on the OS servers.

# 10.4.2 Archive configuration for TagLogging Fast and TagLogging Slow

# Calculation

Calculation of the memory requirements of all segments for a specified period of y months
for TagLogging Fast:

To perform this calculation, you will need to know how many archive values are saved per
second on average. The archive variables are displayed in a clear form in the process object
view of the SIMATIC Manager. The average archive load can be determined using the
memory cycle of the variables.

The memory requirements for x bytes are generally calculated as follows:

number of archive values/s * x bytes * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y
months

A specification comprising days or weeks is usually used for a single segment. A segment
change faster than one day may not be used, as this would make the number of segments to
be connected to the MS SQL database when the OS server starts up too large, thus
impairing performance.

Note

As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and
AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.
The maximum size of a single segment should not exceed 700MB (up to PCS 7 V8.0) or
2GB (from PCS 7 V8.1).
The size of a single segment in bytes can also be calculated using the definition provided
above. It is not the decisive criterion, but it does need to be checked.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

Example

You are planning on using a period of around 2 months: You have calculated a mean value of 750 archive values/s for TagLogging Fast.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 60 GB

(750 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 22 GB

(750 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 30 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Fast"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

You proceed in exactly the same way for ""TagLogging Slow"". You have calculated a mean value of 100 archive values/s for TagLogging Slow.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 8 GB (100 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 3 GB (100 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 5 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Slow"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.3 Archive configuration for AlarmLogging

Calculation

Unlike with TagLogging, messages occur as events and you must make assumptions, for example, as regards an average message load which is continuously present. These assumptions can differ from one another considerably, depending on the technology/sector in question.

In practice, however, you can also proceed in another way, by calculating the TagLogging requirement and adding the available, unused hard disk memory space to the AlarmLogging database. This would then become the specification for the maximum size of all segments.

The memory requirements are generally calculated as follows:

Number of messages/s * 4 KB/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y months

# Example

You assume that the number of events in your plant is 1 message/s.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows: approx. 20 GB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- The following is calculated for a single segment per day: approx. 330 MB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 1 day)

Deliberately set this limit higher so that you can still achieve a daily swap-out even if a message burst occurs. In our example, we have selected 700 MB.

Note: As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.7 Time stamp

Messages are generated in different areas and at various positions within PCS 7. The origin of the message will, therefore, affect its time stamp.

All messages are archived and are displayed in the same way, regardless of their origin. AS and I/O messages are forwarded to the OS servers separately via the plant bus. They already contain the appropriate time stamp. The OS server arranges all messages in the correct order.

To ensure that the correct time stamp is always available, you must configure time synchronization between all the components of the PCS 7 project.

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.1 Introduction

Backing up process values and messages

In a PCS 7 plant, you can archive various types of data which are produced in process mode. This data includes process values (analog and binary) and messages.

PCS 7 provides the option of automatically creating archive tags for process values that are marked accordingly. In order for this to happen, the process values must be labeled as relevant for archiving in the SIMATIC Manager using the ""Archive"" attribute. This attribute can only be set for block I/Os intended for operator control and monitoring. The available labels, ""Archiving"" and ""Long-term archiving"", specify whether the process value should also be saved for the long term if a Process Historian is used. If you have selected the ""Create archives"" option, PCS 7 then creates the labeled archive tags automatically when the ""Compile OS"" function is executed.

The recording and archiving times can be adapted to the physical type of the process tag immediately after this step in a clear display (in the SIMATIC Manager process object view, for example).

The individual process tags can be roughly divided into four classes for display purposes:

- Temperature measurement (CT) 10 s to 20 s
- Level measurement (CL) 5 s to 10 s
- Pressure measurement (CP) 3 s to 5 s
- Flow measurement (CF) 0.5 s to 3 s

Depending on how the components have been dimensioned, their values may differ from the example values given here.

By default, archiving is performed locally on the OS servers. The PCS 7 system distinguishes between archive tags which must be archived in intervals of under one minute (TagLogging Fast) and those which must be archived in intervals of over one minute (TagLogging Slow), where one minute is the default setting. The system assigns the tags to two separate archive databases accordingly in online mode. If these archive values are mixed together in the configurable ""process value archives"" or the system archive, this will not have any effect on the process of assigning them to different databases.

# 10.4 Archiving

The following figure shows the structure of the archives, which are designed as circular logs and use single segments.

The archive values associated with TagLogging Fast and also with TagLogging Slow (as of PCS 7 V7.0) are saved in the database in a compressed state, although this does not impair the quality of the values.

The compression factor which can be achieved depends on a number of factors, particularly on whether or not the archive values can be combined during the acquisition of measured values by means of a sufficiently large hysteresis setting.

Compression ensures that the size of the values will be reduced by a factor of 0.5. This results in a value that is usually around 6 bytes per measured value, but which can sometimes reach up to 16 bytes per measured value.

A message with the maximum number of associated values and comments requires 4 KB. The minimum value for a message is 172 bytes.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

# Archive settings

The system always offers two criteria for specifying the archive size of a single segment and
the overall size of the circular log:

- Definition of a time period
- Physical size in bytes

If one of these two criteria is exceeded, this will lead to a switch to the next segment in the
case of a single segment, or to the overwriting of the first segment of the entire circular log.
As the total hard disk capacity available for archiving is predefined, the specification in bytes
is the only criterion which is relevant for the entire circular log.

This specification must be standardized for all three archive databases (TagLogging Fast,
TagLogging Slow, and AlarmLogging) in line with the available hard disk capacity.
A time period during which the Tag Logging should be referred back to is set in the practical
implementation. The required memory is roughly calculated.

When using a Process Historian (PH), we also recommend saving the time range required
for the operator in the process mode of typically 1 to 3 months on the OS servers.

# 10.4.2 Archive configuration for TagLogging Fast and TagLogging Slow

# Calculation

Calculation of the memory requirements of all segments for a specified period of y months
for TagLogging Fast:

To perform this calculation, you will need to know how many archive values are saved per
second on average. The archive variables are displayed in a clear form in the process object
view of the SIMATIC Manager. The average archive load can be determined using the
memory cycle of the variables.

The memory requirements for x bytes are generally calculated as follows:

number of archive values/s * x bytes * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y
months

A specification comprising days or weeks is usually used for a single segment. A segment
change faster than one day may not be used, as this would make the number of segments to
be connected to the MS SQL database when the OS server starts up too large, thus
impairing performance.

Note

As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and
AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.
The maximum size of a single segment should not exceed 700MB (up to PCS 7 V8.0) or
2GB (from PCS 7 V8.1).
The size of a single segment in bytes can also be calculated using the definition provided
above. It is not the decisive criterion, but it does need to be checked.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

Example

You are planning on using a period of around 2 months: You have calculated a mean value of 750 archive values/s for TagLogging Fast.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 60 GB

(750 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 22 GB

(750 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 30 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Fast"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

You proceed in exactly the same way for ""TagLogging Slow"". You have calculated a mean value of 100 archive values/s for TagLogging Slow.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 8 GB (100 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 3 GB (100 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 5 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Slow"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.3 Archive configuration for AlarmLogging

Calculation

Unlike with TagLogging, messages occur as events and you must make assumptions, for example, as regards an average message load which is continuously present. These assumptions can differ from one another considerably, depending on the technology/sector in question.

In practice, however, you can also proceed in another way, by calculating the TagLogging requirement and adding the available, unused hard disk memory space to the AlarmLogging database. This would then become the specification for the maximum size of all segments.

The memory requirements are generally calculated as follows:

Number of messages/s * 4 KB/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y months

# Example

You assume that the number of events in your plant is 1 message/s.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows: approx. 20 GB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- The following is calculated for a single segment per day: approx. 330 MB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 1 day)

Deliberately set this limit higher so that you can still achieve a daily swap-out even if a message burst occurs. In our example, we have selected 700 MB.

Note: As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.

How the Process Historian and Information Server work

All OS servers and OS single stations for which there is a Process Historian (PH) configured in the PCS 7 project swap out your alarms to the PH in runtime. In addition all OS archive tags identified as ""Long-term archiving"" are archived on the PH for runtime.

The Information Server (IS) is a web-based reporting system. The IS provides the user with the data from the PH database using the Internet Information Service (IIS).

The following image provides an overview of the Process Historian and Information Server mode of operation:

1. Prompt data archiving of the OS single stations and the OS server on the PH.
2. SIMATIC BATCH swaps out its batch data to the PH in the manner in which this is also available in the BATCH database (native archiving).

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.7 Time stamp

Messages are generated in different areas and at various positions within PCS 7. The origin of the message will, therefore, affect its time stamp.

All messages are archived and are displayed in the same way, regardless of their origin. AS and I/O messages are forwarded to the OS servers separately via the plant bus. They already contain the appropriate time stamp. The OS server arranges all messages in the correct order.

To ensure that the correct time stamp is always available, you must configure time synchronization between all the components of the PCS 7 project.

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.1 Introduction

Backing up process values and messages

In a PCS 7 plant, you can archive various types of data which are produced in process mode. This data includes process values (analog and binary) and messages.

PCS 7 provides the option of automatically creating archive tags for process values that are marked accordingly. In order for this to happen, the process values must be labeled as relevant for archiving in the SIMATIC Manager using the ""Archive"" attribute. This attribute can only be set for block I/Os intended for operator control and monitoring. The available labels, ""Archiving"" and ""Long-term archiving"", specify whether the process value should also be saved for the long term if a Process Historian is used. If you have selected the ""Create archives"" option, PCS 7 then creates the labeled archive tags automatically when the ""Compile OS"" function is executed.

The recording and archiving times can be adapted to the physical type of the process tag immediately after this step in a clear display (in the SIMATIC Manager process object view, for example).

The individual process tags can be roughly divided into four classes for display purposes:

- Temperature measurement (CT) 10 s to 20 s
- Level measurement (CL) 5 s to 10 s
- Pressure measurement (CP) 3 s to 5 s
- Flow measurement (CF) 0.5 s to 3 s

Depending on how the components have been dimensioned, their values may differ from the example values given here.

By default, archiving is performed locally on the OS servers. The PCS 7 system distinguishes between archive tags which must be archived in intervals of under one minute (TagLogging Fast) and those which must be archived in intervals of over one minute (TagLogging Slow), where one minute is the default setting. The system assigns the tags to two separate archive databases accordingly in online mode. If these archive values are mixed together in the configurable ""process value archives"" or the system archive, this will not have any effect on the process of assigning them to different databases.

# 10.4 Archiving

The following figure shows the structure of the archives, which are designed as circular logs and use single segments.

The archive values associated with TagLogging Fast and also with TagLogging Slow (as of PCS 7 V7.0) are saved in the database in a compressed state, although this does not impair the quality of the values.

The compression factor which can be achieved depends on a number of factors, particularly on whether or not the archive values can be combined during the acquisition of measured values by means of a sufficiently large hysteresis setting.

Compression ensures that the size of the values will be reduced by a factor of 0.5. This results in a value that is usually around 6 bytes per measured value, but which can sometimes reach up to 16 bytes per measured value.

A message with the maximum number of associated values and comments requires 4 KB. The minimum value for a message is 172 bytes.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

# Archive settings

The system always offers two criteria for specifying the archive size of a single segment and
the overall size of the circular log:

- Definition of a time period
- Physical size in bytes

If one of these two criteria is exceeded, this will lead to a switch to the next segment in the
case of a single segment, or to the overwriting of the first segment of the entire circular log.
As the total hard disk capacity available for archiving is predefined, the specification in bytes
is the only criterion which is relevant for the entire circular log.

This specification must be standardized for all three archive databases (TagLogging Fast,
TagLogging Slow, and AlarmLogging) in line with the available hard disk capacity.
A time period during which the Tag Logging should be referred back to is set in the practical
implementation. The required memory is roughly calculated.

When using a Process Historian (PH), we also recommend saving the time range required
for the operator in the process mode of typically 1 to 3 months on the OS servers.

# 10.4.2 Archive configuration for TagLogging Fast and TagLogging Slow

# Calculation

Calculation of the memory requirements of all segments for a specified period of y months
for TagLogging Fast:

To perform this calculation, you will need to know how many archive values are saved per
second on average. The archive variables are displayed in a clear form in the process object
view of the SIMATIC Manager. The average archive load can be determined using the
memory cycle of the variables.

The memory requirements for x bytes are generally calculated as follows:

number of archive values/s * x bytes * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y
months

A specification comprising days or weeks is usually used for a single segment. A segment
change faster than one day may not be used, as this would make the number of segments to
be connected to the MS SQL database when the OS server starts up too large, thus
impairing performance.

Note

As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and
AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.
The maximum size of a single segment should not exceed 700MB (up to PCS 7 V8.0) or
2GB (from PCS 7 V8.1).
The size of a single segment in bytes can also be calculated using the definition provided
above. It is not the decisive criterion, but it does need to be checked.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

Example

You are planning on using a period of around 2 months: You have calculated a mean value of 750 archive values/s for TagLogging Fast.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 60 GB

(750 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 22 GB

(750 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 30 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Fast"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

You proceed in exactly the same way for ""TagLogging Slow"". You have calculated a mean value of 100 archive values/s for TagLogging Slow.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 8 GB (100 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 3 GB (100 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 5 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Slow"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.3 Archive configuration for AlarmLogging

Calculation

Unlike with TagLogging, messages occur as events and you must make assumptions, for example, as regards an average message load which is continuously present. These assumptions can differ from one another considerably, depending on the technology/sector in question.

In practice, however, you can also proceed in another way, by calculating the TagLogging requirement and adding the available, unused hard disk memory space to the AlarmLogging database. This would then become the specification for the maximum size of all segments.

The memory requirements are generally calculated as follows:

Number of messages/s * 4 KB/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y months

# Example

You assume that the number of events in your plant is 1 message/s.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows: approx. 20 GB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- The following is calculated for a single segment per day: approx. 330 MB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 1 day)

Deliberately set this limit higher so that you can still achieve a daily swap-out even if a message burst occurs. In our example, we have selected 700 MB.

Note: As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.

How the Process Historian and Information Server work

All OS servers and OS single stations for which there is a Process Historian (PH) configured in the PCS 7 project swap out your alarms to the PH in runtime. In addition all OS archive tags identified as ""Long-term archiving"" are archived on the PH for runtime.

The Information Server (IS) is a web-based reporting system. The IS provides the user with the data from the PH database using the Internet Information Service (IIS).

The following image provides an overview of the Process Historian and Information Server mode of operation:

1. Prompt data archiving of the OS single stations and the OS server on the PH.
2. SIMATIC BATCH swaps out its batch data to the PH in the manner in which this is also available in the BATCH database (native archiving).

Introduction

The Process Historian (PH) is used to archive process values, messages and batch data of the SIMATIC PCS 7 process control system. The process values and messages managed in the PH database can be displayed on OS clients and OS single stations clearly and graphically (with WinCC Alarm or WinCC Trend Control).

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.7 Time stamp

Messages are generated in different areas and at various positions within PCS 7. The origin of the message will, therefore, affect its time stamp.

All messages are archived and are displayed in the same way, regardless of their origin. AS and I/O messages are forwarded to the OS servers separately via the plant bus. They already contain the appropriate time stamp. The OS server arranges all messages in the correct order.

To ensure that the correct time stamp is always available, you must configure time synchronization between all the components of the PCS 7 project.

|Origin|Configuration of the message text|Time stamp place of origin|Meaning in PCS 7|
|---|---|---|---|
|Operator station (OS)|In OS ""alarm logging""|In the OS|OS system messages|
|Automation system (AS)|In the instances of the function block (e.g. CTRL_PID or MEAS_MON)|In the AS|Process messages and AS system messages from the SIMATIC station|

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.1 Introduction

Backing up process values and messages

In a PCS 7 plant, you can archive various types of data which are produced in process mode. This data includes process values (analog and binary) and messages.

PCS 7 provides the option of automatically creating archive tags for process values that are marked accordingly. In order for this to happen, the process values must be labeled as relevant for archiving in the SIMATIC Manager using the ""Archive"" attribute. This attribute can only be set for block I/Os intended for operator control and monitoring. The available labels, ""Archiving"" and ""Long-term archiving"", specify whether the process value should also be saved for the long term if a Process Historian is used. If you have selected the ""Create archives"" option, PCS 7 then creates the labeled archive tags automatically when the ""Compile OS"" function is executed.

The recording and archiving times can be adapted to the physical type of the process tag immediately after this step in a clear display (in the SIMATIC Manager process object view, for example).

The individual process tags can be roughly divided into four classes for display purposes:

- Temperature measurement (CT) 10 s to 20 s
- Level measurement (CL) 5 s to 10 s
- Pressure measurement (CP) 3 s to 5 s
- Flow measurement (CF) 0.5 s to 3 s

Depending on how the components have been dimensioned, their values may differ from the example values given here.

By default, archiving is performed locally on the OS servers. The PCS 7 system distinguishes between archive tags which must be archived in intervals of under one minute (TagLogging Fast) and those which must be archived in intervals of over one minute (TagLogging Slow), where one minute is the default setting. The system assigns the tags to two separate archive databases accordingly in online mode. If these archive values are mixed together in the configurable ""process value archives"" or the system archive, this will not have any effect on the process of assigning them to different databases.

# 10.4 Archiving

The following figure shows the structure of the archives, which are designed as circular logs and use single segments.

The archive values associated with TagLogging Fast and also with TagLogging Slow (as of PCS 7 V7.0) are saved in the database in a compressed state, although this does not impair the quality of the values.

The compression factor which can be achieved depends on a number of factors, particularly on whether or not the archive values can be combined during the acquisition of measured values by means of a sufficiently large hysteresis setting.

Compression ensures that the size of the values will be reduced by a factor of 0.5. This results in a value that is usually around 6 bytes per measured value, but which can sometimes reach up to 16 bytes per measured value.

A message with the maximum number of associated values and comments requires 4 KB. The minimum value for a message is 172 bytes.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

# Archive settings

The system always offers two criteria for specifying the archive size of a single segment and
the overall size of the circular log:

- Definition of a time period
- Physical size in bytes

If one of these two criteria is exceeded, this will lead to a switch to the next segment in the
case of a single segment, or to the overwriting of the first segment of the entire circular log.
As the total hard disk capacity available for archiving is predefined, the specification in bytes
is the only criterion which is relevant for the entire circular log.

This specification must be standardized for all three archive databases (TagLogging Fast,
TagLogging Slow, and AlarmLogging) in line with the available hard disk capacity.
A time period during which the Tag Logging should be referred back to is set in the practical
implementation. The required memory is roughly calculated.

When using a Process Historian (PH), we also recommend saving the time range required
for the operator in the process mode of typically 1 to 3 months on the OS servers.

# 10.4.2 Archive configuration for TagLogging Fast and TagLogging Slow

# Calculation

Calculation of the memory requirements of all segments for a specified period of y months
for TagLogging Fast:

To perform this calculation, you will need to know how many archive values are saved per
second on average. The archive variables are displayed in a clear form in the process object
view of the SIMATIC Manager. The average archive load can be determined using the
memory cycle of the variables.

The memory requirements for x bytes are generally calculated as follows:

number of archive values/s * x bytes * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y
months

A specification comprising days or weeks is usually used for a single segment. A segment
change faster than one day may not be used, as this would make the number of segments to
be connected to the MS SQL database when the OS server starts up too large, thus
impairing performance.

Note

As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and
AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.
The maximum size of a single segment should not exceed 700MB (up to PCS 7 V8.0) or
2GB (from PCS 7 V8.1).
The size of a single segment in bytes can also be calculated using the definition provided
above. It is not the decisive criterion, but it does need to be checked.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

Example

You are planning on using a period of around 2 months: You have calculated a mean value of 750 archive values/s for TagLogging Fast.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 60 GB

(750 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 22 GB

(750 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 30 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Fast"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

You proceed in exactly the same way for ""TagLogging Slow"". You have calculated a mean value of 100 archive values/s for TagLogging Slow.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 8 GB (100 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 3 GB (100 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 5 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the ""TagLogging Slow"" configuration of the ""TagLogging"" editor:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.3 Archive configuration for AlarmLogging

Calculation

Unlike with TagLogging, messages occur as events and you must make assumptions, for example, as regards an average message load which is continuously present. These assumptions can differ from one another considerably, depending on the technology/sector in question.

In practice, however, you can also proceed in another way, by calculating the TagLogging requirement and adding the available, unused hard disk memory space to the AlarmLogging database. This would then become the specification for the maximum size of all segments.

The memory requirements are generally calculated as follows:

Number of messages/s * 4 KB/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y months

# Example

You assume that the number of events in your plant is 1 message/s.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows: approx. 20 GB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- The following is calculated for a single segment per day: approx. 330 MB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 1 day)

Deliberately set this limit higher so that you can still achieve a daily swap-out even if a message burst occurs. In our example, we have selected 700 MB.

Note: As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.

How the Process Historian and Information Server work

All OS servers and OS single stations for which there is a Process Historian (PH) configured in the PCS 7 project swap out your alarms to the PH in runtime. In addition all OS archive tags identified as ""Long-term archiving"" are archived on the PH for runtime.

The Information Server (IS) is a web-based reporting system. The IS provides the user with the data from the PH database using the Internet Information Service (IIS).

The following image provides an overview of the Process Historian and Information Server mode of operation:

1. Prompt data archiving of the OS single stations and the OS server on the PH.
2. SIMATIC BATCH swaps out its batch data to the PH in the manner in which this is also available in the BATCH database (native archiving).
3. IS client access to the IS for report creation.

Note
A redundant operation of the PH is possible.

The Process Historian (PH) is used to archive process values, messages and batch data of the SIMATIC PCS 7 process control system. The process values and messages managed in the PH database can be displayed on OS clients and OS single stations clearly and graphically (with WinCC Alarm or WinCC Trend Control). ",How is the memory requirement calculated for TagLogging Fast in PCS 7 as per the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,"The memory requirement for TagLogging Fast is calculated by multiplying the number of archive values per second by bytes per value, then by time constants for the specified period.","To calculate TagLogging Fast memory needs in PCS 7, multiply archive values per second by bytes per value and time factors over the desired months.","Calculating TagLogging Fast memory in PCS 7 involves archive values per second, bytes per value, and time multipliers for the target duration.","Memory for TagLogging Fast in PCS 7 is determined by archive values per second times bytes per value, extended over time for the planned period.","In PCS 7, TagLogging Fast memory calculation is based on archive values per second, bytes per value, and cumulative time factors for the specified months."
