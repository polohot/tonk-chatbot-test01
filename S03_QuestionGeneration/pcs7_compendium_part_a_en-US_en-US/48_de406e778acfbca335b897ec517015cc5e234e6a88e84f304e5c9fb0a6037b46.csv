# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Making the AS assignment

The object properties of a hierarchy folder play an important role in this regard. Using the
""reactor1"" folder as an example: On the ""AS-OS Assignment"" tab, assign the ""reactor1""
folder an automation system as a technical plant from the component view. In this case the
charts from station ""AS1_H"" are assigned.

Each hierarchy folder then has an AS assigned as a technical plant, unit, or function in which
the charts run after being downloaded. All elements which you add to the hierarchy folder will
be assigned to this AS. If you transfer the selected assignments to lower-level objects, the
subordinate hierarchy folders adopt the same AS assignment. You can recognize this by the note
""All lower-level objects have the selected assignment.""

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.7 Sharing out configuration work

# Introduction

Engineering management within a multiproject without any division of labor is a standard practice. However, if the goal is to shorten the configuration time by working in parallel, as of PCS 7 Version 7.0 SP1 the question of the most suitable method arises, because multi-user engineering has now been introduced as well as multiproject engineering.

# Multiproject engineering

For fast and flexible AS configuration, individual projects can be divided among distributed engineering stations. PCS 7 offers the appropriate system functions for managing, distributing and merging the projects. Projects can be separated from the multiproject in order for them to be processed on other engineering stations, e.g. in an office environment. Once they have been processed these projects are reintegrated into the central multiproject of the plant.

# 5.7 Sharing out configuration work

# Introduction

Engineering management within a multiproject without any division of labor is a standard practice. However, if the goal is to shorten the configuration time by working in parallel, as of PCS 7 Version 7.0 SP1 the question of the most suitable method arises, because multi-user engineering has now been introduced as well as multiproject engineering.

# Multiproject engineering

For fast and flexible AS configuration, individual projects can be divided among distributed engineering stations. PCS 7 offers the appropriate system functions for managing, distributing and merging the projects. Projects can be separated from the multiproject in order for them to be processed on other engineering stations, e.g. in an office environment. Once they have been processed these projects are reintegrated into the central multiproject of the plant.

# Multi-user engineering

In addition to multiproject engineering, PCS 7 as of Version 7.0 SP1 also offers the possibility of working parallel on the same user program (CFC/SFC of an AS project). In this case the specific project can remain at its storage location. ",What is the significance of making the OS assignment for a hierarchy folder in PCS 7?,"It is necessary before adding process pictures, as all elements added to the folder will be assigned to this OS.",OS assignment must be completed prior to process picture addition to ensure all folder elements are correctly assigned.,"Before process pictures can be added, the hierarchy folder requires an OS assignment to assign all subsequent elements.",Making the OS assignment early ensures that all future additions to the folder are automatically linked to the correct OS.,"This step is crucial for organizing process pictures, as it dictates the OS to which all folder elements will be assigned."

The ""Derive picture hierarchy from the plant hierarchy"" setting is activated by default in PCS 7. The advantage of this is that the OS picture hierarchy is fully derived from the configured PH during OS compilation and does not have to be configured and maintained separately.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Making the AS assignment

The object properties of a hierarchy folder play an important role in this regard. Using the
""reactor1"" folder as an example: On the ""AS-OS Assignment"" tab, assign the ""reactor1""
folder an automation system as a technical plant from the component view. In this case the
charts from station ""AS1_H"" are assigned.

Each hierarchy folder then has an AS assigned as a technical plant, unit, or function in which
the charts run after being downloaded. All elements which you add to the hierarchy folder will
be assigned to this AS. If you transfer the selected assignments to lower-level objects, the
subordinate hierarchy folders adopt the same AS assignment. You can recognize this by the note
""All lower-level objects have the selected assignment.""

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Making the OS assignment

You need to make the OS assignment for the hierarchy folder before you can add process pictures.

All elements which you add to the hierarchy folder will be assigned to this OS. If you transfer the selected assignments to lower-level objects, the subordinate hierarchy folders adopt the same OS assignment.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Checking the consistency of the PH

We recommend that you check the consistency of the plant hierarchy each time you have edited it. For this right-click on the multiproject and select the ""Plant Hierarchy > Check Consistency"" command in the context menu.

The screenshot below illustrates a naming conflict relating to CFC charts which are in different AS programs, but the same multiproject.

In the check log, all objects are displayed with their symbol, project name, and, if they exist, the paths of the plant view and the component view.

Note

We recommend that the consistency check always be performed for the entire multiproject, which will entail additional checks.

Additional information on this is available in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual or via the Help button in the log.

You can display the log without running the check again, via ""Options > Plant Hierarchy > Open Check Log"" command.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.7 Sharing out configuration work

# Introduction

Engineering management within a multiproject without any division of labor is a standard practice. However, if the goal is to shorten the configuration time by working in parallel, as of PCS 7 Version 7.0 SP1 the question of the most suitable method arises, because multi-user engineering has now been introduced as well as multiproject engineering.

# Multiproject engineering

For fast and flexible AS configuration, individual projects can be divided among distributed engineering stations. PCS 7 offers the appropriate system functions for managing, distributing and merging the projects. Projects can be separated from the multiproject in order for them to be processed on other engineering stations, e.g. in an office environment. Once they have been processed these projects are reintegrated into the central multiproject of the plant.

# Multi-user engineering

In addition to multiproject engineering, PCS 7 as of Version 7.0 SP1 also offers the possibility of working parallel on the same user program (CFC/SFC of an AS project). In this case the specific project can remain at its storage location.
