# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

When the assignment has been successfully performed, the result can also be seen in the OS client project in the WinCC Explorer under ""Server data"".

Note

The server data includes the computer name of the ES from which the server data is to be downloaded automatically. If the ES cannot be reached, the OS client attempts to download the server data directly from the server when runtime is restarted.

If the project is moved to another path or to another ES (another computer name), the server data must be regenerated (manually or by compiling the OS) and reassigned to the OS client projects.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

The information contained in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog originates from server data, which was assigned to the corresponding OS client.

Example

CLIENT01, CLIENT02 &gt; assigned to SERVER1A

CLIENT03, CLIENT04 &gt; assigned to SERVER1B

# Allocation of OS clients

Referenced OS clients are automatically assigned to the same preferred server by the assigned basis OS client. A different assignment is not possible.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.3 Selecting and configuring a standard server

Introduction

You configure a standard server for a client in a distributed system to:

- Receive messages and alarms
- Make the user-configured message classes available on a client
- Create operator messages on the client
- Make trend groups assembled on a client available to other clients
- Have access to user archives

A standard server setting is required on each client.

Note

Selected standard servers (e.g. ",How are referenced OS clients assigned to a preferred server in the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,They are automatically assigned to the same preferred server as the basis OS client they reference.,Referenced OS clients inherit the preferred server assignment from their basis OS client.,"Assignment is automatic, matching the preferred server of the referenced basis OS client.",They follow the preferred server setting of the basis OS client they are referenced to.,Automatically aligned with the preferred server of their associated basis OS client.

Note

OS server data only has to be assigned once to the OS client project. The client is automatically provided with the new OS server data when an OS server is downloaded (complete or changes only). An update is also performed when the OS client starts process mode.
