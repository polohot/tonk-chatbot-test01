# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.
