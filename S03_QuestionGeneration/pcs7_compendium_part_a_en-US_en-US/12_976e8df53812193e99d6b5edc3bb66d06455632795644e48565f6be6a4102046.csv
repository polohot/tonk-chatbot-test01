# 4.3.2 Hard disk distribution

# Introduction

The following chart shows an example of how a PC station hard disk can be distributed:

|drive|Name|Size|Format|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|C:|SYSTEM|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|Installation of Operat- ing System and PCS 7|
|D:|DATA|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|PCS 7 project data|
|I:|IMAGES|Optional|NTFS|Backup files (including potentially via the network)|

Note

The Microsoft SQL Server stores temporary files on the ""C:"" drive. Therefore, you should regularly check whether enough hard disk space is available, especially during the FAT. You can find additional information on the hard disk distribution in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Internet time

Ensure that the Windows system time is not automatically synchronized via the Internet where the PC stations are operated in a workgroup (Change date/time &gt; Internet time). ",What are the recommended security measures for operator stations in PCS 7 systems?,"Change the existing default passwords, deactivate unneeded floppy disk, CD or DVD drives, deactivate USB port functions not required, and deactivate the boot menu display setting the hard disk with system partition at the initial position of the boot sequence.","For operator stations, it's advised to change default passwords, disable unnecessary drives like floppy, CD, or DVD, turn off unused USB ports, and adjust the boot sequence to prioritize the system partition hard disk.","Security measures include updating default passwords, removing access to unnecessary drives (floppy, CD, DVD), disabling non-essential USB ports, and configuring the boot sequence to start from the system partition hard disk.","To secure operator stations, one should alter default passwords, deactivate drives not in use (such as floppy, CD, or DVD), shut down unnecessary USB functionalities, and ensure the boot sequence begins with the system partition hard disk.","Key security steps involve changing default passwords, disabling superfluous drives (floppy, CD, DVD) and USB ports, and setting the hard disk with the system partition to boot first."

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Internet time

Ensure that the Windows system time is not automatically synchronized via the Internet where the PC stations are operated in a workgroup (Change date/time &gt; Internet time).

# 4.3.2 Hard disk distribution

# Introduction

The following chart shows an example of how a PC station hard disk can be distributed:

|drive|Name|Size|Format|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|C:|SYSTEM|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|Installation of Operat- ing System and PCS 7|
|D:|DATA|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|PCS 7 project data|
|I:|IMAGES|Optional|NTFS|Backup files (including potentially via the network)|

Note

The Microsoft SQL Server stores temporary files on the ""C:"" drive. Therefore, you should regularly check whether enough hard disk space is available, especially during the FAT. You can find additional information on the hard disk distribution in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.
