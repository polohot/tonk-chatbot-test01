# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

For this open the ""Create/Update Block Icons"" dialog box via the ""Plant hierarchy"" context menu in the plant hierarchy. This dialog box has an option for adapting the structure of the process tag name (TAG) and for determining the number of lower levels that are taken into account in creating or updating the block icons.

The following image shows the ""Create/Update Block Icons"" dialog box.

The PCS 7 picture blocks are implemented as a change function when the OS is compiled or with the ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function. The associated picture is updated when a change is made in the CFC chart. All block icons of a picture are updated for all other changes.

E.g. if one of the ""@PCS7Typicals*.pdl"" or ""@PCS7TypicalsXYZ.pdl"" template pictures changes, all plant pictures are updated.

Note

With the ""Zoom block icons"" option, you can proportionally scale the block icons and thus adjust them to the right size for the screen resolution. If the ""Automatically place block icons"" option is activated, all automatically generated block icons in the WinCC images are placed once more (from top left to bottom right).

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.
