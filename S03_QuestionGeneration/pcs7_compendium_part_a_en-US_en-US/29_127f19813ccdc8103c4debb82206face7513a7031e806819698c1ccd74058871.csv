# Backups

Images are often created when PCs are installed in order to have restore points on the one hand in the event that faults occur later on in the installation, and so that any reinstallation can be completed more efficiently on the other.

This section describes how to create a PCS 7 project as a so-called multiproject on the Engineering Station (ES). The description is based on the hardware architecture established in the previous section:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.1 General configuration rules

# Introduction

Before you create your own multiproject, you should be familiar with these important rules. This will help you to avoid carrying out certain tasks twice.

# Central configuration

The entire configuration is performed on the ES in PCS 7 before the OS projects are loaded to the respective PCs.

Note

You can find information about distributing the configuration work across multiple engineering stations in the ""Sharing out configuration work (Page 86)"" section.

# Archiving

Do not forget to archive the overall project along with the individual projects on a regular basis via the SIMATIC Manager, especially where it is being worked on by multiple individuals.

Note

From PCS 7 V8.1, the ""auto-archiving"" function is available when downloading the program (with the optional package version trail).

# Master data library

Use a uniform master data library for the complete multiproject and ensure that all configuring engineers use the blocks, CMTs (control module types) and process tag types from this library.

# Multilingual capability

SIMATIC PCS 7 provides a large number of settings for texts and languages. The following application example provides a detailed description of how these are correctly configured, adapted, or amended:

# Master data library

Use a uniform master data library for the complete multiproject and ensure that all configuring engineers use the blocks, CMTs (control module types) and process tag types from this library.

# Multilingual capability

SIMATIC PCS 7 provides a large number of settings for texts and languages. The following application example provides a detailed description of how these are correctly configured, adapted, or amended:

# 5.1 General configuration rules

# Time synchronization

Time synchronization is critically important for the interrupt and tag logging system. Make sure that only one (redundant) time server is active in the running system and that all stations (PCs and CPUs) use the correct time. In PCS 7 V7.0 and above the CPU always uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

For information on time synchronization see the following manuals:

- ""PCS 7 time synchronization""
- ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station""

# Backups

Images are often created when PCs are installed in order to have restore points on the one hand in the event that faults occur later on in the installation, and so that any reinstallation can be completed more efficiently on the other.

Attention must be paid to the following points when managing images:

- Secure storage location
- Detailed description for each image

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

This section describes how to create a PCS 7 project as a so-called multiproject on the Engineering Station (ES). The description is based on the hardware architecture established in the previous section:

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.1 General configuration rules

# Introduction

Before you create your own multiproject, you should be familiar with these important rules. This will help you to avoid carrying out certain tasks twice.

# Central configuration

The entire configuration is performed on the ES in PCS 7 before the OS projects are loaded to the respective PCs.

Note

You can find information about distributing the configuration work across multiple engineering stations in the ""Sharing out configuration work (Page 86)"" section.

# Archiving

Do not forget to archive the overall project along with the individual projects on a regular basis via the SIMATIC Manager, especially where it is being worked on by multiple individuals.

Note

From PCS 7 V8.1, the ""auto-archiving"" function is available when downloading the program (with the optional package version trail).
