# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.5 Group display

A particular message from a process picture can be traced across all levels using the group display. The overview area forms the highest level. In this overview, the operator can view messages for every area in a group display.

The messages are only valid in the relevant area. The group displays for an area are linked on a local level by means of a logical OR function and encompass all lower hierarchy levels.

You can branch from the group display (when a newly received, flashing message is present) to the picture tree at just the click of a mouse. The function branches down to the process picture, in which the message can be uniquely assigned. If messages occur in two process pictures at the same time and these pictures are ""ORed"", the function branches to the first process picture in which the group displays come together.

The group display can contain the following information:

|A|Flashing interrupt signal|(white on red)|
|---|---|---|
|W|Flashing warning|(black on yellow)|
|T|Tolerance|(white on blue, not flashing)|
|S|Flashing error message|(yellow on black)|
|O|Operator request|(white on blue, not flashing)|
|X|Message lock active in the area|(white on gray)|

- Smart Alarm Hiding
This function enables interrupts to be hidden automatically in accordance with definable plant states in order to reduce the volume of message traffic in process mode. The advantage of this method is that hidden messages are still archived. The procedure is based on grouping together messages, which, in accordance with the ""STATEREP"" CFC blocks (PCS 7 Library) and ""STRep"" (PCS 7 APL), are then assigned to the plant states to be defined. Messages can also be hidden manually.

You can display hidden messages via the ""List of hidden messages"" and ""List of messages to be hidden"" message pages.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.5 Group display

A particular message from a process picture can be traced across all levels using the group display. The overview area forms the highest level. In this overview, the operator can view messages for every area in a group display.

The messages are only valid in the relevant area. The group displays for an area are linked on a local level by means of a logical OR function and encompass all lower hierarchy levels.

You can branch from the group display (when a newly received, flashing message is present) to the picture tree at just the click of a mouse. The function branches down to the process picture, in which the message can be uniquely assigned. If messages occur in two process pictures at the same time and these pictures are ""ORed"", the function branches to the first process picture in which the group displays come together.

The group display can contain the following information:

|A|Flashing interrupt signal|(white on red)|
|---|---|---|
|W|Flashing warning|(black on yellow)|
|T|Tolerance|(white on blue, not flashing)|
|S|Flashing error message|(yellow on black)|
|O|Operator request|(white on blue, not flashing)|
|X|Message lock active in the area|(white on gray)|

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.6 Audible interrupt signaling

Process failures and errors can be indicated by audible signals, as well as output in the message list. The signal is issued by means of a signal module or active loudspeaker by outputting a multimedia (Wave) file via the computer's sound card.

Note

Information on the function and installation of signal modules can be found in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 WinCC Basic Process Control"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/1400148) manual.

The WinCC editor ""Horn"" offers a multitude of options (e.g., message classes, origin, areas, event, priorities) to trigger different acoustic signals. A corresponding variable (""Horn"" group) must be created for this.
