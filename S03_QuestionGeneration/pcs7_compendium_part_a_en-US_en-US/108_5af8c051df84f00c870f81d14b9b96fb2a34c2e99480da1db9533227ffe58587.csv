# Changing projects in process mode

# 11.1 Downloading changes online

# Requirement

You can only download changes online to a PCS 7 OS when runtime mode is activated on the corresponding PC. Both stations must be in runtime mode for redundant servers. In order to use the function for downloading changes online, the entire project must have been compiled and downloaded without errors at least once. Exactly the same project data must have been downloaded in full to redundant OS servers.

# Procedure

The update procedure can be performed in stages or automatically, with the help of the ""Compile and Download Objects"" dialog box.

# 11.1.1 Compiling and downloading in stages

# Procedure

1. Compile the S7 program in the CFC or SFC editor or in the plan directory of the component view. It makes no difference whether the ""Changes only"" or ""Entire program"" option is selected in terms of the AS's capacity to download changes.
2. Download the S7 program into the AS, which is in the RUN-P state, using the ""Changes"" option.
3. Compile the OS project of the master OS, using the ""Changes only"" option. This setting also ensures that the server data corresponding to the OS is updated automatically.
4. Download the OS project from the ES to the servers. Once the OS runtime is activated on the target station the ""OS-Download"" dialog box offers the option of downloading the changes. When downloading changes to a redundant OS server pair, the function first downloads the changes to the configured standby OS. Once this procedure has been executed in full and confirmed with ""OK"", the process of downloading changes to the configured master OS is started. This order is observed regardless of which of the two OS servers is currently configured as the master.

Note
The steps described should be performed promptly to ensure that no inconsistencies arise for operators between the time when the AS is changed and the time when the OS is changed. ",What is the requirement for downloading changes online to a PCS 7 OS?,"Runtime mode must be activated on the corresponding PC, and for redundant servers, both stations must be in runtime mode.","To download changes online to a PCS 7 OS, the corresponding PC must have runtime mode activated, with both stations in runtime mode if they are redundant servers.","The requirement includes having runtime mode activated on the PC for PCS 7 OS changes, and both stations in runtime mode in case of redundancy.","Activating runtime mode on the PC is necessary for downloading changes online to a PCS 7 OS, especially with both stations in runtime mode for redundancy.","For online changes download to PCS 7 OS, ensure the PC is in runtime mode, and if servers are redundant, both must be in runtime mode."

# 11.1 Downloading changes online

# Requirement

You can only download changes online to a PCS 7 OS when runtime mode is activated on the corresponding PC. Both stations must be in runtime mode for redundant servers. In order to use the function for downloading changes online, the entire project must have been compiled and downloaded without errors at least once. Exactly the same project data must have been downloaded in full to redundant OS servers.

# Procedure

The update procedure can be performed in stages or automatically, with the help of the ""Compile and Download Objects"" dialog box.

# 11.1.1 Compiling and downloading in stages

# Procedure

1. Compile the S7 program in the CFC or SFC editor or in the plan directory of the component view. It makes no difference whether the ""Changes only"" or ""Entire program"" option is selected in terms of the AS's capacity to download changes.
2. Download the S7 program into the AS, which is in the RUN-P state, using the ""Changes"" option.
3. Compile the OS project of the master OS, using the ""Changes only"" option. This setting also ensures that the server data corresponding to the OS is updated automatically.
4. Download the OS project from the ES to the servers. Once the OS runtime is activated on the target station the ""OS-Download"" dialog box offers the option of downloading the changes. When downloading changes to a redundant OS server pair, the function first downloads the changes to the configured standby OS. Once this procedure has been executed in full and confirmed with ""OK"", the process of downloading changes to the configured master OS is started. This order is observed regardless of which of the two OS servers is currently configured as the master.

Note
The steps described should be performed promptly to ensure that no inconsistencies arise for operators between the time when the AS is changed and the time when the OS is changed. ",How does the system handle downloading changes to a redundant OS server pair?,"It first downloads changes to the standby OS, then to the master OS, regardless of current master configuration.","Changes are first applied to the standby OS, followed by the master OS, irrespective of which is currently master.","The system prioritizes the standby OS for changes before the master OS, no matter the current master setup.","Initially, changes go to the standby OS, then to the master OS, even if their roles are reversed.","Downloading starts with the standby OS, then proceeds to the master OS, independent of the present master designation."

The OS clients are updated automatically. The OS client must be explicitly downloaded only where changes have been made to the OS client project (permissions in the User Administrator, for example). An OS client can only be downloaded in full.

Note

Never make changes to the OS projects on the individual OS servers and OS client stations directly, as you will not be able to use the ""Download changes"" function. In this event you must execute a complete download.

All changes are made on the ES and are then downloaded to the various OS stations. The redundancy settings for OS servers and the settings for the Web server are exceptions. The background to this and further information on downloading changes can be found in the section ""Downloading Changes to a Project"" in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

There is an option for displaying the number of changes made via the ""Details"" button in the dialog box for starting the OS download. Based on the number of changes the system suggests whether downloading the changes is sufficient or whether a complete download needs to be executed.
