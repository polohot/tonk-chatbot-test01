# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.4 Adding additional projects

The ""New Project"" wizard has already generated the ""Comp_Lib"" master data library and added it to the project. It should contain all blocks, process tag types and CMTs (control module types) used in the project as a template.

Note

A central data management in the master data library is a prerequisite for essential PCS 7 functions such as the Import Export Assistant or the automatic block update for all S7 programs in the multiproject. When CMTs are used, the instantiated CMTs can be synchronized with the source type of the master data library.

Furthermore you can use the master data library to ensure that all project engineers are working on the same database. This facilitates coordination and organization during the configuration phase and during the later project expansions or upgrades.

The ""New Project"" wizard has already generated the ""Comp_Lib"" master data library and added it to the project. It should contain all blocks, process tag types and CMTs (control module types) used in the project as a template.

Note

A central data management in the master data library is a prerequisite for essential PCS 7 functions such as the Import Export Assistant or the automatic block update for all S7 programs in the multiproject. When CMTs are used, the instantiated CMTs can be synchronized with the source type of the master data library.

Furthermore you can use the master data library to ensure that all project engineers are working on the same database. This facilitates coordination and organization during the configuration phase and during the later project expansions or upgrades.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.4 Adding additional projects

# Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to add an additional project:

1. Create a new project for Plant B. It will later contain a standard CPU.
2. Select the multiproject ""Comp_MP"" and select “Multiproject > Create in multiproject..."" in the shortcut menu.
3. Enter the name ""02_Plant_B"" (Plant_B - name of the plant) and amend the storage location where applicable.
4. Create a new project for the redundant OS server pair and the associated OS client. Select the name ""20_OS"" and the storage location.
5. Create a new project for the remaining OS clients. Select the name ""21_CL"" and the storage location.
6. Create a new project for the ES. Select the name ""25_ES"" and the storage location.
