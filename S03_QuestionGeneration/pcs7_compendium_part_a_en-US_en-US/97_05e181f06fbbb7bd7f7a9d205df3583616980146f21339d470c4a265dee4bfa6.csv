# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

# Alarm Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the constant load of messages for an OS server is less than 10 messages per second. The check can be made by additional configuration of an Alarm Control as a hitlist in a process picture.

# Tag Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the tag logging for an OS server is less than 1500 values per second. For this monitor the internal tags @TLGRT_TAGS_PER_SECOND and @TLGRT_AVERAGE_TAGS_PER_SECOND in the TagLoggingRT group.

# AS-OS communication

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the ""How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?"" FAQ.

# Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements

When limits are exceeded, appropriate measures must be taken to reduce the load of the OS server and to guarantee the performance of OS Runtime.

# 10.2.1 Structure of the picture hierarchy

You can create a hierarchical structure for the plant with up to 8 levels. Buttons are used to navigate between the process pictures.

",What factors affect the wait times when opening pictures/faceplates in AS-OS communication?,"Wait times depend on the AS load providing data for the picture/faceplate, leading to varying display times across automation systems.",The load of the automation system supplying data influences how long it takes to open pictures or faceplates.,Display delays for pictures/faceplates are affected by the data-providing AS's current load.,Variations in picture/faceplate display times are due to differences in the AS's load from which data is sourced.,The time taken to open pictures or faceplates can vary based on the load of the associated automation system.

# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

# Alarm Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the constant load of messages for an OS server is less than 10 messages per second. The check can be made by additional configuration of an Alarm Control as a hitlist in a process picture.

# Tag Logging
