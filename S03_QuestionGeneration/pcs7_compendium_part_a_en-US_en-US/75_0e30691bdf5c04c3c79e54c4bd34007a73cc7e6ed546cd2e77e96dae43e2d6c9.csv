# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.2 Creating user-defined technological blocks

# Block library

In PCS 7, user-specific blocks can be created quite easily, meaning that particular customer requirements can be met in a very flexible way. A user-defined block has a faceplate and its block icon for operating and monitoring the OS.

Be sure to always factor in the corresponding expertise, time and effort for the creation, maintenance and upkeep of your own blocks. Working with existing PCS 7 block libraries is recommended with this. A major advantage with the existing library blocks is the fact that they are serviced and maintained systematically, including with regard to different PCS 7 versions. Project teams can save time and cost as a result, particularly for future upgrades where the original project team may no longer be available.

# Criteria to consider when making decisions about creating user-defined blocks

The following points must be reviewed before creating user-defined blocks:

- What functions do any existing PCS 7 block libraries offer (e.g. PCS 7 add-on catalog) in terms of meeting your requirements?
- Does a sector-specific library already exist that covers your requirements?
- Can an existing PCS 7 block library be adapted to meet your requirements, e.g. related to the display?
- Is just one block to be created, or several blocks?
- Is there a description or specification of the functions required of the blocks to be created?
- Can user-defined blocks be maintained and serviced in the future?

# Guidelines on the range of numbers

The block number range for AS blocks 0 to 2499 is already allocated for the standard, add-on and sector-specific libraries. The FB range of numbers is therefore divided up as follows:

- Up to FB1000: Allocated with existing PCS 7 block libraries
- FB 1800-1999: Reserved for the PCS 7 system
- FB 1025 and above: Provided for SFC types
- FB 2000- 2014: Allocation for the SIMOCODE Pro library

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

To avoid any conflicts with the number ranges of existing AS blocks, assign block numbers starting from 2500 when creating your own blocks.

Note

Please note that the following CPU types do not support a block range of numbers greater than 2048:

- CPUs 412-416 with V4.x version
- H-CPU 412 and 414 with V4.x version

Numbers in the range from 1200 to 1249 are recommended when using user-defined blocks on these CPU types.

# Guidelines on naming

The system has a limit of 16 characters for symbolic names for function blocks. However, a maximum of 8 characters is recommended on account of the display in the CFC Editor. Symbolic names with more than 8 characters are not displayed in full in the CFC Editor for summary reasons.

When determining symbolic names the first characters should be allocated with the block names in order to allow the function blocks to be uniquely assigned during the configuration phase. If you want to expand a symbolic name with additional information (e.g. company abbreviation) then place this at the end of the symbolic name.

The following example illustrates the naming guidelines:

- Block name: ""CountOh""
- Symbolic name: ""CountOh_Siemens""
- Display in the CFC Editor: ""CountOh_""

# Guidelines on creation

The ""Compile chart as FB"" function should not be used when using APL blocks to create user-defined blocks as the ""S7_x"" attributes are not supported for structures. S7 SCL is provided for creating the blocks in this case.

Note

You can find detailed information on creating technological blocks according to the PCS 7 guidelines in the ""PCS 7 - Programming Instructions for Blocks"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/24449702) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.3 Creating user-defined driver blocks

Using driver blocks

Similar to the creation of technological blocks, you can also create driver blocks for non-integrated modules/devices with PCS 7. A driver block evaluates the status or the diagnostics for the modules/devices. Accordingly, a separate channel block is generally required for the actual signal processing.

The main objective of creating driver blocks is to achieve integration in the hierarchical driver concept of PCS 7. The hierarchical driver concept has been implemented in the PCS 7 Basic library and forms a basis for asset management.

# 8.1.4 Changing the message class, priority and message text

Introduction

You can change the message class, priority, and message text for all function blocks.

Note

Please take note of the ""Aspects of Message Configuration"" table in this regard in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

The appearance of limit violations at the block can be influenced in process control in group displays and in message lists. The ""User-configurable message classes"" function is available for this purpose.

# 8.1.5 Changing attributes

Introduction

You can change the attributes of any function block. For example, attribute ""S7_m_c = true"" means that the block/block I/O will be created as a structure/tag in the OS project by the OS compilation.

Procedure

Set the attributes in the properties dialog of a block I/O on the appropriate tab.

Note

First add the changes to the master data library so that the blocks in the S7 programs of the AS subprojects can be updated later (see also section: Updating block types (Page 174)). A delta download of the automation systems is still possible following changes to parameter attributes. You may need to compile and download the OS servers if you make changes to the block attributes.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.2 Creating user-defined technological blocks

# Block library

In PCS 7, user-specific blocks can be created quite easily, meaning that particular customer requirements can be met in a very flexible way. A user-defined block has a faceplate and its block icon for operating and monitoring the OS.

Be sure to always factor in the corresponding expertise, time and effort for the creation, maintenance and upkeep of your own blocks. Working with existing PCS 7 block libraries is recommended with this. A major advantage with the existing library blocks is the fact that they are serviced and maintained systematically, including with regard to different PCS 7 versions. Project teams can save time and cost as a result, particularly for future upgrades where the original project team may no longer be available.

# Criteria to consider when making decisions about creating user-defined blocks

The following points must be reviewed before creating user-defined blocks:

- What functions do any existing PCS 7 block libraries offer (e.g. PCS 7 add-on catalog) in terms of meeting your requirements?
- Does a sector-specific library already exist that covers your requirements?
- Can an existing PCS 7 block library be adapted to meet your requirements, e.g. related to the display?
- Is just one block to be created, or several blocks?
- Is there a description or specification of the functions required of the blocks to be created?
- Can user-defined blocks be maintained and serviced in the future?

# Guidelines on the range of numbers

The block number range for AS blocks 0 to 2499 is already allocated for the standard, add-on and sector-specific libraries. The FB range of numbers is therefore divided up as follows:

- Up to FB1000: Allocated with existing PCS 7 block libraries
- FB 1800-1999: Reserved for the PCS 7 system
- FB 1025 and above: Provided for SFC types
- FB 2000- 2014: Allocation for the SIMOCODE Pro library

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

To avoid any conflicts with the number ranges of existing AS blocks, assign block numbers starting from 2500 when creating your own blocks.

Note

Please note that the following CPU types do not support a block range of numbers greater than 2048:

- CPUs 412-416 with V4.x version
- H-CPU 412 and 414 with V4.x version

Numbers in the range from 1200 to 1249 are recommended when using user-defined blocks on these CPU types.

# Guidelines on naming

The system has a limit of 16 characters for symbolic names for function blocks. However, a maximum of 8 characters is recommended on account of the display in the CFC Editor. Symbolic names with more than 8 characters are not displayed in full in the CFC Editor for summary reasons.

When determining symbolic names the first characters should be allocated with the block names in order to allow the function blocks to be uniquely assigned during the configuration phase. If you want to expand a symbolic name with additional information (e.g. company abbreviation) then place this at the end of the symbolic name.

The following example illustrates the naming guidelines:

- Block name: ""CountOh""
- Symbolic name: ""CountOh_Siemens""
- Display in the CFC Editor: ""CountOh_""

# Guidelines on creation

The ""Compile chart as FB"" function should not be used when using APL blocks to create user-defined blocks as the ""S7_x"" attributes are not supported for structures. S7 SCL is provided for creating the blocks in this case.

Note

You can find detailed information on creating technological blocks according to the PCS 7 guidelines in the ""PCS 7 - Programming Instructions for Blocks"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/24449702) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.3 Creating user-defined driver blocks

Using driver blocks

Similar to the creation of technological blocks, you can also create driver blocks for non-integrated modules/devices with PCS 7. A driver block evaluates the status or the diagnostics for the modules/devices. Accordingly, a separate channel block is generally required for the actual signal processing.

The main objective of creating driver blocks is to achieve integration in the hierarchical driver concept of PCS 7. The hierarchical driver concept has been implemented in the PCS 7 Basic library and forms a basis for asset management.

# 8.1.4 Changing the message class, priority and message text

Introduction

You can change the message class, priority, and message text for all function blocks.

Note

Please take note of the ""Aspects of Message Configuration"" table in this regard in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

The appearance of limit violations at the block can be influenced in process control in group displays and in message lists. The ""User-configurable message classes"" function is available for this purpose.

Introduction

You can change the attributes of any function block. For example, attribute ""S7_m_c = true"" means that the block/block I/O will be created as a structure/tag in the OS project by the OS compilation.

Procedure

Set the attributes in the properties dialog of a block I/O on the appropriate tab.

Note

First add the changes to the master data library so that the blocks in the S7 programs of the AS subprojects can be updated later (see also section: Updating block types (Page 174)). A delta download of the automation systems is still possible following changes to parameter attributes. You may need to compile and download the OS servers if you make changes to the block attributes.

# 8.1 Principles

Type updating in RUN (TCiR, Type Change in RUN)

In connection with the CPU 410 (firmware V8.1 or higher) and PCS 7 version (V8.1 or higher), a type update in RUN mode is supported. This makes it possible to update the instances and download them to the CPU in RUN mode after changing an interface at the block types.

Note

You can find further information on the subject of ""Type updating in RUN"" in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 CFC for SIMATIC S7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748700) manual and in the ""Process automation with the SIMATIC PCS 7 CPU 410-5H controller"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/96839331) application example.

Driver blocks act as an interface between the I/O modules, PI devices and the S7 program. Input/output signals and status information (e.g. ",What is the significance of the 'S7_m_c = true' attribute in PCS 7?,It indicates that the block/block I/O will be created as a structure/tag in the OS project during OS compilation.,This attribute ensures the block or its I/O is structured or tagged in the OS project post-compilation.,Setting 'S7_m_c = true' means the block's I/O will be treated as a structure or tag in the OS project.,The attribute 'S7_m_c = true' designates the block for structure or tag creation in the OS project upon compilation.,"When 'S7_m_c = true', the block is marked to be compiled into a structure or tag within the OS project."

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.2 Creating user-defined technological blocks

# Block library

In PCS 7, user-specific blocks can be created quite easily, meaning that particular customer requirements can be met in a very flexible way. A user-defined block has a faceplate and its block icon for operating and monitoring the OS.

Be sure to always factor in the corresponding expertise, time and effort for the creation, maintenance and upkeep of your own blocks. Working with existing PCS 7 block libraries is recommended with this. A major advantage with the existing library blocks is the fact that they are serviced and maintained systematically, including with regard to different PCS 7 versions. Project teams can save time and cost as a result, particularly for future upgrades where the original project team may no longer be available.

# Criteria to consider when making decisions about creating user-defined blocks

The following points must be reviewed before creating user-defined blocks:

- What functions do any existing PCS 7 block libraries offer (e.g. PCS 7 add-on catalog) in terms of meeting your requirements?
- Does a sector-specific library already exist that covers your requirements?
- Can an existing PCS 7 block library be adapted to meet your requirements, e.g. related to the display?
- Is just one block to be created, or several blocks?
- Is there a description or specification of the functions required of the blocks to be created?
- Can user-defined blocks be maintained and serviced in the future?

# Guidelines on the range of numbers

The block number range for AS blocks 0 to 2499 is already allocated for the standard, add-on and sector-specific libraries. The FB range of numbers is therefore divided up as follows:

- Up to FB1000: Allocated with existing PCS 7 block libraries
- FB 1800-1999: Reserved for the PCS 7 system
- FB 1025 and above: Provided for SFC types
- FB 2000- 2014: Allocation for the SIMOCODE Pro library

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

To avoid any conflicts with the number ranges of existing AS blocks, assign block numbers starting from 2500 when creating your own blocks.

Note

Please note that the following CPU types do not support a block range of numbers greater than 2048:

- CPUs 412-416 with V4.x version
- H-CPU 412 and 414 with V4.x version

Numbers in the range from 1200 to 1249 are recommended when using user-defined blocks on these CPU types.

# Guidelines on naming

The system has a limit of 16 characters for symbolic names for function blocks. However, a maximum of 8 characters is recommended on account of the display in the CFC Editor. Symbolic names with more than 8 characters are not displayed in full in the CFC Editor for summary reasons.

When determining symbolic names the first characters should be allocated with the block names in order to allow the function blocks to be uniquely assigned during the configuration phase. If you want to expand a symbolic name with additional information (e.g. company abbreviation) then place this at the end of the symbolic name.

The following example illustrates the naming guidelines:

- Block name: ""CountOh""
- Symbolic name: ""CountOh_Siemens""
- Display in the CFC Editor: ""CountOh_""

# Guidelines on creation

The ""Compile chart as FB"" function should not be used when using APL blocks to create user-defined blocks as the ""S7_x"" attributes are not supported for structures. S7 SCL is provided for creating the blocks in this case.

Note

You can find detailed information on creating technological blocks according to the PCS 7 guidelines in the ""PCS 7 - Programming Instructions for Blocks"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/24449702) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.3 Creating user-defined driver blocks

Using driver blocks

Similar to the creation of technological blocks, you can also create driver blocks for non-integrated modules/devices with PCS 7. A driver block evaluates the status or the diagnostics for the modules/devices. Accordingly, a separate channel block is generally required for the actual signal processing.

The main objective of creating driver blocks is to achieve integration in the hierarchical driver concept of PCS 7. The hierarchical driver concept has been implemented in the PCS 7 Basic library and forms a basis for asset management.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.6 Updating block types

Introduction

You can update changed block types automatically in the individual S7 programs from the master data library.

The charts of the master data library (blocks from process tag types/models) are automatically updated in addition to the S7 programs in the AS subprojects with the ""Update block types"" system function.

SFC types from the master data library in the S7 programs can also be centrally updated.

Once the engineering phase is complete all the block types used should be present in their current version in the master data library and should match the configured types within the multiproject.

Type updating in RUN (TCiR, Type Change in RUN)

In connection with the CPU 410 (firmware V8.1 or higher) and PCS 7 version (V8.1 or higher), a type update in RUN mode is supported. This makes it possible to update the instances and download them to the CPU in RUN mode after changing an interface at the block types.

Note

You can find further information on the subject of ""Type updating in RUN"" in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 CFC for SIMATIC S7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748700) manual and in the ""Process automation with the SIMATIC PCS 7 CPU 410-5H controller"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/96839331) application example.

# 8.1.7 Driver concept

# General principle

Driver blocks act as an interface between the I/O modules, PI devices and the S7 program. Input/output signals and status information (e.g. ",What are the guidelines for naming symbolic names in PCS 7?,Start with the block name for unique assignment during configuration and append any additional information at the end.,"Begin the symbolic name with the block name to ensure uniqueness, adding extra details like company abbreviations last.","For clarity and uniqueness, prefix the symbolic name with the block name, placing supplementary information afterwards.","Symbolic names should lead with the block name to facilitate identification, with any extensions tagged on at the end.","To maintain uniqueness, the initial characters of symbolic names should match the block name, followed by any additional descriptors."

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.2 Creating user-defined technological blocks

# Block library

In PCS 7, user-specific blocks can be created quite easily, meaning that particular customer requirements can be met in a very flexible way. A user-defined block has a faceplate and its block icon for operating and monitoring the OS.

Be sure to always factor in the corresponding expertise, time and effort for the creation, maintenance and upkeep of your own blocks. Working with existing PCS 7 block libraries is recommended with this. A major advantage with the existing library blocks is the fact that they are serviced and maintained systematically, including with regard to different PCS 7 versions. Project teams can save time and cost as a result, particularly for future upgrades where the original project team may no longer be available.

# Criteria to consider when making decisions about creating user-defined blocks

The following points must be reviewed before creating user-defined blocks:

- What functions do any existing PCS 7 block libraries offer (e.g. PCS 7 add-on catalog) in terms of meeting your requirements?
- Does a sector-specific library already exist that covers your requirements?
- Can an existing PCS 7 block library be adapted to meet your requirements, e.g. related to the display?
- Is just one block to be created, or several blocks?
- Is there a description or specification of the functions required of the blocks to be created?
- Can user-defined blocks be maintained and serviced in the future?

# Guidelines on the range of numbers

The block number range for AS blocks 0 to 2499 is already allocated for the standard, add-on and sector-specific libraries. The FB range of numbers is therefore divided up as follows:

- Up to FB1000: Allocated with existing PCS 7 block libraries
- FB 1800-1999: Reserved for the PCS 7 system
- FB 1025 and above: Provided for SFC types
- FB 2000- 2014: Allocation for the SIMOCODE Pro library

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

To avoid any conflicts with the number ranges of existing AS blocks, assign block numbers starting from 2500 when creating your own blocks.

Note

Please note that the following CPU types do not support a block range of numbers greater than 2048:

- CPUs 412-416 with V4.x version
- H-CPU 412 and 414 with V4.x version

Numbers in the range from 1200 to 1249 are recommended when using user-defined blocks on these CPU types.

# Guidelines on naming

The system has a limit of 16 characters for symbolic names for function blocks. However, a maximum of 8 characters is recommended on account of the display in the CFC Editor. Symbolic names with more than 8 characters are not displayed in full in the CFC Editor for summary reasons.

When determining symbolic names the first characters should be allocated with the block names in order to allow the function blocks to be uniquely assigned during the configuration phase. If you want to expand a symbolic name with additional information (e.g. company abbreviation) then place this at the end of the symbolic name.

The following example illustrates the naming guidelines:

- Block name: ""CountOh""
- Symbolic name: ""CountOh_Siemens""
- Display in the CFC Editor: ""CountOh_""

# Guidelines on creation

The ""Compile chart as FB"" function should not be used when using APL blocks to create user-defined blocks as the ""S7_x"" attributes are not supported for structures. S7 SCL is provided for creating the blocks in this case.

Note

You can find detailed information on creating technological blocks according to the PCS 7 guidelines in the ""PCS 7 - Programming Instructions for Blocks"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/24449702) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.3 Creating user-defined driver blocks

Using driver blocks

Similar to the creation of technological blocks, you can also create driver blocks for non-integrated modules/devices with PCS 7. A driver block evaluates the status or the diagnostics for the modules/devices. Accordingly, a separate channel block is generally required for the actual signal processing.

The main objective of creating driver blocks is to achieve integration in the hierarchical driver concept of PCS 7. The hierarchical driver concept has been implemented in the PCS 7 Basic library and forms a basis for asset management.

# 8.1.4 Changing the message class, priority and message text

Introduction

You can change the message class, priority, and message text for all function blocks.

Note

Please take note of the ""Aspects of Message Configuration"" table in this regard in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

The appearance of limit violations at the block can be influenced in process control in group displays and in message lists. The ""User-configurable message classes"" function is available for this purpose.

You can find additional information on the topic of ""User-configurable message classes"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

# Procedure

To do this, click on an FB in the master data library and select ""Special Object Properties > Message"".

Note

First take care of the changes in the master data library and then update the FBs in the S7 programs of the AS subprojects (see also section: Updating block types (Page 174)). Once these changes have been made, a delta download of the automation systems is still possible. You will need to compile and download the OS servers if you make changes in the PCS 7 message configuration.

# 8.1.5 Changing attributes

Introduction

You can change the attributes of any function block. For example, attribute ""S7_m_c = true"" means that the block/block I/O will be created as a structure/tag in the OS project by the OS compilation.

Procedure

Set the attributes in the properties dialog of a block I/O on the appropriate tab.

Note

First add the changes to the master data library so that the blocks in the S7 programs of the AS subprojects can be updated later (see also section: Updating block types (Page 174)). A delta download of the automation systems is still possible following changes to parameter attributes. You may need to compile and download the OS servers if you make changes to the block attributes. You can find information on S7 attributes in the ""PCS 7 Programming Guide for Blocks"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/24449702) manual.
