# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

# Redundant I/O modules

High availability in PCS 7 is achieved on the field level through the use of redundant distributed I/O. When PROFIBUS DP is used, the ET 200M enables the redundant configuration. When PROFINET is used, the ET 200SP HA provides the option of a redundant connection and IO redundancy.

Note

You can find information on installing, wiring and configuring redundant I/O modules based on ET 200M and PROFIBUS in the ""Configuration of Redundant I/O Modules"" document.

You can find information on installing, wiring and configuring the ET 200SP HA in the following documents:

# 6.7 Plant changes during operation

# Introduction

With CiR (Configuration in RUN) it is possible to make certain hardware configuration changes in RUN mode. Typical reasons for doing this include the complexity of the automated process and high restart costs.
The Configuration in RUN function is available for use on PROFIBUS DP and PROFINET. For Configuration in Run (CiR) on PROFINET, CPU 410 Firmware V8.2 or higher is required.

# 6.7.1 Configuration in Run on PROFIBUS DP

In the case of standard automation systems and PROFIBUS DP, Configuration in Run (CiR) is available only after activation of the function in HW Config and a one-time download of the AS in STOP.

# Procedure

1. To activate CiR in HW Config, right-click on the subnet (DP master system) and select ""Activate CiR capability"" from the shortcut menu. This attaches a CiR object to the respective master system. It offers the possibility of configuring an adjustable number of DP slaves in the future and downloading the changes without a CPU STOP. Each existing DP slave automatically receives an orange colored title as a sign that it can be changed.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.7 Plant changes during operation

1. Adapt the object properties of the CiR object to your plans. If the guaranteed number of additional DP slaves has been exhausted then a planned STOP of the AS can be used to increase the number and to activate through a complete download.
2. When CiR is activated, you have a CiR module in the first free slot within ET 200M and ET 200SP. It offers the possibility of configuring and loading an adjustable number of modules in the future. Adapt the object properties of the CiR modules to your plans.
3. After activating CiR and checking the CiR settings in the CiR objects and CiR modules, save and compile the hardware configuration and download it to the automation system in the STOP operating mode. Following this you can run the ""Download in RUN mode"" function in HW Config.

# Changes to the hardware configuration of an H-system

The CiR functionality described above is available in the H system without any special settings. There are no CiR objects or CiR modules in the H system and the function does not need to be explicitly activated. You can use the ""Download in RUN mode"" function immediately. This opens an additional dialog, in which you can start the tasks required for changing the configuration.

Note

You can find a detailed description of the possible hardware changes with CiR on PROFIBUS DP in the following manuals:

- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""
- ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System""

# 6.7.2 Configuration in Run on PROFINET

A prerequisite for the ""Configuration in Run"" function (CiR) on PROFINET is the use of CPU 410 Firmware V8.2 or higher and PCS 7 V9.0 or higher. The scope of the ""Configuration in Run"" function is different for standard automation systems (CiR) and H-systems (H-CiR). In contrast to PROFIBUS DP, no CiR objects are needed for CiR/H-CiR on PROFINET and no address spaces have to be reserved.

Which changes are possible as a CiR/H-CiR operation is dependent on whether the utilized (changed) IO device supports CiR functionality.

|Removing submodule|x|✓|
|Reassigning submodule parameters|x|✓|
|Interface parameter assignment|x|✓|

Changes to the hardware configuration of a standard AS

When CiR is used in a standard automation system, processing is stopped briefly for the download operation (CiR synchronization time). During this time, process inputs and outputs keep their last value. When the CPU 410-5H is used, the maximum CiR synchronization time is 60 ms.

Changes to the hardware configuration of a standard AS

When CiR is used in a standard automation system, processing is stopped briefly for the download operation (CiR synchronization time). During this time, process inputs and outputs keep their last value. When the CPU 410-5H is used, the maximum CiR synchronization time is 60 ms.

# 6.7 Plant changes during operation

# Introduction

With CiR (Configuration in RUN) it is possible to make certain hardware configuration changes in RUN mode. Typical reasons for doing this include the complexity of the automated process and high restart costs.
The Configuration in RUN function is available for use on PROFIBUS DP and PROFINET. For Configuration in Run (CiR) on PROFINET, CPU 410 Firmware V8.2 or higher is required.

# 6.7.1 Configuration in Run on PROFIBUS DP

In the case of standard automation systems and PROFIBUS DP, Configuration in Run (CiR) is available only after activation of the function in HW Config and a one-time download of the AS in STOP.

# Procedure

1. To activate CiR in HW Config, right-click on the subnet (DP master system) and select ""Activate CiR capability"" from the shortcut menu. This attaches a CiR object to the respective master system. It offers the possibility of configuring an adjustable number of DP slaves in the future and downloading the changes without a CPU STOP. Each existing DP slave automatically receives an orange colored title as a sign that it can be changed.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.7 Plant changes during operation

1. Adapt the object properties of the CiR object to your plans. If the guaranteed number of additional DP slaves has been exhausted then a planned STOP of the AS can be used to increase the number and to activate through a complete download.
2. When CiR is activated, you have a CiR module in the first free slot within ET 200M and ET 200SP. It offers the possibility of configuring and loading an adjustable number of modules in the future. Adapt the object properties of the CiR modules to your plans.
3. After activating CiR and checking the CiR settings in the CiR objects and CiR modules, save and compile the hardware configuration and download it to the automation system in the STOP operating mode. Following this you can run the ""Download in RUN mode"" function in HW Config.

# Changes to the hardware configuration of an H-system

The CiR functionality described above is available in the H system without any special settings. There are no CiR objects or CiR modules in the H system and the function does not need to be explicitly activated. You can use the ""Download in RUN mode"" function immediately. This opens an additional dialog, in which you can start the tasks required for changing the configuration.

1. Adapt the object properties of the CiR object to your plans. If the guaranteed number of additional DP slaves has been exhausted then a planned STOP of the AS can be used to increase the number and to activate through a complete download.
2. When CiR is activated, you have a CiR module in the first free slot within ET 200M and ET 200SP. It offers the possibility of configuring and loading an adjustable number of modules in the future. Adapt the object properties of the CiR modules to your plans.
3. After activating CiR and checking the CiR settings in the CiR objects and CiR modules, save and compile the hardware configuration and download it to the automation system in the STOP operating mode. Following this you can run the ""Download in RUN mode"" function in HW Config.

# Changes to the hardware configuration of an H-system

The CiR functionality described above is available in the H system without any special settings. There are no CiR objects or CiR modules in the H system and the function does not need to be explicitly activated. You can use the ""Download in RUN mode"" function immediately. This opens an additional dialog, in which you can start the tasks required for changing the configuration.

Changes to the hardware configuration of a standard AS

When CiR is used in a standard automation system, processing is stopped briefly for the download operation (CiR synchronization time). During this time, process inputs and outputs keep their last value. When the CPU 410-5H is used, the maximum CiR synchronization time is 60 ms.
