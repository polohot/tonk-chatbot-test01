# 10.9.1 User Administrator

# Scope of functions

The ""User Administrator"" editor of the ""WinCC Configuration Studio"" is used to establish user
administration.

The editor is used to assign access rights to users for individual editors in the configuration
system and to functions in process mode, as well as to monitor these rights. To this end,
access rights, also known as authorizations, are assigned for OS functions in the User
Administrator. These authorizations can be assigned to individual users or to user groups;
they can also be assigned during process mode.

Other characteristics of the User Administrator:

- Configuration functions for ""variable logon"", which a user can employ to log on to the OS
client. This can be achieved by means of a variable value, for example, which is set via a
key-operated switch.
- Automatic user logoff after a certain period of time
- User logon via a smart card

SIMATIC Logon is supplied with ""Contract License"" in SIMATIC PCS 7 V7.1 and above. This means there are no further licensing costs for SIMATIC Logon within PCS 7. As a result, we generally recommend that SIMATIC Logon is used, as it provides more benefits than WinCC Logon and is not associated with any additional costs.

Note: SIMATIC Logon and the User Administrator write different user information to a smart card. SIMATIC Logon also requires the information as to which logon computer or domain controller should be used for user authentication. This is why the Smart card must be specified again with any change from SIMATIC Logon to WinCC Logon or vice-versa.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.2 WinCC Logon

# Method of operation

When a user logs on to the system with a user name and password, the User Administrator checks whether that user has been created in the OS. If the user has not been created, he/she will not be assigned any authorizations in the OS; the same applies if an incorrect password is entered.

This means that the user will not be able to monitor or control the process in process mode. If a properly logged-on user calls an OS functionality which is protected by an authorization, the User Administrator checks whether the relevant authorizations permit this function to be accessed. If the appropriate authorizations are not in place, the User Administrator denies the user access to the requested functionality.

User groups, users, and their passwords are managed in the ""User Administrator"" editor. The user groups, users, and passwords must be created separately in every OS client. In order to avoid having to duplicate creation work in the OS clients, you can work with referenced OS clients. For referenced OS clients, however, the user administration configurations must be exactly the same for every client.

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.
3. The user logs on to OS client 2.
4. The User Administrator of the OS client 2 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.

# 10.9.1 User Administrator

# Scope of functions

The ""User Administrator"" editor of the ""WinCC Configuration Studio"" is used to establish user
administration.

The editor is used to assign access rights to users for individual editors in the configuration
system and to functions in process mode, as well as to monitor these rights. To this end,
access rights, also known as authorizations, are assigned for OS functions in the User
Administrator. These authorizations can be assigned to individual users or to user groups;
they can also be assigned during process mode.

Other characteristics of the User Administrator:

- Configuration functions for ""variable logon"", which a user can employ to log on to the OS
client. This can be achieved by means of a variable value, for example, which is set via a
key-operated switch.
- Automatic user logoff after a certain period of time
- User logon via a smart card

SIMATIC Logon is supplied with ""Contract License"" in SIMATIC PCS 7 V7.1 and above. This means there are no further licensing costs for SIMATIC Logon within PCS 7. As a result, we generally recommend that SIMATIC Logon is used, as it provides more benefits than WinCC Logon and is not associated with any additional costs.

Note: SIMATIC Logon and the User Administrator write different user information to a smart card. SIMATIC Logon also requires the information as to which logon computer or domain controller should be used for user authentication. This is why the Smart card must be specified again with any change from SIMATIC Logon to WinCC Logon or vice-versa.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.2 WinCC Logon

# Method of operation

When a user logs on to the system with a user name and password, the User Administrator checks whether that user has been created in the OS. If the user has not been created, he/she will not be assigned any authorizations in the OS; the same applies if an incorrect password is entered.

This means that the user will not be able to monitor or control the process in process mode. If a properly logged-on user calls an OS functionality which is protected by an authorization, the User Administrator checks whether the relevant authorizations permit this function to be accessed. If the appropriate authorizations are not in place, the User Administrator denies the user access to the requested functionality.

User groups, users, and their passwords are managed in the ""User Administrator"" editor. The user groups, users, and passwords must be created separately in every OS client. In order to avoid having to duplicate creation work in the OS clients, you can work with referenced OS clients. For referenced OS clients, however, the user administration configurations must be exactly the same for every client.

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.
3. The user logs on to OS client 2.
4. The User Administrator of the OS client 2 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.

When a user logs on to the system with a user name and password, the User Administrator checks whether that user has been created in the OS. If the user has not been created, he/she will not be assigned any authorizations in the OS; the same applies if an incorrect password is entered.

This means that the user will not be able to monitor or control the process in process mode. If a properly logged-on user calls an OS functionality which is protected by an authorization, the User Administrator checks whether the relevant authorizations permit this function to be accessed. If the appropriate authorizations are not in place, the User Administrator denies the user access to the requested functionality.

User groups, users, and their passwords are managed in the ""User Administrator"" editor. The user groups, users, and passwords must be created separately in every OS client. In order to avoid having to duplicate creation work in the OS clients, you can work with referenced OS clients. For referenced OS clients, however, the user administration configurations must be exactly the same for every client.

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.
3. The user logs on to OS client 2.
4. The User Administrator of the OS client 2 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.

""Logon_Administrator"" Windows group

To configure SIMATIC Logon, a Windows group called ""Logon_Administrator"" is required. In version V1.5 and above this group is set up automatically when installing SIMATIC Logon on the local computer. All users who are stipulated as members of the Windows ""Logon_Administrator"" group are authorized to access the logon dialog box ""Configure SIMATIC Logon"".

The ""User Administrator"" editor of the ""WinCC Configuration Studio"" is used to establish user
administration.

The editor is used to assign access rights to users for individual editors in the configuration
system and to functions in process mode, as well as to monitor these rights. To this end,
access rights, also known as authorizations, are assigned for OS functions in the User
Administrator. These authorizations can be assigned to individual users or to user groups;
they can also be assigned during process mode.

Other characteristics of the User Administrator:

- Configuration functions for ""variable logon"", which a user can employ to log on to the OS
client. This can be achieved by means of a variable value, for example, which is set via a
key-operated switch.
- Automatic user logoff after a certain period of time
- User logon via a smart card

|No central administration for users/user groups is required.|Suitable|Suitable|
|Logon and logoff procedures are to be logged.|Suitable|Not suitable|

SIMATIC Logon is supplied with ""Contract License"" in SIMATIC PCS 7 V7.1 and above. This means there are no further licensing costs for SIMATIC Logon within PCS 7. As a result, we generally recommend that SIMATIC Logon is used, as it provides more benefits than WinCC Logon and is not associated with any additional costs.

Note: SIMATIC Logon and the User Administrator write different user information to a smart card. SIMATIC Logon also requires the information as to which logon computer or domain controller should be used for user authentication. This is why the Smart card must be specified again with any change from SIMATIC Logon to WinCC Logon or vice-versa.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.1 User Administrator

# Scope of functions

The ""User Administrator"" editor of the ""WinCC Configuration Studio"" is used to establish user
administration.

The editor is used to assign access rights to users for individual editors in the configuration
system and to functions in process mode, as well as to monitor these rights. To this end,
access rights, also known as authorizations, are assigned for OS functions in the User
Administrator. These authorizations can be assigned to individual users or to user groups;
they can also be assigned during process mode.

Other characteristics of the User Administrator:

- Configuration functions for ""variable logon"", which a user can employ to log on to the OS
client. This can be achieved by means of a variable value, for example, which is set via a
key-operated switch.
- Automatic user logoff after a certain period of time
- User logon via a smart card

|Logon and logoff procedures are to be logged.|Suitable|Not suitable|

SIMATIC Logon is supplied with ""Contract License"" in SIMATIC PCS 7 V7.1 and above. This means there are no further licensing costs for SIMATIC Logon within PCS 7. As a result, we generally recommend that SIMATIC Logon is used, as it provides more benefits than WinCC Logon and is not associated with any additional costs.

Note: SIMATIC Logon and the User Administrator write different user information to a smart card. SIMATIC Logon also requires the information as to which logon computer or domain controller should be used for user authentication. This is why the Smart card must be specified again with any change from SIMATIC Logon to WinCC Logon or vice-versa.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.2 WinCC Logon

# Method of operation

When a user logs on to the system with a user name and password, the User Administrator checks whether that user has been created in the OS. If the user has not been created, he/she will not be assigned any authorizations in the OS; the same applies if an incorrect password is entered.

This means that the user will not be able to monitor or control the process in process mode. If a properly logged-on user calls an OS functionality which is protected by an authorization, the User Administrator checks whether the relevant authorizations permit this function to be accessed. If the appropriate authorizations are not in place, the User Administrator denies the user access to the requested functionality.

User groups, users, and their passwords are managed in the ""User Administrator"" editor. The user groups, users, and passwords must be created separately in every OS client. In order to avoid having to duplicate creation work in the OS clients, you can work with referenced OS clients. For referenced OS clients, however, the user administration configurations must be exactly the same for every client.

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.
3. The user logs on to OS client 2.
4. The User Administrator of the OS client 2 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.7 OpenPCS 7

# Introduction

Data from PCS 7 is also available to higher-level systems with Open PCS 7 (e.g. plant management level). The following standard interfaces can be used to exchange data from OpenPCS 7 stations:

- OPC UA (Unified Architecture)
- OPC DA (Data Access)
- OPC HDA (Historical Data Access)
- OPC A&E (Alarm & Events)
- OPC ""H"" A&E (Historical Alarm & Events)
- OLE/DB for OLE-enabled applications (e.g. MS Office products) and for accessing historical values, alarms and messages via standardized database access.

Note

System description

You will find a detailed description of how to use the OpenPCS 7 solution in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 OpenPCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746548) manual.

# 10.8 SIMATIC PDM server/client structure

The server/client structure is supported starting in SIMATIC PDM V9.0. This means you can access the interactive PDM portal of the webserver via the browser on a PC or mobile device without SIMATIC software. The PDM portal makes various filters available thanks to the revised process device plant view and allows individual process devices to be retrieved for diagnosis and parameter assignment. The access rights are configured specific to requirements via the PDM Role Management.

Note

You can find additional information on using the server/client structure with SIMATIC PDM V9.1 in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Help with SIMATIC PDM (V9.1)"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482406) manual.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.1 User Administrator

# Scope of functions

The ""User Administrator"" editor of the ""WinCC Configuration Studio"" is used to establish user
administration.

The editor is used to assign access rights to users for individual editors in the configuration
system and to functions in process mode, as well as to monitor these rights. To this end,
access rights, also known as authorizations, are assigned for OS functions in the User
Administrator. These authorizations can be assigned to individual users or to user groups;
they can also be assigned during process mode.

Other characteristics of the User Administrator:

- Configuration functions for ""variable logon"", which a user can employ to log on to the OS
client. This can be achieved by means of a variable value, for example, which is set via a
key-operated switch.
- Automatic user logoff after a certain period of time
- User logon via a smart card

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

You can choose between two user administration options:

- WinCC Logon
- SIMATIC Logon

Note: You have the option of exporting or importing the entire configuration or selected parts of the user administrator (e.g. in *.csv format).

# Selection guide for WinCC Logon and SIMATIC Logon

|Criterion|SIMATIC Logon|WinCC Logon|
|---|---|---|
|In process mode, the operator must be authenticated on a PC for multiple applications (OS, SIMATIC BATCH, Route Control, Automation License Manager, SIMATIC Manager, SIMATIC PDM).|Suitable|Not suitable|
|A client/server project with multiple OS clients is used.|Suitable|Not suitable|
|A single station is used, or a client/server project with just a few OS clients.|Suitable|Suitable|
|The OS clients are referenced OS clients.|Suitable|Not suitable|
|Web access as PDM client via browser / MS client via diagnostics faceplate|Suitable|Not suitable|
|One central administration for users/user groups is required.|Suitable|Not suitable|
|No central administration for users/user groups is required.|Suitable|Suitable|
|Logon and logoff procedures are to be logged.|Suitable|Not suitable|

SIMATIC Logon is supplied with ""Contract License"" in SIMATIC PCS 7 V7.1 and above. This means there are no further licensing costs for SIMATIC Logon within PCS 7. As a result, we generally recommend that SIMATIC Logon is used, as it provides more benefits than WinCC Logon and is not associated with any additional costs.

Note: SIMATIC Logon and the User Administrator write different user information to a smart card. SIMATIC Logon also requires the information as to which logon computer or domain controller should be used for user authentication. This is why the Smart card must be specified again with any change from SIMATIC Logon to WinCC Logon or vice-versa.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.2 WinCC Logon

# Method of operation

When a user logs on to the system with a user name and password, the User Administrator checks whether that user has been created in the OS. If the user has not been created, he/she will not be assigned any authorizations in the OS; the same applies if an incorrect password is entered.

This means that the user will not be able to monitor or control the process in process mode. If a properly logged-on user calls an OS functionality which is protected by an authorization, the User Administrator checks whether the relevant authorizations permit this function to be accessed. If the appropriate authorizations are not in place, the User Administrator denies the user access to the requested functionality.

User groups, users, and their passwords are managed in the ""User Administrator"" editor. The user groups, users, and passwords must be created separately in every OS client. In order to avoid having to duplicate creation work in the OS clients, you can work with referenced OS clients. For referenced OS clients, however, the user administration configurations must be exactly the same for every client.

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.
3. The user logs on to OS client 2.
4. The User Administrator of the OS client 2 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.

""Logon_Administrator"" Windows group

To configure SIMATIC Logon, a Windows group called ""Logon_Administrator"" is required. In version V1.5 and above this group is set up automatically when installing SIMATIC Logon on the local computer. All users who are stipulated as members of the Windows ""Logon_Administrator"" group are authorized to access the logon dialog box ""Configure SIMATIC Logon"".

The following image shows an example of the ""Logon_Administrator"" group where the user ""logon"" has been added:

Note

SIMATIC Logon users must be direct members of a Windows group. These users may not be members of a subgroup of a Windows group.

You can find information on Windows users and groups, for example, at the following link: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd861336.aspx
