# Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the configuration engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured in conformance with PCS 7 as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration, which is based on the results of a great deal of practical experience. ","What responsibilities does Siemens outline for customers regarding security measures in their plants, systems, machines, and networks?","Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines, and networks, and should implement appropriate security measures like firewalls and network segmentation when connecting to enterprise networks or the Internet.","Siemens states that customers must ensure unauthorized access is prevented to their operational technology by applying necessary security measures, including the use of firewalls and network segmentation, especially when connecting to broader networks.","According to Siemens, it's the customer's duty to secure their plants, systems, machines, and networks against unauthorized access, recommending specific security practices such as employing firewalls and segmenting networks for connected systems.","Siemens emphasizes customer responsibility in safeguarding their operational environments from unauthorized access, advising on the implementation of security measures like firewalls and network segmentation for systems connected to enterprise networks or the Internet.","The customer has the obligation to block unauthorized access to their Siemens-operated plants, systems, machines, and networks, with Siemens suggesting the adoption of security measures including firewalls and network segmentation for necessary connections."
