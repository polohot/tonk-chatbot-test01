# 10.9 User administration

Note

If you run SIMATIC Logon with a logon computer, this computer must be available at all times and must not demonstrate any excessive peak loads; Using the ES as the logon computer is not recommended for this reason.

With SIMATIC Logon you can log on via the local computer, irrespective of whether you are working with a logon computer or a domain. We recommend that you create all the necessary users and groups on the local computer also, so that you can still log on to applications when the logon computer or domain are unavailable.

# Configuring user administration

The following steps provide examples of how user management can be configured in association with SIMATIC Logon. The ""Operators"" group has been created as an example. You will need a valid SIMATIC Logon installation in order to execute the steps.

1. Open the OS client project on the ES.
2. Open the ""User Administrator"" editor.
3. Activate the ""SIMATIC Logon"" option.
