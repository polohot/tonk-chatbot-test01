# Requirement

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to load OS projects:

- Required target path authorizations are set.
- The logged-on user must be a member of the Windows user group ""SIMATIC HMI"".

Note

You can find details regarding the requirements for downloading OS projects in the ""Downloading and activating a project"" section of the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# Procedure

By and large, individual OS projects, OS servers, and OS clients are downloaded in the same way. This is illustrated below, using SERVER1A as an example.

1. In the component view, select the OS object you want to download, then select the ""PLC > Download"" menu command.

NOTICE

In PCS 7 this is the only permissible method of downloading OS projects to the target computer. Using the WinCC Project Duplicator is expressly forbidden. You can find more details on configuring the Windows user authorizations in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

Introduction

Once you have inserted new plant objects/pictures and tested their function on the ES, you must update the relevant AS and OS servers to make the changes available to the operator. If no changes have been made to the structure and it is possible to only compile OS changes, the OS servers can remain in runtime mode during the download procedure.
