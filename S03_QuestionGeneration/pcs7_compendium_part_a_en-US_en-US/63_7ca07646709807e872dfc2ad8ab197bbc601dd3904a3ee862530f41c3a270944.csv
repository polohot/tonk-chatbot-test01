# Naming concept

The names of IO devices and DP slaves should be based on the naming concept of a plant or plant network to allow you to quickly localize the location of a problem during maintenance. Industry-neutral as well as industry-specific names exist for this.

Industry-neutral example: 2550C01CA04

- 25: Short designation of the production facility
- 50: Name of the control room
- C01C: Name and position of the rack
- A04: Module slot

Industry-specific example based on the water industry: RN-LISA-04

Adhere to the following convention for the names of the individual process tags:

XXN_XXXX_XX

- XXN: Process step
- XXXX: Measuring principle:
- XX: Element

According to the ATV260 guideline, the name of the process step must be shortened to two characters, e.g. RB for rain overflow basin. ",How can IO devices and DP slaves be named according to the 'PCS 7 V9.0' profile to facilitate problem localization?,"Names should follow the plant or plant network's naming concept, using industry-neutral or industry-specific examples like 2550C01CA04 or RN-LISA-04.","For quick problem localization, use names based on the plant's naming concept, such as 2550C01CA04 (industry-neutral) or RN-LISA-04 (industry-specific).","Adopt naming conventions like 2550C01CA04, where segments represent facility, control room, rack position, and module slot, or RN-LISA-04 for industry-specific contexts.","The 'PCS 7 V9.0' profile recommends naming IO devices and DP slaves with industry-neutral (e.g., 2550C01CA04) or industry-specific (e.g., RN-LISA-04) names based on the plant's naming concept.","To localize problems quickly, name IO devices and DP slaves according to the plant's naming concept, exemplified by 2550C01CA04 for industry-neutral and RN-LISA-04 for industry-specific naming."
