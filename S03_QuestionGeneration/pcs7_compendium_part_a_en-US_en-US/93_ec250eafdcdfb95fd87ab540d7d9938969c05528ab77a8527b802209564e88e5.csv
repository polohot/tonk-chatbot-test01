Language settings in WinCC

There are several menus in WinCC, which you can use to set the language. The following explains the importance of the language setting.

# Menu commands in the WinCC Explorer

- ""Options > Languages"" menu: This is where you set the language for the user interfaces.
- ""Computer > Properties > Parameters"" menu: This is where you set the language for runtime. You can also set the language for printing out the project documentation in WinCC in this field.

# Menu command in the Graphics Designer

- ""View > Language"" menu: You first have to select the language for displaying pictures in runtime before configuring the pictures.

# Menu command in alarm logging

- ""View > Language"" menu:
- Display of message texts in the selected language
- The message texts need to be compiled in the text library

# Language settings for Runtime

- Button for language selection: You can set the current display language for runtime here. To do this, you need to configure all switchable parts to the respective language.

Note

WinCC is always opened from the Simatic Manager in the language which is set there. Only if WinCC is not opened from the Simatic Manager will the language correspond to the one set before the program was last exited.

# Additional information

Further instructions and information on language settings can be found in the document ""Configuring texts and languages in SIMATIC PCS 7"".

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# Principle

To ensure and check the completeness and correctness of the time synchronization settings for the system components, a separate record or documentation of these settings is recommended:

- Excel template
Using an Excel table, you can record and continually document how the time synchronization is configured for each individual component. This allows you to have an overview of all components and their relations in terms of time synchronization. You will find an example template attached to this contribution in the Industry Online Support, which you can adapt and fill out for your system configurations.
- Drawing
In addition or as an alternative to the Excel template, the settings for time synchronization can be recorded graphically. Based on a drawing of the system components used as well as their networking, arrows can be introduced, which represent the adjusted time synchronization.

Settings in the ""Time Synchronization"" editor in the OS server project

Time synchronization of the plant bus is performed via the OS server and the redundant OS partner server with the aid of the CP1613/CP1623/CP1628.

Note

If the ES does not have a CP1613/CP1623/CP1628, select the ""Display symbolic name of the access points"" option in the ""Synchronization via System Bus (Master, Slave)"" area.

Select the communication processor (CP1613/CP1623/1628) from the ""Access point 1"" drop-down list and select the ""Master"" check box.

The OS servers act as cooperative time masters, in other words, the first OS server active on the plant bus to not receive a time frame on the plant bus switches automatically to time ""master"" mode. All other OS servers on the plant bus detect the time message frame from the time master and automatically switch to time ""slave"" mode. A cooperative master does not have to belong to a redundant server.

Select the following parameters in the OS server project:

- Excel template
Using an Excel table, you can record and continually document how the time synchronization is configured for each individual component. This allows you to have an overview of all components and their relations in terms of time synchronization. You will find an example template attached to this contribution in the Industry Online Support, which you can adapt and fill out for your system configurations.

Language settings in WinCC

There are several menus in WinCC, which you can use to set the language. The following explains the importance of the language setting.

# Menu commands in the WinCC Explorer

- ""Options > Languages"" menu: This is where you set the language for the user interfaces.
- ""Computer > Properties > Parameters"" menu: This is where you set the language for runtime. You can also set the language for printing out the project documentation in WinCC in this field.

# Menu command in the Graphics Designer

- ""View > Language"" menu: You first have to select the language for displaying pictures in runtime before configuring the pictures.

# Menu command in alarm logging

- ""View > Language"" menu:
- Display of message texts in the selected language
- The message texts need to be compiled in the text library

# Language settings for Runtime

- Button for language selection: You can set the current display language for runtime here. To do this, you need to configure all switchable parts to the respective language.

Note

WinCC is always opened from the Simatic Manager in the language which is set there. Only if WinCC is not opened from the Simatic Manager will the language correspond to the one set before the program was last exited.

# Additional information

Further instructions and information on language settings can be found in the document ""Configuring texts and languages in SIMATIC PCS 7"".

Introduction

The following example shows in abbreviated form the activation of time synchronization on the OS computers in a Windows domain with a central plant clock.

As of Windows 2000 Server, all domain controllers (DC) have the same authorizations. Time synchronization must be executed by the DC which performs the role of the ""PDC emulator"" operating master.

The time signal comes from a SICLOCK central plant clock, which can be synchronized both via GPS and DCF77.

Note

You can find the configuration options available with PCS 7 (e.g. Windows workgroup/Windows domain with/without a central plant clock) and the corresponding detailed configuration instructions in the manual ""PCS 7 Time synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Language settings in WinCC

There are several menus in WinCC, which you can use to set the language. The following explains the importance of the language setting.

# Menu commands in the WinCC Explorer

- ""Options > Languages"" menu: This is where you set the language for the user interfaces.
- ""Computer > Properties > Parameters"" menu: This is where you set the language for runtime. You can also set the language for printing out the project documentation in WinCC in this field.

# Menu command in the Graphics Designer

- ""View > Language"" menu: You first have to select the language for displaying pictures in runtime before configuring the pictures.

# Menu command in alarm logging

- ""View > Language"" menu:
- Display of message texts in the selected language
- The message texts need to be compiled in the text library

# Language settings for Runtime

- Button for language selection: You can set the current display language for runtime here. To do this, you need to configure all switchable parts to the respective language.

Note

WinCC is always opened from the Simatic Manager in the language which is set there. Only if WinCC is not opened from the Simatic Manager will the language correspond to the one set before the program was last exited.

# Additional information

Further instructions and information on language settings can be found in the document ""Configuring texts and languages in SIMATIC PCS 7"".

# 10.1.7 Time synchronization

Introduction

The following example shows in abbreviated form the activation of time synchronization on the OS computers in a Windows domain with a central plant clock.

As of Windows 2000 Server, all domain controllers (DC) have the same authorizations. Time synchronization must be executed by the DC which performs the role of the ""PDC emulator"" operating master.

The time signal comes from a SICLOCK central plant clock, which can be synchronized both via GPS and DCF77.

Note

You can find the configuration options available with PCS 7 (e.g. Windows workgroup/Windows domain with/without a central plant clock) and the corresponding detailed configuration instructions in the manual ""PCS 7 Time synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

To ensure and check the completeness and correctness of the time synchronization settings for the system components, a separate record or documentation of these settings is recommended:

- Excel template
Using an Excel table, you can record and continually document how the time synchronization is configured for each individual component. This allows you to have an overview of all components and their relations in terms of time synchronization. You will find an example template attached to this contribution in the Industry Online Support, which you can adapt and fill out for your system configurations.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

When an OS project is created in the ES, the OS project editor is opened in the background and initialized with default settings.

If you need another configuration, start the OS project editor from the WinCC Explorer and configure the required project settings.

# Example OS client layout

The settings can also be modified at a later time, if necessary.

Note

Not all configuration options are available in the OS project editor in the ""Configurations that support online delta loading only"" mode. In this mode, the only settings that can be changed are those that do not require a complete download of the PCS 7 OS. To be able to make other changes, you need to switch to ""Complete configuration (loss of support for online delta loading)"" in the OS project editor in the ""General"" tab.

Language settings in WinCC

There are several menus in WinCC, which you can use to set the language. The following explains the importance of the language setting.

# Menu commands in the WinCC Explorer

- ""Options > Languages"" menu: This is where you set the language for the user interfaces.
- ""Computer > Properties > Parameters"" menu: This is where you set the language for runtime. You can also set the language for printing out the project documentation in WinCC in this field.

# Menu command in the Graphics Designer

- ""View > Language"" menu: You first have to select the language for displaying pictures in runtime before configuring the pictures.

# Menu command in alarm logging

- ""View > Language"" menu:
- Display of message texts in the selected language
- The message texts need to be compiled in the text library

# Language settings for Runtime

- Button for language selection: You can set the current display language for runtime here. To do this, you need to configure all switchable parts to the respective language.

Note

WinCC is always opened from the Simatic Manager in the language which is set there. Only if WinCC is not opened from the Simatic Manager will the language correspond to the one set before the program was last exited.

# Additional information

Further instructions and information on language settings can be found in the document ""Configuring texts and languages in SIMATIC PCS 7"".

# 10.1.7 Time synchronization

Introduction

The following example shows in abbreviated form the activation of time synchronization on the OS computers in a Windows domain with a central plant clock.

As of Windows 2000 Server, all domain controllers (DC) have the same authorizations. Time synchronization must be executed by the DC which performs the role of the ""PDC emulator"" operating master.

The time signal comes from a SICLOCK central plant clock, which can be synchronized both via GPS and DCF77.

Note

You can find the configuration options available with PCS 7 (e.g. Windows workgroup/Windows domain with/without a central plant clock) and the corresponding detailed configuration instructions in the manual ""PCS 7 Time synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# Principle

To ensure and check the completeness and correctness of the time synchronization settings for the system components, a separate record or documentation of these settings is recommended:

- Excel template
Using an Excel table, you can record and continually document how the time synchronization is configured for each individual component. This allows you to have an overview of all components and their relations in terms of time synchronization. You will find an example template attached to this contribution in the Industry Online Support, which you can adapt and fill out for your system configurations.
- Drawing
In addition or as an alternative to the Excel template, the settings for time synchronization can be recorded graphically. Based on a drawing of the system components used as well as their networking, arrows can be introduced, which represent the adjusted time synchronization.

Settings in the ""Time Synchronization"" editor in the OS server project

Time synchronization of the plant bus is performed via the OS server and the redundant OS partner server with the aid of the CP1613/CP1623/CP1628.

Note

If the ES does not have a CP1613/CP1623/CP1628, select the ""Display symbolic name of the access points"" option in the ""Synchronization via System Bus (Master, Slave)"" area.

Select the communication processor (CP1613/CP1623/1628) from the ""Access point 1"" drop-down list and select the ""Master"" check box.

The OS servers act as cooperative time masters, in other words, the first OS server active on the plant bus to not receive a time frame on the plant bus switches automatically to time ""master"" mode. All other OS servers on the plant bus detect the time message frame from the time master and automatically switch to time ""slave"" mode. A cooperative master does not have to belong to a redundant server.

Select the following parameters in the OS server project:
