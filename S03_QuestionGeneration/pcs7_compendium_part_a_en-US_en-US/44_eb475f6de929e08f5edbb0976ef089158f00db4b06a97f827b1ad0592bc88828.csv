# Using OS reference clients

OS reference clients are always used when all settings on several OS clients are identical. Each configured OS client can be used as a basis for further clients. Creation and maintenance efforts along with the project scope for operator stations are reduced considerably as a result. In the example project, the stations ""CLIENT03"" and ""CLIENT04"" should be identical to station ""CLIENT02"".
