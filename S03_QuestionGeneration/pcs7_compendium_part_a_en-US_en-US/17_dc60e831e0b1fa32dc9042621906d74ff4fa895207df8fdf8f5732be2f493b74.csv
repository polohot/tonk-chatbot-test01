Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.
