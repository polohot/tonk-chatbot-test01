- The plant designation (HID) is composed of a block name, CFC chart name and sometimes a hierarchy folder name. In principle the HID should be kept as short as possible. We recommend using CFC chart names (process tag name) that are unique throughout the project. Incorporation of the hierarchical folder names can be avoided in the HID (see section ""Make PH settings""). If the plant naming convention is to be based on additional functional factors, the hierarchy folder names can still be integrated in the HID. The length of the HID should be limited to ensure that it can be fully displayed in all OS editing windows. The number of characters in the name of the hierarchy folders should not exceed this limit.

",What is the composition of a plant designation (HID)?,"A plant designation (HID) is composed of a block name, CFC chart name, and optionally a hierarchy folder name.","The HID consists of three possible parts: block name, CFC chart name, and sometimes a hierarchy folder name.","Comprising a block name and CFC chart name, the HID may also include a hierarchy folder name, though this is optional.","An HID includes a block name and a CFC chart name, with the addition of a hierarchy folder name being optional.","Block name and CFC chart name form the core of an HID, which can be supplemented by a hierarchy folder name if necessary."
