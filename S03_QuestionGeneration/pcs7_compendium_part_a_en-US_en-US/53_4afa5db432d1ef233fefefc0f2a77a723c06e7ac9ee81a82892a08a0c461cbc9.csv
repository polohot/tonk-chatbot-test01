Using process image partitions

Note

The settings below are not required for fail-safe applications, as no process image partitions are used in them (see also ""Compendium Part B - Process Safety).

The process image is generally updated by calling the OB1 (default setting). When process image partitions are used, they are updated by calling the respective associated cyclic interrupt OB.

As a rule, we recommend the use of process image partitions for PCS 7. Otherwise, ""non-constant time response"" will occur as a result of the free cycle of OB 1. This means that the process values are not processed and updated reliably in a temporal context. The graphic below is designed to illustrate this:

① If no process image partition is configured for OB 35 (the process image is updated in OB 1 only), OB 35 is executed three times with the ""old"" process values, without having direct influence on the process.

Configuration is performed in the following three steps:

1. CPU properties:

Assign one of up to 15 free process image partitions to a cyclic interrupt OB (e.g. OB 35 – 100 ms)
2. Module properties:

Assign the module addresses to a process image partition and thereby to the desired cyclic interrupt OB
3. CFC chart:

Installation of the channel blocks in the cyclic interrupt OB which belongs to the process image partition

The process image partition is automatically updated by the cyclic interrupt OB to which it was assigned.

# ""Process image partition"" column

You have the option of selecting a separate process image partition for each cyclic interrupt used in order to guarantee a consistent signal update with the CPU at full load.

# ""Priority"" and ""Phase offset"" columns

The ""Priority"" column should not be changed for standard applications. With several cyclic interrupt OBs that are to be called at the same time, we recommend setting a phase offset for OBs with lower priority. For example, OB 38 to OB 32 are called in sequence at 1,000 ms. The execution time of the cyclic interrupts can be distributed beyond the cycle using the phase offset. The table below shows the parameter assignments for the example:

|Cyclic interrupt OB|Execution (processing portion)|Phase offset|
|---|---|---|
|OB 32|1000 ms (150 ms)|100 ms (>70+20)|
|OB 33|500 ms (70 ms)|30 ms (>20)|
|OB 34|200 ms (20 ms)|0|

# 6.1.5 Memory

Local data (priority classes)

Local data is derived from the declaration section of the logic blocks and stored centrally in the local data storage area. On the ""Memory"" tab, you can define the local data size in the work memory for each individual OB. This value must always be beyond the particular local data requirement.

Each cyclic interrupt OB is assigned a local data size by means of its priority. OB 30, for example, has the priority 7 and OB 38 the priority 15. The default setting is 2048 bytes for each cyclic interrupt OB which is adequate for typical quantities of block types. As early as the engineering phase, a check is made when compiling charts to determine whether a warning threshold (preset to 90%) is exceeded.

Using process image partitions

Note

The settings below are not required for fail-safe applications, as no process image partitions are used in them (see also ""Compendium Part B - Process Safety).

The process image is generally updated by calling the OB1 (default setting). When process image partitions are used, they are updated by calling the respective associated cyclic interrupt OB.

As a rule, we recommend the use of process image partitions for PCS 7. Otherwise, ""non-constant time response"" will occur as a result of the free cycle of OB 1. This means that the process values are not processed and updated reliably in a temporal context. The graphic below is designed to illustrate this:

① If no process image partition is configured for OB 35 (the process image is updated in OB 1 only), OB 35 is executed three times with the ""old"" process values, without having direct influence on the process.

Configuration is performed in the following three steps:

1. CPU properties:

Assign one of up to 15 free process image partitions to a cyclic interrupt OB (e.g. OB 35 – 100 ms)
2. Module properties:

Assign the module addresses to a process image partition and thereby to the desired cyclic interrupt OB
3. CFC chart:

Installation of the channel blocks in the cyclic interrupt OB which belongs to the process image partition

The process image partition is automatically updated by the cyclic interrupt OB to which it was assigned.

# ""Process image partition"" column

You have the option of selecting a separate process image partition for each cyclic interrupt used in order to guarantee a consistent signal update with the CPU at full load.

# ""Priority"" and ""Phase offset"" columns

The ""Priority"" column should not be changed for standard applications. With several cyclic interrupt OBs that are to be called at the same time, we recommend setting a phase offset for OBs with lower priority. For example, OB 38 to OB 32 are called in sequence at 1,000 ms. The execution time of the cyclic interrupts can be distributed beyond the cycle using the phase offset. The table below shows the parameter assignments for the example:

|Cyclic interrupt OB|Execution (processing portion)|Phase offset|
|---|---|---|
|OB 32|1000 ms (150 ms)|100 ms (>70+20)|
|OB 33|500 ms (70 ms)|30 ms (>20)|
|OB 34|200 ms (20 ms)|0|

# 6.1.5 Memory

Local data (priority classes)

Local data is derived from the declaration section of the logic blocks and stored centrally in the local data storage area. On the ""Memory"" tab, you can define the local data size in the work memory for each individual OB. This value must always be beyond the particular local data requirement.

Each cyclic interrupt OB is assigned a local data size by means of its priority. OB 30, for example, has the priority 7 and OB 38 the priority 15. The default setting is 2048 bytes for each cyclic interrupt OB which is adequate for typical quantities of block types. As early as the engineering phase, a check is made when compiling charts to determine whether a warning threshold (preset to 90%) is exceeded.

If the warning threshold is exceeded due to import of new block types in complex processes, increase the maximum size of the local data area (preset to 65536 for CPU 410-5H) and then increase the local data of the priority classes used.

It is also important to set the priorities 24 to 28 to a value of 2048. These contain OB 100 and the asynchronous error OBs.

Each cyclic interrupt OB is assigned a local data size by means of its priority. OB 30, for example, has the priority 7 and OB 38 the priority 15. The default setting is 2048 bytes for each cyclic interrupt OB which is adequate for typical quantities of block types. As early as the engineering phase, a check is made when compiling charts to determine whether a warning threshold (preset to 90%) is exceeded.

If the warning threshold is exceeded due to import of new block types in complex processes, increase the maximum size of the local data area (preset to 65536 for CPU 410-5H) and then increase the local data of the priority classes used.

It is also important to set the priorities 24 to 28 to a value of 2048. These contain OB 100 and the asynchronous error OBs.

Checking the local data requirement

Use the CFC editor to compare the local data requirement and amount in the CPU. Use the ""Options > Chart > Chart Reference Data"" command to open the editor in which the ""Local Data"" can be viewed. ",What is the default local data size for each cyclic interrupt OB in PCS 7?,"The default local data size for each cyclic interrupt OB is 2048 bytes, sufficient for typical block type quantities.","Each cyclic interrupt OB is initially set with a local data size of 2048 bytes, adequate for usual block type amounts.","2048 bytes is the standard local data allocation per cyclic interrupt OB, meeting the needs of common block type volumes.","In PCS 7, cyclic interrupt OBs default to 2048 bytes of local data, enough for standard block type counts.","Default setting allocates 2048 bytes of local data to each cyclic interrupt OB, suitable for typical block type quantities."

Note

A process image with the size of 1000 I/O bytes takes up 12 KBytes in the work memory. 20 KBytes are taken up in CPU firmware V6 and above. You can see an overview of the I/O address space currently in use under the HW Config menu command ""View > Address Overview…"". The highest address for inputs or outputs listed (without diagnostic addresses) must be within the configured size of the process image. The process image is required for the PCS 7 configuration because all channel blocks access a symbolic address from the process image and do not work with direct I/O access.

Using process image partitions

Note

The settings below are not required for fail-safe applications, as no process image partitions are used in them (see also ""Compendium Part B - Process Safety).

The process image is generally updated by calling the OB1 (default setting). When process image partitions are used, they are updated by calling the respective associated cyclic interrupt OB.

As a rule, we recommend the use of process image partitions for PCS 7. Otherwise, ""non-constant time response"" will occur as a result of the free cycle of OB 1. This means that the process values are not processed and updated reliably in a temporal context. The graphic below is designed to illustrate this:

① If no process image partition is configured for OB 35 (the process image is updated in OB 1 only), OB 35 is executed three times with the ""old"" process values, without having direct influence on the process.

Configuration is performed in the following three steps:

1. CPU properties:

Assign one of up to 15 free process image partitions to a cyclic interrupt OB (e.g. OB 35 – 100 ms)
2. Module properties:

Assign the module addresses to a process image partition and thereby to the desired cyclic interrupt OB
3. CFC chart:

Installation of the channel blocks in the cyclic interrupt OB which belongs to the process image partition

The process image partition is automatically updated by the cyclic interrupt OB to which it was assigned.

The executions for the 9 cyclic interrupts can be used directly in most processes. There is also the option of defining your own execution times.

The following process control distribution is a typical example for a PCS 7 plant:

- Main process with 500 ms or 1000 ms.
- Slower processes (2 s)
- Some fast processes (50 ms or 100 ms)

# ""Process image partition"" column

You have the option of selecting a separate process image partition for each cyclic interrupt used in order to guarantee a consistent signal update with the CPU at full load.

# ""Priority"" and ""Phase offset"" columns

The ""Priority"" column should not be changed for standard applications. With several cyclic interrupt OBs that are to be called at the same time, we recommend setting a phase offset for OBs with lower priority. For example, OB 38 to OB 32 are called in sequence at 1,000 ms. The execution time of the cyclic interrupts can be distributed beyond the cycle using the phase offset. The table below shows the parameter assignments for the example:

|Cyclic interrupt OB|Execution (processing portion)|Phase offset|
|---|---|---|
|OB 32|1000 ms (150 ms)|100 ms (>70+20)|
|OB 33|500 ms (70 ms)|30 ms (>20)|
