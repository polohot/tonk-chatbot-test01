# 4.2.8 Backup management

# Introduction

Creating at least one backup of the operational system partition including the PCS 7 installation and storing this in case of any potential failure is required in order to increase availability of the plant and to reduce failure times.

In connection with this a restore DVD is also supplied with the SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstation (IPC). You can find additional information in your IPC operating instructions.

PCS 7 multiprojects are archived via a SIMATIC manager function, meaning that no backup needs to be created for a data partition.
