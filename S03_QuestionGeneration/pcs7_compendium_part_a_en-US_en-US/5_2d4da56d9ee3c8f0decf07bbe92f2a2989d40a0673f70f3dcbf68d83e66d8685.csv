Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted. ",What are the main parts of the SIMATIC PCS 7 Compendium Part A?,"The main parts include Configuration guidelines, Process safety, Technical functions, Operation and maintenance, Hardware installation, and Industrial Security.","Divided into several sections, the compendium covers Configuration guidelines with a checklist, Process safety with two checklists, Technical functions detailing SFC types, Operation and maintenance including a checklist, Hardware installation with a checklist, and Industrial Security.","Configuration guidelines, Process safety, Technical functions, Operation and maintenance, Hardware installation, and Industrial Security are the key sections of the compendium.","The compendium is structured into Configuration guidelines (including a checklist), Process safety (featuring two checklists), Technical functions (with SFC types), Operation and maintenance (plus a checklist), Hardware installation (including a checklist), and Industrial Security.","Key divisions of the compendium are: Configuration guidelines with checklist, Process safety with two checklists, Technical functions covering SFC types, Operation and maintenance including checklist, Hardware installation with checklist, and Industrial Security."

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted. ",What aspects are important for the runtime of the PCS 7 application according to the 'Preparation and administration' section?,"Availability, expandability, maintainability, and legibility are crucial.","Key aspects include ensuring availability, facilitating expandability, maintaining maintainability, and achieving legibility.","The runtime depends on availability, expandability, maintainability, and legibility.","Critical for runtime are the application's availability, its expandability, maintainability, and legibility.","Availability, expandability, maintainability, and legibility are identified as vital for the PCS 7 application's runtime."
