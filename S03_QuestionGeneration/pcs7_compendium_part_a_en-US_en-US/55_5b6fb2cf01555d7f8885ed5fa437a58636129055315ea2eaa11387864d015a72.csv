# Parameters for the advanced CPU test

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

Note

You can find detailed information about link-up and update in the following manuals:

Calculating monitoring times for updating the reserve CPU

To avoid influencing the ongoing process during the critical update phase, four monitoring times are provided that can cancel the update phase where a monitoring time is exceeded. A dialog box is opened via the ""Calculate"" button where the monitoring times are calculated using the hardware configuration and the information on the user program. ",What is the consequence of not setting the ATR property to the same value for all CPUs in a system?,"It results in inconsistent message behavior for the operator, as different CPUs may handle messages differently.",Varied ATR settings across CPUs can lead to unpredictable message acknowledgment and reporting patterns.,Operators may face confusion due to disparate message handling mechanisms among CPUs.,This inconsistency undermines system reliability and operator response effectiveness.,Uniform ATR settings are crucial for coherent message management and operational clarity.

- It can cause the plant operator to stop acknowledging messages, even those which are not ""fluttering messages"". If this is the case, the operator will not realize that the event causing the message is recurring.
- The ATR property is a property of the CPU, which must be explicitly set for each CPU. If this property is not set to the same value for all CPUs, this can result in varying message behavior for the operator.
- The ALARM (SFB 33), ALARM_8 (SFB 34), and ALARM_8P (SFB 35) blocks then only report a change of signal if the previous change of signal (the previous incoming message) has been acknowledged. This property applies to all signals on these blocks, irrespective of the ""Acknowledgment required"" property in PCS 7.
- The setting can only be subsequently changed by performing a complete CPU download.
- ""Fluttering messages"" which appear during commissioning or when a process tag is faulty can also be blocked using the ""Acknowledge error"" OS function.
