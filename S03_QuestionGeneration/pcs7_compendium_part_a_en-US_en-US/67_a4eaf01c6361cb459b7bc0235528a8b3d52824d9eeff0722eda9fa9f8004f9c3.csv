# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration. ",What are the requirements for device names and IP addresses in the configuration of an IO device in the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,Device names and IP addresses must be unique within a network.,Each device name and IP address assigned to an IO device must be unique in its network.,Uniqueness is mandatory for both device names and IP addresses in the network during IO device configuration.,Ensure no duplicates exist for device names and IP addresses within the same network.,The configuration requires that every device name and IP address in the network is distinct.

# 6.6.1 ET 200M as DP slave (H system and standard AS)

Introduction

The following describes the configuration of an ET 200M station as a typical DP slave.

Note

You can find an exact step-by-step description of the configuration of an ET 200M station in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

# Procedure

1. Open the HW Config catalog (PCS 7 profile) and select the appropriate IM 153-2HF from the PROFIBUS DP/ET 200M folder.
2. Enter the DP address of the PROFIBUS DP slave in the DP slave properties. You can also select the subnet for the DP slave (here, PROFIBUS (0)). With an H system, the system automatically establishes the connection to the redundant subnet PROFIBUS (1).

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

1. For high-precision time stamping, select the ""Time-of-day synchronization"" option in the properties of the ET 200M station and set the synchronization interval to 10.00 s.
2. The ""Replace modules during operation"" option must be activated within the operating parameters where the ET 200 station is set up with an active backplane bus. For the connection to a redundant PROFIBUS, this option is preset and is grayed out because the active backplane bus is mandatory in this case.

# 6.6.2 ET 200SP HA as PROFINET device

Introduction

The following describes the configuration of a redundant ET 200SP HA on the PROFINET fieldbus.

Note

You can find an exact step-by-step description of the configuration of an ET 200SP HA station in the ""Configuration of the ET 200SP HA in PCS 7 based on different configuration examples"" application example.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

# Procedure

1. Open the catalog (PCS 7 profile) in HW Config, and select IM 155-6 PN HA Red from the PROFINET IO / I/O / ET 200SP HA folder.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

1. Confirm the prompt asking whether the device should be connected redundantly to the PROFINET system with ""Yes"".
2. Enter a unique device name for the interface module in the properties of the IO device. You can also adapt the automatically assigned IP addresses.

Note

Device names and IP addresses must be unique within a network.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

On the Redundancy tab, check whether the interface modules are connected to the correct PROFINET IO system in each case.

Note

You can find an overview of all the relevant information for realization of PROFINET solutions in SIMATIC PCS 7 in the ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082) entry.

# 6.6.3 Symbolic names of inputs and outputs

You can enter symbols directly in HW Config. The screenshot below shows a typical signal list for a chemical plant, as an example.

The symbols are added to the symbol table automatically and can then be used in the CFC.

Note

You can also import the list of hardware signals from an Excel file. This only works directly in the symbol table.

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration. ",What determines the measuring type for an analog input module as per the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,The measuring type depends on whether the transducer is powered by the module (2-wire transducer) or an external supply (4-wire transducer).,Transducer power source—module (2-wire) or external (4-wire)—determines the analog input module's measuring type.,"Measuring type is defined by the transducer's power supply: module-powered for 2-wire, externally powered for 4-wire.","For analog input modules, the measuring type varies based on the transducer being 2-wire (module-powered) or 4-wire (externally powered).",The distinction between 2-wire (module-powered) and 4-wire (externally powered) transducers sets the measuring type for analog inputs.
