The maximum amount of local data is CPU-dependent, e.g. 65536 bytes for CPU 410-5H.

# Communication resources

The CPU also determines the maximum number of possible communication jobs. A CPU 410-5H can, for example, manage a maximum of 10,000 communication jobs. Block instances of, for example, BSEND, BRCV, ALARM, ALARM_8, ALARM_8P, NOTIFY and AR_SEND occupy one communication job each.

A process object or its function block (FB) typically occupies up to 3 communication jobs per instance.

With this CPU the default setting is for 10000 communication jobs which is adequate for typical quantities of block instances. A check is made when compiling the charts during the engineering phase as to whether a warning threshold has been crossed (with a default setting of 90%).

Note

Adjust the warning level according to the planned number of PO for a CPU. Set the warning level of 2,500 communication jobs (factor 2.5) taking the example of the CPU 410-5H with System Expansion Card 1000 PO. Select the chart folder of the automation system to determine the currently used communication jobs. Via ""Extras > Charts > Chart reference data"", you can open the relevant program where you will find the ""Statistics"" view with the number of communication jobs.

Time synchronization

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external time-of-day master (""SICLOCK"" central plant clock) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this master and, therefore, identical time. As a result the synchronization type is set to: ""As slave"" for each AS in a time-synchronized PCS 7 plant in the SIMATIC mode.

Activate time synchronization in the CPU from the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab. Set the CPUs of the automation systems to function as time slaves. They receive the time from the active time master on the plant bus.

# Acknowledgment-triggered reporting (ATR)

With the ""Acknowledgment-triggered reporting of SFB 33-35"" option, it is possible to suppress the repeated reporting of ""fluttering"" signals, until an acknowledgment has been issued. This can help to make the message list clearer, as well as to take some of the strain off the communication system.

The maximum amount of local data is CPU-dependent, e.g. 65536 bytes for CPU 410-5H.

# Communication resources

The CPU also determines the maximum number of possible communication jobs. A CPU 410-5H can, for example, manage a maximum of 10,000 communication jobs. Block instances of, for example, BSEND, BRCV, ALARM, ALARM_8, ALARM_8P, NOTIFY and AR_SEND occupy one communication job each.

A process object or its function block (FB) typically occupies up to 3 communication jobs per instance.

With this CPU the default setting is for 10000 communication jobs which is adequate for typical quantities of block instances. A check is made when compiling the charts during the engineering phase as to whether a warning threshold has been crossed (with a default setting of 90%).

Note

Adjust the warning level according to the planned number of PO for a CPU. Set the warning level of 2,500 communication jobs (factor 2.5) taking the example of the CPU 410-5H with System Expansion Card 1000 PO. Select the chart folder of the automation system to determine the currently used communication jobs. Via ""Extras > Charts > Chart reference data"", you can open the relevant program where you will find the ""Statistics"" view with the number of communication jobs.

Time synchronization

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external time-of-day master (""SICLOCK"" central plant clock) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this master and, therefore, identical time. As a result the synchronization type is set to: ""As slave"" for each AS in a time-synchronized PCS 7 plant in the SIMATIC mode.
