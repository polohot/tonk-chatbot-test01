(standard slaves). This type of integration is used for PROFIBUS DP, PROFIBUS PA, FF
and HART devices. The configuration is set in HW Config. The default parameter
assignment for the device is also pre-defined in the GSD. Parameter adjustments must then
be made using a proprietary tool; alternatively, in the case of devices with EDD (Electronic

Data can only be exchanged between the master and a field device if the master is aware of
the device-specific parameters and data formats. The field device manufacturer supplies this
""knowledge"" in the form of a GSD file.

GSD files contain information about:

- Device manufacturer and identification number
- Transmission rate and bus parameters
- Volume and format of data for cyclic communication
