# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

Installed blocks for each sequence group or OB

The default limit of 50 blocks is sufficient for typical configuration cases. The monitoring is performed for:

- Blocks per sequence group (GROUP FC) or
- Blocks per TASK FC + sequence groups per TASK FC + SFCs per TASK FC

With the default setting of 50 blocks per sequence group or OB, a warning is triggered if more than 50 sequence groups (CFCs) are configured. Too many blocks per OB without using sequence groups can cause the SCL Compiler to abort, as the compiler can only create a maximum of one 64 KB FC per OB. The warning limit exists so that the 64 KB limit is not exceeded. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased.

If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the block size by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a different cyclic interrupt. You can find additional information on this topic in the FAQ ""Why does the error message 'Maximum length of code area reached (max. 64 KB)' or 'Insufficient main memory' appear when the CFC charts are compiled?""

Open the ""Settings for compile/download"" dialog box in the CFC editor via ""Options > Settings > Compile/Download"" and specify the DB and FC number ranges which should be skipped when compiling the charts.

The settings for the number ranges should be the same for all S7 programs in the multiproject. It may be necessary to change the preset range depending on the additional project-specific user libraries.

The default settings are:

Installed blocks for each sequence group or OB

The default limit of 50 blocks is sufficient for typical configuration cases. The monitoring is performed for:

- Blocks per sequence group (GROUP FC) or
- Blocks per TASK FC + sequence groups per TASK FC + SFCs per TASK FC

With the default setting of 50 blocks per sequence group or OB, a warning is triggered if more than 50 sequence groups (CFCs) are configured. Too many blocks per OB without using sequence groups can cause the SCL Compiler to abort, as the compiler can only create a maximum of one 64 KB FC per OB. The warning limit exists so that the 64 KB limit is not exceeded. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased.

If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the block size by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a different cyclic interrupt. You can find additional information on this topic in the FAQ ""Why does the error message 'Maximum length of code area reached (max. 64 KB)' or 'Insufficient main memory' appear when the CFC charts are compiled?""
