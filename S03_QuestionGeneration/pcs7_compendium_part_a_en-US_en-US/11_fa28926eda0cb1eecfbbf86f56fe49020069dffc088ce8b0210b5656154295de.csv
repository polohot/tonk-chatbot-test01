Connecting and expanding hardware

Pay attention to the operating instructions for the relevant PC hardware before unpacking. In particular compliance with the environmental conditions, the prescribed installation and correct connection of I/O and power supply devices helps to avoid faults and increase availability.

You can improve the security and stability of the PCS 7 plant by installing all PC stations in lockable control cabinets.

The following options, among others, are available to you as possible hardware expansions:

- Optional graphics expansion (dual head graphics card PCIe x16) for multi-monitor operation with up to 4 monitors (up to 2 monitors with onboard graphics)
- Acoustic or visual signal transmitter → signal module
- Acoustic signal transmitter → sound card
- Time signal, e.g. via SICLOCK time transmitter → time reception service
- Smart cards → smart card reader
