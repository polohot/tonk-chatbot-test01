",What is the requirement for the S7 program message number range in the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,It must be the same for all S7 programs in the multi-project/project.,Uniformity in message number ranges across all S7 programs within the multi-project or project is mandatory.,All S7 programs must share an identical message number range in the multi-project or project.,The same message number range is required for every S7 program in the multi-project or project.,Consistency in message number ranges across all S7 programs in the multi-project or project is essential.

- The benefit with this option: There is no additional computer required.
- Furthermore only maintenance licenses are required and no additional OS server licenses.
2. MS server as separate computer:
- Plant with three or more servers
- The benefit with this option: Clear assignment for the MS servers to the ""diagnostics area"" and not to plant areas
- More transparent handling: When the MS server is loaded, for example, this has no effect on the plant areas, which always have to be available to the operator.
- High flexibility due to separation, such as for upgrading the plant

General settings in the multiproject

The following chart shows the settings which must be checked and adapted where necessary for monitoring the components with the maintenance station:

|Setting|Location|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|Regional language and Language for display devices|SIMATIC Manager|• Set a language in which the OS project is to be operated in process control.|
|AS station name (1)|SIMATIC Manager|• <=14 characters|
|Designation of components (1)|HW Config|• No spaces|
|S7 program (1)|SIMATIC Manager|• Message number range must be the same for all S7 programs in the multi-project/project • The name of an S7 program may not be assigned twice|
|Channel blocks (1)| |The channel blocks must be at least of version V6.1. Use a corresponding library, if necessary.|
|OS compilation mode| |Area-oriented|
|Plant hierarchy setting (1)| |The settings of the plant hierarchy must be the same in all projects of the multiproject/project.|
|OS project type single station project (2)|WinCC Explorer|The single station project type must be selected in project properties.|
|Group display hierarchy (1)| |When user diagnostics is used, the group display hierarchy must be automatically created.|
