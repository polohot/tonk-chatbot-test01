# Configuring AS functions

# 8.8 Comparing projects with the Version Cross Manager (VXM)

# Functions

- Table-based engineering using CMTs
- Parameter assignment and interconnection of parameters of CMs
- Parameter assignment and interconnection of signals of CMs
- Parameter assignment of messages and alarms of CMs
- Export and import to/from Microsoft Excel
- Selective export to Excel using copy and paste
- Import to the list editor using copy and paste
- Identification of data inconsistencies during import

# Advantages

- Reduction of engineering errors
- MS Excel engineering requires no system-specific knowledge
- Export of CM-based engineering data without special tools – based on standard functions

# 8.8 Comparing projects with the Version Cross Manager (VXM)

The Version Cross Manager detects differences between the various revision levels (versions) of an engineering project. It can compare entire projects, hardware configurations, CFC/SFC charts, block types and instances, signals, run sequences, etc., with one another and thus detect any objects which are missing, which have been added, or which are different.

The import and export of project and planning data plus generation of process tags from CAx function charts are available as additional functions.

Note

The VXM process image is not updated during selective downloading of charts. An update is complete if all changed charts have been downloaded.

Usage scenarios and information on working with the Version Cross Manager can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# 8.9 Archiving/Versioning with Version Trail

The overall multiproject should be archived on a regular basis, with all projects and the master data library. If a number of changes are made during commissioning and FAT in the engineering stages, an archive/backup should be created every day. Archiving the relevant projects following each AS change download is recommended in production.

In addition to the easy archiving/retrieval via SIMATIC Manager there is also the option of versioning, creating and managing archives with the optional ""Version Trail"" package, although the archived data cannot be changed once this has been done. This means that defined archive versions can be compared with one another using the Version Cross Manager. You also have the option of setting up archiving in a time-controlled manner.

From PCS 7 V8.1 onwards, you have the option of automatic archiving after the successful downloading of the user program.

Note

# 8.9 Archiving/Versioning with Version Trail

The overall multiproject should be archived on a regular basis, with all projects and the master data library. If a number of changes are made during commissioning and FAT in the engineering stages, an archive/backup should be created every day. Archiving the relevant projects following each AS change download is recommended in production.

In addition to the easy archiving/retrieval via SIMATIC Manager there is also the option of versioning, creating and managing archives with the optional ""Version Trail"" package, although the archived data cannot be changed once this has been done. This means that defined archive versions can be compared with one another using the Version Cross Manager. You also have the option of setting up archiving in a time-controlled manner.

From PCS 7 V8.1 onwards, you have the option of automatic archiving after the successful downloading of the user program.

# Functions

- Table-based engineering using CMTs
- Parameter assignment and interconnection of parameters of CMs
- Parameter assignment and interconnection of signals of CMs
- Parameter assignment of messages and alarms of CMs
- Export and import to/from Microsoft Excel
- Selective export to Excel using copy and paste
- Import to the list editor using copy and paste
- Identification of data inconsistencies during import

# Advantages

- Reduction of engineering errors
- MS Excel engineering requires no system-specific knowledge
- Export of CM-based engineering data without special tools – based on standard functions

# 8.8 Comparing projects with the Version Cross Manager (VXM)

The Version Cross Manager detects differences between the various revision levels (versions) of an engineering project. It can compare entire projects, hardware configurations, CFC/SFC charts, block types and instances, signals, run sequences, etc., with one another and thus detect any objects which are missing, which have been added, or which are different.

The import and export of project and planning data plus generation of process tags from CAx function charts are available as additional functions.

Note

The VXM process image is not updated during selective downloading of charts. An update is complete if all changed charts have been downloaded.
