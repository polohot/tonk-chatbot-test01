They must not be used in process mode on any other operator stations and BATCH stations.","According to the guidelines, Word, Excel, and Access are permitted in process mode on specific client computers but are prohibited on other operator and BATCH stations due to potential performance issues.","The use of MS Office in process mode is limited to client computers like OS, BATCH, Maintenance, and WEB stations, with a warning about possible performance degradation. Other stations are off-limits for such use.","Only certain client computers (OS, BATCH, Maintenance, WEB) can run MS Office in process mode, albeit with possible performance hits. Usage is strictly forbidden on additional operator and BATCH stations.","Guidelines specify that while MS Office apps may operate in process mode on designated client computers, leading to sometimes notably slower performance, their use is banned on all other operator and BATCH stations."

If the installation of a computer is to be performed manually, the necessary prerequisites for the installation and the installation procedure must be observed. You can find information about this in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" documentation and in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration"" manual.

Address management

Following the PCS 7 installation, check the addresses and make any settings which may be required. Systematic assignment of the addresses at the start of the project will make configuration, commissioning, plant expansion, and maintenance easier. Record the assigned addresses in a table like the one shown below, for example, and keep them up to date:

|Name|Name|Terminal bus|Plant bus|Plant bus PC|Plant bus AS|

Setting the transmission rate and operating mode in the network

Siemens devices, including Industrial Ethernet switches (SCALANCE X) and the Industrial Ethernet CPs (CP 443-1 as of version 1EX10) are factory set for automatic detection of the parameters for transmission rate and operating mode (autosensing, autonegotiation).

Autosensing describes the property of network components to automatically interpret an incoming transmission signal. ",Why is systematic assignment of addresses important at the start of a PCS 7 project according to the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,"It simplifies configuration, commissioning, plant expansion, and maintenance.","Systematic address assignment eases the processes of setup, startup, future expansions, and upkeep.","Early and organized address allocation facilitates smoother project configuration, initiation, scaling, and servicing.","For streamlined project execution and maintenance, initial systematic address management is crucial.",Organized address assignment from the outset ensures easier management throughout the project's lifecycle.
