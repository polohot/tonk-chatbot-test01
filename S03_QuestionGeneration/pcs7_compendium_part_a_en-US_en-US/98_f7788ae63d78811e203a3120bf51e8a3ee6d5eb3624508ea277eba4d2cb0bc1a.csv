Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

# 10.3 Message system

Process control and system messages are also automatically generated by the project editor for a new project. The user does have the option of suppressing individual process control messages and assigning a message priority on the ""Message configuration"" tab, but only if the option for delta loading is disabled on the ""General"" tab, thus necessitating a complete download subsequently.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

# 10.3 Message system

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interrupt (1)|Top interrupt (1)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|White/red|
| |Bottom interrupt (2)| | | |
|Warning (2)|Top warning (19)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|Black/yellow|

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

Process control and system messages are also automatically generated by the project editor for a new project. The user does have the option of suppressing individual process control messages and assigning a message priority on the ""Message configuration"" tab, but only if the option for delta loading is disabled on the ""General"" tab, thus necessitating a complete download subsequently.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

Situation- and task-oriented process views

In addition to the process pictures predominantly oriented to the instrumentation at the ""subsystem"" level, which are created based on pipeline and instrument flow charts, you can also create information-based overview and group displays. These are specially oriented to the process control task. You can also structure the views hierarchically.

# 10.2 Visualization interface

This is implemented using the system library APL (Advanced Process Library) and the AddOn APG (Advanced Process Graphics). In this process, the AddOn APG supplies a function block, which collects the data from the AS and supplies the graphic objects provided by APG with data. It is thus possible to create overview images that represent the entire state of the process. This way the user can see whether there is a deviation from normal operation (work area) in good time. He can therefore intervene before warning or alarm messages are output.

Note

Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.
- To achieve picture opening times of less than 2 seconds do not configure more than 100 process objects in one process picture.

# 10.2.3 Block icons/User objects

Block icons are graphic objects of the ""user object"" (UDO, User-Defined Object) type, which represent a corresponding block type in the OS. Block icon templates for all block types/process tag types used in PCS 7 can be found in the *@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl* typical picture.

The graphic objects from this typical picture are used during OS compilation and inserted into the process pictures and linked to the appropriate process tag automatically in accordance with the plant hierarchy.

# 10.2.4 Custom block icons / user objects

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function uses the following template pictures:

- Template pictures created by the project engineer
- Name starts with ""@PCS7Typicals""
- Number restricted to 10
- Default template pictures from the picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
The picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" is contained in every PCS 7 OS project as standard. It contains the current block icons for PCS 7 V9.0.

Note

The original ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" file must not be changed! Changes to the original file are overwritten in the event of an update or upgrade.

User-defined template pictures must be created for customer-specific block icons. These must start in all cases with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"". The file name following this can be determined freely.

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function open all pictures with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"" and ascertains the picture priority alphabetically using the names:

- Prio 1: ""@PCS7Typicals_MyAPL.pdl"" (starting with the last picture alphabetically)
- Prio 2: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
- Prio 3: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV7.pdl""

The pictures with the highest priority are added.

The ""Create/Update Diagnostic Screens"" function uses the template pictures from ""@@MaintenanceTypicals"".

Note

If a personal template is used in the project, in which the block symbol is based on the APL, these can also be migrated when updating. When migrating, the amended properties, such as the position of the status indicator, are kept and new functions or components from the template @PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl are carried over.

The derivation of the block icons is controlled with configuration files. A user normally does not have to adapt the configuration files supplied by the system.

The following attributes of the block icons are taken into consideration in the configuration file without adaptation:

- Higher ProcessControlling
- ProcessControlling
- View Tag
- Return Path
- StandardTrend
- Format_InputValue
- Format_OutputValue
- Format_xx
- defaultPos
- leftPos

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

# 10.2 Visualization interface

When the OS project is compiled, the block icons are derived/updated from the plant hierarchy.

Note

The derivation of the block icons is controlled with configuration files. A user normally does not have to adapt the configuration files supplied by the system.

The following attributes of the block icons are taken into consideration in the configuration file without adaptation:

- Higher ProcessControlling
- ProcessControlling
- View Tag
- Return Path
- StandardTrend
- Format_InputValue
- Format_OutputValue
- Format_xx
- defaultPos
- leftPos
- topPos

If other attribute values are to be taken into account when updating the block icons, the configuration must be adapted accordingly.

You can find a detailed description of this under ""Structure of the Configuration File"" in the WinCC Information System.

# 10.2.7 Wizards

If block icons are not derived from the plant hierarchy (PH) in the SIMATIC Manager by default, various wizards are available for working with user object templates.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

# 10.3 Message system

Process control and system messages are also automatically generated by the project editor for a new project. The user does have the option of suppressing individual process control messages and assigning a message priority on the ""Message configuration"" tab, but only if the option for delta loading is disabled on the ""General"" tab, thus necessitating a complete download subsequently.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

# 10.3 Message system

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interrupt (1)|Top interrupt (1)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|White/red|
| |Bottom interrupt (2)| | | |

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

Process control and system messages are also automatically generated by the project editor for a new project. The user does have the option of suppressing individual process control messages and assigning a message priority on the ""Message configuration"" tab, but only if the option for delta loading is disabled on the ""General"" tab, thus necessitating a complete download subsequently.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

This is implemented using the system library APL (Advanced Process Library) and the AddOn APG (Advanced Process Graphics). In this process, the AddOn APG supplies a function block, which collects the data from the AS and supplies the graphic objects provided by APG with data. It is thus possible to create overview images that represent the entire state of the process. This way the user can see whether there is a deviation from normal operation (work area) in good time. He can therefore intervene before warning or alarm messages are output.

Note

Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.
- To achieve picture opening times of less than 2 seconds do not configure more than 100 process objects in one process picture.

- Name starts with ""@PCS7Typicals""
- Number restricted to 10
- Default template pictures from the picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
The picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" is contained in every PCS 7 OS project as standard. It contains the current block icons for PCS 7 V9.0.

Note

The original ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" file must not be changed! Changes to the original file are overwritten in the event of an update or upgrade.

User-defined template pictures must be created for customer-specific block icons. These must start in all cases with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"". The file name following this can be determined freely.

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function open all pictures with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"" and ascertains the picture priority alphabetically using the names:

- Prio 1: ""@PCS7Typicals_MyAPL.pdl"" (starting with the last picture alphabetically)
- Prio 2: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
- Prio 3: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV7.pdl""

The pictures with the highest priority are added.

The ""Create/Update Diagnostic Screens"" function uses the template pictures from ""@@MaintenanceTypicals"".

Note

If a personal template is used in the project, in which the block symbol is based on the APL, these can also be migrated when updating. When migrating, the amended properties, such as the position of the status indicator, are kept and new functions or components from the template @PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl are carried over.

SIMATIC PCS 7 categorizes and displays messages in different message lists, based on their status and type. The message lists below are implemented in the message line:

|Message line|Displays the latest unacknowledged message above the process overview|
|---|---|
|Incoming alarm list|Displays all unacknowledged messages|
|Acknowledged alarm list|Displays all acknowledged process messages which are still active|
|Outgoing alarm list|Displays all messages marked as ""Outgoing"", which have not been acknowledged.|
|List of pending messages|Displays acknowledged and unacknowledged messages that have not yet gone out.|
|Process alarm list|Displays all process control messages|
|Operation list|Displays all operator messages (e.g. ""A controller setpoint is set to xxx."")|
|Journal list|Displays all messages (incoming, acknowledged, and outgoing messages)|
|Hidden alarm list|Displays all active, manually hidden, and automatically hidden messages.|
|List of messages to be hidden|Display of all event messages which are hidden when they occur.|
|Lock list|Displays all messages that are locked|

Note: The list of hidden messages and the list of messages to hide are available as of PCS 7 V7.0.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

From PCS 7 V8.1, the message types adopt the properties of the message classes. The message classes remain as a higher-level element of the message types and can still be used with their group variables. ",How does the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)' describe the role of faceplates in the OS?,"Faceplates are the graphic representation of all elements in a technological block for operator control and monitoring, displayed in a separate window.","They serve as graphical interfaces for operator interaction with technological blocks, shown in distinct OS windows.","Faceplates provide visual and interactive access to block elements, facilitating operator control and monitoring in separate windows.","The role is to graphically present block elements for operator oversight and control, accessible through individual OS windows.","They act as graphical dashboards for operators to monitor and control technological blocks, appearing in dedicated OS windows."

Situation- and task-oriented process views

In addition to the process pictures predominantly oriented to the instrumentation at the ""subsystem"" level, which are created based on pipeline and instrument flow charts, you can also create information-based overview and group displays. These are specially oriented to the process control task. You can also structure the views hierarchically.

The figure below shows the hierarchy level:

This is implemented using the system library APL (Advanced Process Library) and the AddOn APG (Advanced Process Graphics). In this process, the AddOn APG supplies a function block, which collects the data from the AS and supplies the graphic objects provided by APG with data. It is thus possible to create overview images that represent the entire state of the process. This way the user can see whether there is a deviation from normal operation (work area) in good time. He can therefore intervene before warning or alarm messages are output.

Note

Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.
- To achieve picture opening times of less than 2 seconds do not configure more than 100 process objects in one process picture.

# 10.2 Visualization interface

# 10.2.4 Custom block icons / user objects

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function uses the following template pictures:

- Template pictures created by the project engineer
- Name starts with ""@PCS7Typicals""
- Number restricted to 10
- Default template pictures from the picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
The picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" is contained in every PCS 7 OS project as standard. It contains the current block icons for PCS 7 V9.0.

Note

The original ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" file must not be changed! Changes to the original file are overwritten in the event of an update or upgrade.

User-defined template pictures must be created for customer-specific block icons. These must start in all cases with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"". The file name following this can be determined freely.

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function open all pictures with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"" and ascertains the picture priority alphabetically using the names:

- Prio 1: ""@PCS7Typicals_MyAPL.pdl"" (starting with the last picture alphabetically)
- Prio 2: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
- Prio 3: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV7.pdl""

The pictures with the highest priority are added.

The ""Create/Update Diagnostic Screens"" function uses the template pictures from ""@@MaintenanceTypicals"".

Note

If a personal template is used in the project, in which the block symbol is based on the APL, these can also be migrated when updating. When migrating, the amended properties, such as the position of the status indicator, are kept and new functions or components from the template @PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl are carried over.

# 10.2.6 Creating block icons in the SIMATIC Manager

In PCS 7 the block icons/pictures are derived from the plant hierarchy (PH) by default. This is set in the SIMATIC Manager by selecting the picture property ""Derive the block icons from the plant hierarchy"". As of PCS 7 V7.0, this setting is pre-selected.

# 10.2 Visualization interface

When the OS project is compiled, the block icons are derived/updated from the plant hierarchy.

Note

The derivation of the block icons is controlled with configuration files. A user normally does not have to adapt the configuration files supplied by the system.

The following attributes of the block icons are taken into consideration in the configuration file without adaptation:

- Higher ProcessControlling
- ProcessControlling
- View Tag
- Return Path
- StandardTrend
- Format_InputValue
- Format_OutputValue
- Format_xx
- defaultPos
- leftPos
- topPos

If other attribute values are to be taken into account when updating the block icons, the configuration must be adapted accordingly.

You can find a detailed description of this under ""Structure of the Configuration File"" in the WinCC Information System.

# 10.2.7 Wizards

If block icons are not derived from the plant hierarchy (PH) in the SIMATIC Manager by default, various wizards are available for working with user object templates.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

# 10.3 Message system

Process control and system messages are also automatically generated by the project editor for a new project. The user does have the option of suppressing individual process control messages and assigning a message priority on the ""Message configuration"" tab, but only if the option for delta loading is disabled on the ""General"" tab, thus necessitating a complete download subsequently.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA 257

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interrupt (1)|Top interrupt (1)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|White/red|

# 10.2.4 Custom block icons / user objects

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function uses the following template pictures:

- Template pictures created by the project engineer
- Name starts with ""@PCS7Typicals""
- Number restricted to 10
- Default template pictures from the picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
The picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" is contained in every PCS 7 OS project as standard. It contains the current block icons for PCS 7 V9.0.

Note

The original ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" file must not be changed! Changes to the original file are overwritten in the event of an update or upgrade.

User-defined template pictures must be created for customer-specific block icons. These must start in all cases with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"". The file name following this can be determined freely.

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function open all pictures with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"" and ascertains the picture priority alphabetically using the names:

- Prio 1: ""@PCS7Typicals_MyAPL.pdl"" (starting with the last picture alphabetically)
- Prio 2: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
- Prio 3: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV7.pdl""

The pictures with the highest priority are added.

The ""Create/Update Diagnostic Screens"" function uses the template pictures from ""@@MaintenanceTypicals"".

Note

If a personal template is used in the project, in which the block symbol is based on the APL, these can also be migrated when updating. When migrating, the amended properties, such as the position of the status indicator, are kept and new functions or components from the template @PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl are carried over.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interrupt (1)|Top interrupt (1)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|White/red|
| |Bottom interrupt (2)| | | |

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

# 10.2 Visualization interface

This is implemented using the system library APL (Advanced Process Library) and the AddOn APG (Advanced Process Graphics). In this process, the AddOn APG supplies a function block, which collects the data from the AS and supplies the graphic objects provided by APG with data. It is thus possible to create overview images that represent the entire state of the process. This way the user can see whether there is a deviation from normal operation (work area) in good time. He can therefore intervene before warning or alarm messages are output.

Note

Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.
- To achieve picture opening times of less than 2 seconds do not configure more than 100 process objects in one process picture.

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window ""Properties – Message Type"".

Situation- and task-oriented process views

In addition to the process pictures predominantly oriented to the instrumentation at the ""subsystem"" level, which are created based on pipeline and instrument flow charts, you can also create information-based overview and group displays. These are specially oriented to the process control task. You can also structure the views hierarchically.

# 10.2 Visualization interface

This is implemented using the system library APL (Advanced Process Library) and the AddOn APG (Advanced Process Graphics). In this process, the AddOn APG supplies a function block, which collects the data from the AS and supplies the graphic objects provided by APG with data. It is thus possible to create overview images that represent the entire state of the process. This way the user can see whether there is a deviation from normal operation (work area) in good time. He can therefore intervene before warning or alarm messages are output.

Note

Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.
- To achieve picture opening times of less than 2 seconds do not configure more than 100 process objects in one process picture.

# 10.2.4 Custom block icons / user objects

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function uses the following template pictures:

- Template pictures created by the project engineer
- Name starts with ""@PCS7Typicals""
- Number restricted to 10
- Default template pictures from the picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
The picture ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" is contained in every PCS 7 OS project as standard. It contains the current block icons for PCS 7 V9.0.

Note

The original ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"" file must not be changed! Changes to the original file are overwritten in the event of an update or upgrade.

User-defined template pictures must be created for customer-specific block icons. These must start in all cases with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"". The file name following this can be determined freely.

The ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function open all pictures with the fixed name component ""@PCS7Typicals"" and ascertains the picture priority alphabetically using the names:

- Prio 1: ""@PCS7Typicals_MyAPL.pdl"" (starting with the last picture alphabetically)
- Prio 2: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl""
- Prio 3: ""@PCS7TypicalsAPLV7.pdl""

The pictures with the highest priority are added.

The ""Create/Update Diagnostic Screens"" function uses the template pictures from ""@@MaintenanceTypicals"".

Note

If a personal template is used in the project, in which the block symbol is based on the APL, these can also be migrated when updating. When migrating, the amended properties, such as the position of the status indicator, are kept and new functions or components from the template @PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl are carried over.

# 10.2 Visualization interface

When the OS project is compiled, the block icons are derived/updated from the plant hierarchy.

Note

The derivation of the block icons is controlled with configuration files. A user normally does not have to adapt the configuration files supplied by the system.

The following attributes of the block icons are taken into consideration in the configuration file without adaptation:

- Higher ProcessControlling
- ProcessControlling
- View Tag
- Return Path
- StandardTrend
- Format_InputValue
- Format_OutputValue
- Format_xx
- defaultPos
- leftPos
- topPos

If other attribute values are to be taken into account when updating the block icons, the configuration must be adapted accordingly.

You can find a detailed description of this under ""Structure of the Configuration File"" in the WinCC Information System.

# 10.2.7 Wizards

If block icons are not derived from the plant hierarchy (PH) in the SIMATIC Manager by default, various wizards are available for working with user object templates.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The ""User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the ""User-configurable message classes"" function, observe the information in the section ""Configuring the PCS 7 message system"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the ""Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

# 10.3 Message system

Process control and system messages are also automatically generated by the project editor for a new project. The user does have the option of suppressing individual process control messages and assigning a message priority on the ""Message configuration"" tab, but only if the option for delta loading is disabled on the ""General"" tab, thus necessitating a complete download subsequently.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of ""Emergency messages"" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate ""Highest priority alarms"" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. ""Temperature setpoint reached"").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. ""User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC""). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. ""Incorrect password"").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. ""Logon via Smart card"").
