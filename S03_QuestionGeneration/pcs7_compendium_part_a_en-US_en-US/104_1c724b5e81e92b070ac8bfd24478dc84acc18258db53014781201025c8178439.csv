# Configuring OS functions

# 10.5 PCS 7 Web option

# Requirements

The following requirements apply to using the Web solution:

- The Web solution can be implemented both in plants with a server/client structure as well as on OS single stations.
- The Web solution allows Web servers whose plants or plant areas still use a previous version of PCS 7 to also be accessed with a Web client. You will find further information on this in the FAQ ""What should you watch out for when installing the PCS 7 Web Option with respect to Web Cross Connectivity?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/92190315).
- In order to execute a process operation via faceplates, the OS hierarchy (Picture Tree) must be derived from the SIMATIC Manager plant hierarchy. At the very minimum, however, the area names used in the OS and AS must match.

# OS server load

In the case of a plant where the configuration is planned as a mixture of OS clients and Web clients, the permissible number of clients in terms of the load on the OS servers can be roughly calculated using this formula:

Number of OS clients * 2 + number of Web clients * 1 <= 60

# Notes on configuration

The following points must be taken into account when configuring the Web solution:

- Where there is an existing server/client structure, the number of times run through to publish images, scripts and status displays for the Web server is based on the number of server packages downloaded (publishing operations: number of server packages + Web server).
- The ""WebNavigator"" option must be enabled and selected as the startup screen ""@Screen.pd_"" for the respective user in the User Administrator of the Web server.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.5 PCS 7 Web option

# Requirements

The following requirements apply to using the Web solution:

- The Web solution can be implemented both in plants with a server/client structure as well as on OS single stations.
- The Web solution allows Web servers whose plants or plant areas still use a previous version of PCS 7 to also be accessed with a Web client. You will find further information on this in the FAQ ""What should you watch out for when installing the PCS 7 Web Option with respect to Web Cross Connectivity?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/92190315).
- In order to execute a process operation via faceplates, the OS hierarchy (Picture Tree) must be derived from the SIMATIC Manager plant hierarchy. At the very minimum, however, the area names used in the OS and AS must match.

# OS server load

In the case of a plant where the configuration is planned as a mixture of OS clients and Web clients, the permissible number of clients in terms of the load on the OS servers can be roughly calculated using this formula:

Number of OS clients * 2 + number of Web clients * 1 <= 60

# Notes on configuration

The following points must be taken into account when configuring the Web solution:

- Where there is an existing server/client structure, the number of times run through to publish images, scripts and status displays for the Web server is based on the number of server packages downloaded (publishing operations: number of server packages + Web server).
- The ""WebNavigator"" option must be enabled and selected as the startup screen ""@Screen.pd_"" for the respective user in the User Administrator of the Web server.
",Where can additional information about the Information Server be found?,Manuals and application examples on Siemens' support website provide further details.,Look for the 'Information Server 2014: Operating instructions' manual and related application examples online.,"Siemens' support site offers manuals and examples for installation, operation, and reporting.","Additional resources include operating instructions, installation notes, and practical application examples.","For more info, consult the provided manuals and examples on the Siemens support portal."
