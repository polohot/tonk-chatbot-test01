# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

The opening of the VIGV. The turbine efficiency remains essentially constant due to the small change in turbine entry temperature.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. This is shown in Fig. ",What maintains the constant power demand from the generator despite changes in ambient pressure?,The turbine power decreases with ambient pressure to maintain constant power demand from the generator.,"To keep the generator's power demand constant, the turbine power adjusts in response to ambient pressure changes.",A decrease in turbine power corresponding to ambient pressure changes ensures the generator's power demand remains steady.,"The system compensates for ambient pressure variations by adjusting turbine power, thus maintaining constant generator demand.",Constant power demand from the generator is maintained by the turbine power decreasing as ambient pressure drops.

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.
