In the context of the gas turbine cycle, the pressure ratio (Pr) is defined as the ratio of the pressure at the compressor exit (P₂) to the pressure at the compressor inlet (P₁). As the pressure ratio increases, several key factors come into play:

1. **Compressor Work (Wc)**: The work done by the compressor is given by the equation \( W_c = c_p(T_2 - T_1) \). As the pressure ratio increases, the temperature at the compressor exit (T₂) also increases, leading to higher compressor work.

The net specific work can be analyzed by considering the balance between these two components.

4. **Comparison with Other Cycles**: The specific work output can also be compared with other cycles, such as the simple cycle and the conventional regenerative cycle. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio can be illustrated graphically, showing how the specific work output changes with different pressure ratios and how it compares to other cycle configurations.
