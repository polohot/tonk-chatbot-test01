Although the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, increases due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, a decrease in T₁ results in the reduction in the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The decrease in the temperatures T₃ and T₂ results in a decrease in turbine blade metal temperature, even during the period of VIGV operation (Fig. 16.17).

# 16.3.2 Trends in pressure

During the period when the VIGV is fully opened, the increase in compressor ratio results in an increase in compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 16.18, which shows the trends in pressures during this transient. It is also observed that the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure decrease during the period of VIGV closure. This is due to the decrease in compressor pressure ratio when the VIGV closes. The figure also shows the trends in the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures. Since it has been assumed that the inlet and exhaust losses are small, the trends for these two pressures are almost superimposed.
