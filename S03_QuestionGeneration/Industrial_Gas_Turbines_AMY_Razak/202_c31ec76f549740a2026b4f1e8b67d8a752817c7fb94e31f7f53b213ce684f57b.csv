1. **Decrease in Speed and Turbine Entry Temperature**: As the ambient temperature decreases, the speed and turbine entry temperature also decrease. Lower turbine entry temperatures typically lead to reduced formation of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which are temperature-dependent emissions.

2. **Decrease in Compressor Discharge Temperature**: The reduction in compressor discharge temperature results in a lower cooling air temperature, which can further contribute to lower emissions.

3. **Decrease in Exhaust Gas Temperature**: The decrease in exhaust gas temperature during the transient conditions also plays a role in reducing emissions, as lower exhaust temperatures can lead to lower levels of pollutants such as NOₓ and carbon monoxide (CO).

Overall, these factors combined lead to a reduction in emissions during the ambient temperature transient in gas turbines."
