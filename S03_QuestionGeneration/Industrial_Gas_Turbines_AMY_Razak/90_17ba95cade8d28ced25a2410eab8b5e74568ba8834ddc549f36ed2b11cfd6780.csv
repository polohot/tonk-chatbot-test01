The structure of a tubular combustor consists of a flame tube that is enclosed within a cylindrical liner. This configuration is designed to facilitate the combustion process while maintaining efficient thermal management.

### Structure:
- **Flame Tube**: The central component where the combustion occurs. It is designed to withstand high temperatures generated during the combustion of fuel and air.
- **Cylindrical Liner**: Surrounds the flame tube and serves to contain the combustion process while providing structural integrity.
- **Interconnector or Crossover Tubes**: These are additional tubes that connect multiple flame tubes within the combustor. Their primary function is to ensure that the flame can spread between the cans during the start-up phase, allowing all combustors to ignite effectively.

### Function:
- **Fuel Injection**: Fuel is injected into the flame tube, where it mixes with air to form a combustible mixture.
- **Combustion Process**: The combustion begins in the flame tube, where the fuel is oxidized, producing high-temperature gases.
- **Heat Management**: The design allows for efficient heat transfer and cooling, as the air that bypasses the combustion process (dilution air) helps cool the flame tube. Additional cooling techniques, such as film cooling, may be employed to protect the combustor structure from extreme temperatures.
- **Flexibility in Fuel Types**: Tubular combustors can accommodate a variety of fuel types, making them suitable for different operational requirements.

1. **Efficiency and Power Output**: The temperature of the gases affects the overall efficiency of the turbine. Higher temperatures generally lead to greater thermal efficiency and power output, as the turbine can extract more energy from the high-temperature gases. However, if the temperature is too high, it can lead to material stress and potential damage to the turbine components.

2. **Material Limitations**: Turbines are designed to operate within specific temperature limits. If the combustion gases are too hot when they enter the turbine, it can exceed the material limits of the turbine blades and other components, leading to failure or reduced lifespan. Therefore, maintaining an optimal gas temperature is essential for reliable operation.

3. **Combustion Efficiency**: The temperature of the gases is also indicative of combustion efficiency. If the gases are too hot, it may suggest incomplete combustion or the presence of pollutants, which can indicate inefficiencies in the combustion process. This can lead to increased emissions and operational costs.

4. **Cooling Requirements**: The dilution zone plays a crucial role in reducing the temperature of the combustion gases before they enter the turbine. By mixing the combustion gases with additional air, the dilution zone ensures that the gas temperature is satisfactory for turbine operation. A well-designed dilution zone can help achieve a balance between optimal performance and the thermal limits of the turbine.

In summary, the temperature of combustion gases entering the turbine significantly influences turbine performance by affecting efficiency, material integrity, combustion efficiency, and cooling requirements.

In contrast, industrial combustors resemble larger single tubular combustors, focusing on efficiency and versatility for various fuel types.

Overall, the combustion process in industrial gas turbines is characterized by a greater emphasis on fuel flexibility and efficiency, while aero-derivative gas turbines prioritize compactness and performance."
