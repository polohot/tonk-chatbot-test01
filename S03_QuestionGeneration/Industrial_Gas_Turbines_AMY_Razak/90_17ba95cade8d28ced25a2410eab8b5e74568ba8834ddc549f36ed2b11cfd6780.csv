Fuel into fine droplets. Combustion begins at a region near the eye of the vortex and the fuel resides in the vortex for a sufficient length of time (residence time), until the fuel is oxidised, liberating heat.

# 6.2.3 Intermediate zone

The equivalence ratio, φ, in the primary zone will be close to unity and the temperature of the gases and products of combustion leaving the primary zone is in the order of 2000 K. At these temperatures, the products will contain radicals and fuel species in the form of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and CO, due to dissociation of carbon dioxide and water.

Should the combustion gases pass directly to the dilution zone, they will be quenched, due to the large amount of air being added in the dilution zone. They will appear as pollutants and give an indication of poor combustion inefficiency. The intermediate zone reduces these species or radicals by introducing small amounts of air, which lower the temperature and encourage the formation of carbon dioxide and water vapour.

# 6.2.4 Dilution zone

The combustion gases leaving the intermediate zone will be at about 1800 K and may still be too hot for the turbine downstream. The dilution zone must ensure that the gas temperature entering the turbine is satisfactory and it achieves this by admitting the remaining air to mix with the products of combustion.

The pattern factor is a parameter that is used to determine how well the mixing has been performed by the dilution zone and is defined as:

PF = Tmax - T2 / T2 - T1 [6.8]

# 146 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

where

PF is the pattern factor

Tₘₐₓ is the maximum or peak temperature

T₂ is the average exit temperature

T₁ is the combustion inlet temperature and usually corresponds to the compressor discharge temperature.

A satisfactory value for the pattern factor is about 0.2. A typical temperature distribution at the exit of the combustion chamber is shown in Fig. 6.9.

# 6.3 Combustor cooling

The high temperatures that prevail within the combustion chamber during combustion subject the flame tube to a very high temperature. Although the air that bypasses the combustion process (dilution air) provides some cooling of the flame tube, additional cooling is normally required. Additional flame tube cooling is provided by including a number of slots along the flame tube to generate a film of cooling air over the flame tube material in a manner similar to that discussed in turbine film cooling. This film of cooling air acts as a thermal barrier and protects the flame tube, as is shown in Fig. 6.10.

Techniques such as transpiration cooling, as discussed in Section 5.7.4, can be applied to flame tube cooling. Such cooling techniques result in a significant reduction in cooling air requirements and it is claimed that about a 50% reduction in flame tube-cooling air occurs with such techniques.

# 6.4 Types of gas turbine combustor

There are two categories of engines having different requirements regarding combustor size and weight. These are the aero-derivatives and the industrial gas turbines. As the name implies, the aero-derivatives are derived from aircraft engines where size and weight are of paramount importance. Industrial gas turbines are less concerned with size and weight issues but may be required to burn a wide range of fuel types.

# 6.4.1 Aero-derivative combustors

There are generally three types of combustors used in aero-derivatives, known as the tubular, tuboannular and the annular types.

# Tubular combustor

The tubular combustor, also known as the ‘can’ combustor, consists of a flame tube enclosed within a cylindrical liner positioned concentrically, as shown in Fig. 6.11. The interconnector or crossover tubes are required to ensure light-up of all the cans during start-up by the flame spreading via the interconnector tubes. The cylindrical liner ensures that each flame tube has its own combustion air supply. These combustors were heavy and incurred a high pressure loss, eventually giving rise to the tuboannular combustor. Tubular combustors were used in the very early gas turbines such as the Whittle W2B and the Jumo 004.

# Tuboannular combustor

The main difference between the tubular and tuboannular (can-annular) combustor is the common air supply to all the flame tubes. This is achieved by placing the flame tubes within a single cylindrical casing as shown in Fig. 6.12.

Such an arrangement results in a more compact and lighter combustor. However, it is more difficult to achieve a satisfactory distribution of combustion air between the flame tubes when compared with the tubular combustor. Nonetheless, tuboannular combustors have been used extensively.

# Annular combustor

In the annular combustor an annular flame tube is placed within the cylindrical liner or casing. The annular combustor has a lower pressure loss and is more compact, compared with the tuboannular design. Its use is now widespread in aero-engines and as a result it is also found in aero-derived gas turbines. Figure 6.13 shows a cross-sectional view of an annular combustor.

# Gas turbine combustion

# 6.4.2 Industrial combustors

Industrial gas turbines are not normally constrained by size and weight and may need to burn a wider range of fuels varying from natural gas to treated crude oil. As a result, industrial combustors tend to be much larger than aero-derived gas turbine combustors.

The increase in combustor size results in an increase in the residence time, enabling lower quality fuels to be burnt. Also, the gas velocities are lower and this results in lower pressure losses in the combustor. Their appearance is similar to a large single tubular combustor as shown in Fig. ",How is fuel injected and mixed in a typical gas turbine combustor as described in the book 'Gas turbine combustion'?,"Fuel is injected through a nozzle directed towards the eye of the vortex, where it mixes with swirl air to break up into fine droplets.","In 'Gas turbine combustion', the process involves fuel injection towards the vortex's eye, mixing with swirl air for fine droplet formation.","The book describes fuel injection via a nozzle aimed at the vortex eye, facilitating mixing with swirl air to create fine fuel droplets.","Mixing in a gas turbine combustor, per the book, starts with fuel injection towards the vortex eye, aided by swirl air for droplet breakup.","According to 'Gas turbine combustion', fuel and air mix after injection towards the vortex eye, with swirl air assisting in breaking the fuel into droplets."

Such an arrangement results in a more compact and lighter combustor. However, it is more difficult to achieve a satisfactory distribution of combustion air between the flame tubes when compared with the tubular combustor. Nonetheless, tuboannular combustors have been used extensively.

# Annular combustor

In the annular combustor an annular flame tube is placed within the cylindrical liner or casing. The annular combustor has a lower pressure loss and is more compact, compared with the tuboannular design. Its use is now widespread in aero-engines and as a result it is also found in aero-derived gas turbines. Figure 6.13 shows a cross-sectional view of an annular combustor.

# Gas turbine combustion

# 6.4.2 Industrial combustors

Industrial gas turbines are not normally constrained by size and weight and may need to burn a wider range of fuels varying from natural gas to treated crude oil. As a result, industrial combustors tend to be much larger than aero-derived gas turbine combustors.

The increase in combustor size results in an increase in the residence time, enabling lower quality fuels to be burnt. Also, the gas velocities are lower and this results in lower pressure losses in the combustor. Their appearance is similar to a large single tubular combustor as shown in Fig. ",What cooling techniques are applied to the flame tube in gas turbine combustors based on 'Gas turbine combustion'?,"Cooling slots create an air film over the flame tube, acting as a thermal barrier.","Techniques like film cooling and transpiration cooling are used, reducing cooling air needs by up to 50%.",The book mentions slots for cooling air films and advanced methods like transpiration cooling for efficiency.,Flame tube cooling involves air films from slots and can include transpiration cooling for less air usage.,"According to 'Gas turbine combustion', cooling combines air films and transpiration methods to protect the flame tube."

Fuel into fine droplets. Combustion begins at a region near the eye of the vortex and the fuel resides in the vortex for a sufficient length of time (residence time), until the fuel is oxidised, liberating heat.

# 6.2.3 Intermediate zone

The equivalence ratio, φ, in the primary zone will be close to unity and the temperature of the gases and products of combustion leaving the primary zone is in the order of 2000 K. At these temperatures, the products will contain radicals and fuel species in the form of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and CO, due to dissociation of carbon dioxide and water.

Should the combustion gases pass directly to the dilution zone, they will be quenched, due to the large amount of air being added in the dilution zone. They will appear as pollutants and give an indication of poor combustion inefficiency. The intermediate zone reduces these species or radicals by introducing small amounts of air, which lower the temperature and encourage the formation of carbon dioxide and water vapour.

# 6.2.4 Dilution zone

The combustion gases leaving the intermediate zone will be at about 1800 K and may still be too hot for the turbine downstream. The dilution zone must ensure that the gas temperature entering the turbine is satisfactory and it achieves this by admitting the remaining air to mix with the products of combustion.

The pattern factor is a parameter that is used to determine how well the mixing has been performed by the dilution zone and is defined as:

PF = Tmax - T2 / T2 - T1 [6.8]

# 146 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

where

PF is the pattern factor

Tₘₐₓ is the maximum or peak temperature

T₂ is the average exit temperature

T₁ is the combustion inlet temperature and usually corresponds to the compressor discharge temperature.

A satisfactory value for the pattern factor is about 0.2. A typical temperature distribution at the exit of the combustion chamber is shown in Fig. 6.9.

# 6.3 Combustor cooling

The high temperatures that prevail within the combustion chamber during combustion subject the flame tube to a very high temperature. Although the air that bypasses the combustion process (dilution air) provides some cooling of the flame tube, additional cooling is normally required. Additional flame tube cooling is provided by including a number of slots along the flame tube to generate a film of cooling air over the flame tube material in a manner similar to that discussed in turbine film cooling. This film of cooling air acts as a thermal barrier and protects the flame tube, as is shown in Fig. 6.10.

Techniques such as transpiration cooling, as discussed in Section 5.7.4, can be applied to flame tube cooling. Such cooling techniques result in a significant reduction in cooling air requirements and it is claimed that about a 50% reduction in flame tube-cooling air occurs with such techniques.

# 6.4 Types of gas turbine combustor

There are two categories of engines having different requirements regarding combustor size and weight. These are the aero-derivatives and the industrial gas turbines. As the name implies, the aero-derivatives are derived from aircraft engines where size and weight are of paramount importance. Industrial gas turbines are less concerned with size and weight issues but may be required to burn a wide range of fuel types.

# 6.4.1 Aero-derivative combustors

There are generally three types of combustors used in aero-derivatives, known as the tubular, tuboannular and the annular types.

# Tubular combustor

The tubular combustor, also known as the ‘can’ combustor, consists of a flame tube enclosed within a cylindrical liner positioned concentrically, as shown in Fig. 6.11. The interconnector or crossover tubes are required to ensure light-up of all the cans during start-up by the flame spreading via the interconnector tubes. The cylindrical liner ensures that each flame tube has its own combustion air supply. These combustors were heavy and incurred a high pressure loss, eventually giving rise to the tuboannular combustor. Tubular combustors were used in the very early gas turbines such as the Whittle W2B and the Jumo 004.

# Tuboannular combustor

The main difference between the tubular and tuboannular (can-annular) combustor is the common air supply to all the flame tubes. This is achieved by placing the flame tubes within a single cylindrical casing as shown in Fig. 6.12.

There are two categories of engines having different requirements regarding combustor size and weight. These are the aero-derivatives and the industrial gas turbines. As the name implies, the aero-derivatives are derived from aircraft engines where size and weight are of paramount importance. Industrial gas turbines are less concerned with size and weight issues but may be required to burn a wide range of fuel types.

# 6.4.1 Aero-derivative combustors

There are generally three types of combustors used in aero-derivatives, known as the tubular, tuboannular and the annular types.

# Tubular combustor

The tubular combustor, also known as the ‘can’ combustor, consists of a flame tube enclosed within a cylindrical liner positioned concentrically, as shown in Fig. 6.11. The interconnector or crossover tubes are required to ensure light-up of all the cans during start-up by the flame spreading via the interconnector tubes. The cylindrical liner ensures that each flame tube has its own combustion air supply. These combustors were heavy and incurred a high pressure loss, eventually giving rise to the tuboannular combustor. Tubular combustors were used in the very early gas turbines such as the Whittle W2B and the Jumo 004.

# Tuboannular combustor

The main difference between the tubular and tuboannular (can-annular) combustor is the common air supply to all the flame tubes. This is achieved by placing the flame tubes within a single cylindrical casing as shown in Fig. 6.12.

Such an arrangement results in a more compact and lighter combustor. However, it is more difficult to achieve a satisfactory distribution of combustion air between the flame tubes when compared with the tubular combustor. Nonetheless, tuboannular combustors have been used extensively.

# Annular combustor

In the annular combustor an annular flame tube is placed within the cylindrical liner or casing. The annular combustor has a lower pressure loss and is more compact, compared with the tuboannular design. Its use is now widespread in aero-engines and as a result it is also found in aero-derived gas turbines. Figure 6.13 shows a cross-sectional view of an annular combustor.

# 6.4.2 Industrial combustors

Industrial gas turbines are not normally constrained by size and weight and may need to burn a wider range of fuels varying from natural gas to treated crude oil. As a result, industrial combustors tend to be much larger than aero-derived gas turbine combustors.

The increase in combustor size results in an increase in the residence time, enabling lower quality fuels to be burnt. Also, the gas velocities are lower and this results in lower pressure losses in the combustor. Their appearance is similar to a large single tubular combustor as shown in Fig. ",Why are industrial gas turbine combustors larger than aero-derivative ones as per 'Gas turbine combustion'?,Larger size accommodates longer residence times and lower gas velocities for diverse fuel combustion.,The book states size increases allow burning lower quality fuels and reduce pressure losses.,Industrial combustors' size supports varied fuel use and efficient combustion with lower velocities.,"Increased dimensions enable longer fuel residence and lower speeds, essential for industrial fuel ranges.","In 'Gas turbine combustion', larger combustors handle diverse fuels and minimize pressure losses effectively."
