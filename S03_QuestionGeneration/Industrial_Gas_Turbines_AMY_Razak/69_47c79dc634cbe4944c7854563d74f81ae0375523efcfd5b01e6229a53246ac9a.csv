For a given temperature rise across the compressor, the pressure ratio will fall as the efficiency decreases, due to stalling, and this is illustrated in Fig. 4.17, which represents the compression process on a temperature–entropy diagram. If the efficiency loss due to stalling is sufficiently large and rapid, the required discharge pressure cannot be delivered by the compressor and the flow will reverse. This flow reversal results in a reduction in pressure in the discharge volume downstream of the compressor.

When the pressure in the discharge volume has decayed sufficiently, the flow will progress in the normal direction and the discharge pressure will build up (normal compression). Since the conditions that gave rise to the flow reversal in the first instance still prevail, the flow can again break down (separate) and reverse.

Such a reversal can occur at quite a high frequency, referred to as surge, and can be very destructive to a compressor. This recompression of what is effectively the compressor discharge air, already at a high temperature, results in very high compressor discharge temperatures during surge. Figure 4.18 shows the stable and unstable, or surge, part of the characteristic for a given compressor speed.

Referring to Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in compressor inlet flow when operating on the stable part of the compressor characteristic (point A) would increase the compressor pressure ratio to point B and thus increase the discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure would increase the flow through the throttle valve (shown in Figure 4.16). The increase in flow through the valve will work its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and increase the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point to return to A. Thus, the compressor is stable when operating in the region where the gradient of the pressure ratio–flow curve is negative.

While operating at point C in Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in flow would decrease the compressor pressure ratio and hence discharge pressure (point D), which will decrease the flow through the valve. The decrease in the valve flow would make its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and further reduce the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point further to the left of the characteristic. Hence, this part of the compressor characteristic is unstable and would lead to compressor surge. The fall in compressor pressure ratio with flow in the unstable part of the characteristic, and degree of the instability, depend on the loss in compressor efficiency due.

The flow reversal due to surge can be cyclic, as implied above, or settling or even stable. Greitzer 7 showed that a single parameter can determine the nature of surge. What is often referred to as the Greitzer B parameter is given by:

B = U vp
2c Ac × Lc

where

- U = blade velocity
- c = velocity of sound
- vp = downstream volume
- Ac = compressor mean flow area
- Lc = compressor length.

When the values for B are in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are cyclic and a deep surge cycle occurs at the higher values of B. When values for B are in the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the surge cycles are settling and give rise to stable (non-oscillatory) conditions at the lower value.

# 4.9 Compressor annulus geometry

The above discussion describes a single compressor stage and the only reference that has been made to the annulus geometry is the work done factor, which primarily accounts for the boundary layer growth along the compressor annulus. The computation of the stage aerodynamic performance was carried out at the blade mid-height. Figures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21 show possible annulus designs where the blade mid-height is rising, staying constant or falling.

The effect of increasing deflection, axial velocity and blade velocity can also be considered on the velocity triangles. It is observed that increase in deflection and axial velocity always increases the change in whirl or tangential velocity, resulting in an increase in stage loading coefficient, whereas increase in blade velocity results in a decrease in stage loading coefficient.

Blade mid-height

It has been stated that the stage-loading coefficient should be about 0.5 or less, if good stage efficiency is to be achieved.

A rising line design as shown in Fig. 4.19 will increase the blade velocity at blade mid-height as we progress along the compressor annulus. Therefore, the stage loading will decrease, continuously improving the stage efficiency. Alternatively, for a given stage-loading coefficient, a higher stage pressure ratio can be obtained as we progress along the annulus with the rising line annulus design. This reduces the number of stages required to achieve a given overall pressure ratio. It may be thought that one always designs for a rising line for the annulus (Fig. 4.19). However, at the high pressure stages, the blade height will reduce and the boundary layer will increase, covering most of the blade height (i.e. the work done factor will decrease), particularly for high pressure ratio compressors.

A parameter that is used to ensure that the boundary layer does not affect the performance of a compressor stage is the hub-to-tip ratio. This ratio should not be allowed to exceed 0.9. For a given overall pressure ratio, the hub-to-tip ratio of the last stage is influenced by the hub-to-tip ratio of the first stage. Due to mechanical stress considerations of the first stage, its hub-to-tip ratio is not allowed to fall below 0.5. For a given compressor stage, the axial velocity, Va, and discharge density, ρ, which is determined by the discharge pressure and temperature, are largely fixed by the compressor blading (velocity triangles). For an air mass flow rate, m, the continuity equation m = ρ × Va × A tells us the flow area; A must be fixed and corresponds to the annulus (flow) area as shown by Fig. 4.22.

# Compressors

# 4.22 Typical compressor annulus and flow area.

The flow area is given by:

A = πhRₜ ⌈ Rᵗ + 1⌉ [4.8]

where

- h is the blade height and equals Rₜ – Rₕ
- Rₕ = hub radius
- Rₜ = tip radius.

For a falling blade mid-height design, the hub radius is fixed (Fig. 4.21 above). For a given flow area, a reduction in the tip radius will result in a larger blade height, h, compared with a rising line design (Equation 4.8). Therefore, using a falling line design for the annulus, as shown in Fig. 4.21 above, for the HP stages, will result in less of the blade height being covered by the boundary layer. Hence, a higher work done factor is achieved. In other words, the hub-to-tip ratio will decrease. However, the velocity at blade mid-height is falling and a trade-off between lower blade velocity and hub-to-tip ratio should be made in order to optimise the compressor design. A general strategy is to design LP stages using a rising blade mid-height design followed by the IP stages using a constant blade mid-height design. Then the HP stage uses a falling blade mid-height design, particularly for very high pressure ratio compressors.

# 4.10 Compressor off-design operation

As discussed, an axial compressor comprises many stages. The satisfactory operation of the compressor at off-design conditions is of paramount importance because these conditions are often encountered during start-up and low power operation. Compressor stall and surge may be encountered under such conditions and may make starting the engine or low power operation impossible without some remedial action being taken.

As the compressor speed decreases, the airflow rate falls off more rapidly than the speed. The effect of this is to choke the HP or back stages of the

# 116 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

compressor due to the increase in the axial velocity needed in these stages to maintain the flow through the compressor. This forces the LP or front stages to stall and may eventually lead to surge. Conversely, at high operating speeds, the LP or front stages will choke forcing the HP or back compressor stages to stall. The running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 4.23, may intersect the surge line at low compressor speeds, making starting or low power operation impossible. This running line is also dependent on the swallowing capacity of the turbines and will be discussed later. Means to remedy this problem involve incorporating blow-off valves, multi-spooled compressor and variable geometry stators. A detailed discussion on off-design performance of compressors may be found in Saravanamuttoo, 1 et al. Harman,8 and Walsh and Fletcher.9

# 4.10.1 Blow-off valves

Blow-off valves are positioned at some intermediate stages and may be opened during starting. Blow-off reduces the flow to the HP or back stages, thereby reducing the velocity, hence preventing these stages from choking. Therefore, blow-off prevents the front stages from stalling and prevents compressor surge during start-up or low power operation. Blow-off also moves the running line away from the surge line, further improving the surge margin. However, blow-off is a waste of energy and should normally be used as little as possible.

# 4.10.2 Multi-spool compressors

As the compressor design pressure ratios increase, the difference in density at the HP stages at design and off-design conditions will increase. This increases the probability of the LP stages stalling and surging during start-up and at low speed operation. The use of blow-off has been discussed as a means of alleviating such surge conditions.

The compressor may also be divided into two or more spools, where there is no mechanical linkage between the two compressor spools, although an aerodynamic link exists between them. Such a division of the compressor results in the HP spool running at a higher speed than the LP spool. Therefore, at low LP compressor speed operation, the HP spool can run at a higher speed and pass more flow through the HP spool. This prevents the choke conditions in the HP stages that give rise to the surge problems at start-up and low speed operations. Clearly, blow-off can be eliminated or reduced during start-up and low speed operation, so improving the performance of the gas turbine under these conditions. Schematic representations of gas turbines using such compressor configurations are shown in Figs. ",What is the effect of compressor efficiency on the pressure ratio according to the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,"For a given temperature rise across the compressor, the pressure ratio will fall as the efficiency decreases due to stalling.","Decreased efficiency, caused by stalling, leads to a reduction in the compressor's pressure ratio for a specific temperature increase.","The pressure ratio drops with declining efficiency, a consequence of stalling, as illustrated in the temperature–entropy diagram.","Stalling reduces compressor efficiency, which in turn lowers the pressure ratio for a set temperature rise.","As efficiency diminishes due to stalling, the compressor's ability to maintain its pressure ratio for a given temperature rise is compromised."

compressor due to the increase in the axial velocity needed in these stages to maintain the flow through the compressor. This forces the LP or front stages to stall and may eventually lead to surge. Conversely, at high operating speeds, the LP or front stages will choke forcing the HP or back compressor stages to stall. The running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 4.23, may intersect the surge line at low compressor speeds, making starting or low power operation impossible. This running line is also dependent on the swallowing capacity of the turbines and will be discussed later. Means to remedy this problem involve incorporating blow-off valves, multi-spooled compressor and variable geometry stators. A detailed discussion on off-design performance of compressors may be found in Saravanamuttoo, 1 et al. Harman,8 and Walsh and Fletcher.9

# 4.10.1 Blow-off valves

Blow-off valves are positioned at some intermediate stages and may be opened during starting. Blow-off reduces the flow to the HP or back stages, thereby reducing the velocity, hence preventing these stages from choking. Therefore, blow-off prevents the front stages from stalling and prevents compressor surge during start-up or low power operation. Blow-off also moves the running line away from the surge line, further improving the surge margin. However, blow-off is a waste of energy and should normally be used as little as possible.

# 4.10.2 Multi-spool compressors

As the compressor design pressure ratios increase, the difference in density at the HP stages at design and off-design conditions will increase. This increases the probability of the LP stages stalling and surging during start-up and at low speed operation. The use of blow-off has been discussed as a means of alleviating such surge conditions.

The compressor may also be divided into two or more spools, where there is no mechanical linkage between the two compressor spools, although an aerodynamic link exists between them. Such a division of the compressor results in the HP spool running at a higher speed than the LP spool. Therefore, at low LP compressor speed operation, the HP spool can run at a higher speed and pass more flow through the HP spool. This prevents the choke conditions in the HP stages that give rise to the surge problems at start-up and low speed operations. Clearly, blow-off can be eliminated or reduced during start-up and low speed operation, so improving the performance of the gas turbine under these conditions. Schematic representations of gas turbines using such compressor configurations are shown in Figs. ",What determines the nature of surge in a compressor according to Greitzer in 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,"The nature of surge is determined by the Greitzer B parameter, which depends on blade velocity, sound velocity, downstream volume, compressor mean flow area, and compressor length.","Greitzer's B parameter, a function of several compressor characteristics, dictates whether surge cycles are cyclic, settling, or stable.","Surge's characteristics—whether cyclic, settling, or stable—are influenced by the value of the Greitzer B parameter.","The Greitzer B parameter, calculated from specific compressor metrics, determines the surge behavior, ranging from cyclic to stable conditions.","Depending on the Greitzer B parameter's value, surge can manifest as cyclic, settling, or stable flow reversals in the compressor."

For a given temperature rise across the compressor, the pressure ratio will fall as the efficiency decreases, due to stalling, and this is illustrated in Fig. 4.17, which represents the compression process on a temperature–entropy diagram. If the efficiency loss due to stalling is sufficiently large and rapid, the required discharge pressure cannot be delivered by the compressor and the flow will reverse. This flow reversal results in a reduction in pressure in the discharge volume downstream of the compressor.

When the pressure in the discharge volume has decayed sufficiently, the flow will progress in the normal direction and the discharge pressure will build up (normal compression). Since the conditions that gave rise to the flow reversal in the first instance still prevail, the flow can again break down (separate) and reverse.

Such a reversal can occur at quite a high frequency, referred to as surge, and can be very destructive to a compressor. This recompression of what is effectively the compressor discharge air, already at a high temperature, results in very high compressor discharge temperatures during surge. Figure 4.18 shows the stable and unstable, or surge, part of the characteristic for a given compressor speed.

Referring to Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in compressor inlet flow when operating on the stable part of the compressor characteristic (point A) would increase the compressor pressure ratio to point B and thus increase the discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure would increase the flow through the throttle valve (shown in Figure 4.16). The increase in flow through the valve will work its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and increase the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point to return to A. Thus, the compressor is stable when operating in the region where the gradient of the pressure ratio–flow curve is negative.

While operating at point C in Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in flow would decrease the compressor pressure ratio and hence discharge pressure (point D), which will decrease the flow through the valve. The decrease in the valve flow would make its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and further reduce the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point further to the left of the characteristic. Hence, this part of the compressor characteristic is unstable and would lead to compressor surge. The fall in compressor pressure ratio with flow in the unstable part of the characteristic, and degree of the instability, depend on the loss in compressor efficiency due.

The flow reversal due to surge can be cyclic, as implied above, or settling or even stable. Greitzer 7 showed that a single parameter can determine the nature of surge. What is often referred to as the Greitzer B parameter is given by:

B = U vp
2c Ac × Lc

where

- U = blade velocity
- c = velocity of sound
- vp = downstream volume
- Ac = compressor mean flow area
- Lc = compressor length.

When the values for B are in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are cyclic and a deep surge cycle occurs at the higher values of B. When values for B are in the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the surge cycles are settling and give rise to stable (non-oscillatory) conditions at the lower value.

# 4.9 Compressor annulus geometry

The above discussion describes a single compressor stage and the only reference that has been made to the annulus geometry is the work done factor, which primarily accounts for the boundary layer growth along the compressor annulus. The computation of the stage aerodynamic performance was carried out at the blade mid-height. Figures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21 show possible annulus designs where the blade mid-height is rising, staying constant or falling.

The effect of increasing deflection, axial velocity and blade velocity can also be considered on the velocity triangles. It is observed that increase in deflection and axial velocity always increases the change in whirl or tangential velocity, resulting in an increase in stage loading coefficient, whereas increase in blade velocity results in a decrease in stage loading coefficient.

Blade mid-height

It has been stated that the stage-loading coefficient should be about 0.5 or less, if good stage efficiency is to be achieved.

A rising line design as shown in Fig. 4.19 will increase the blade velocity at blade mid-height as we progress along the compressor annulus. Therefore, the stage loading will decrease, continuously improving the stage efficiency. Alternatively, for a given stage-loading coefficient, a higher stage pressure ratio can be obtained as we progress along the annulus with the rising line annulus design. This reduces the number of stages required to achieve a given overall pressure ratio. It may be thought that one always designs for a rising line for the annulus (Fig. 4.19). However, at the high pressure stages, the blade height will reduce and the boundary layer will increase, covering most of the blade height (i.e. the work done factor will decrease), particularly for high pressure ratio compressors.

A parameter that is used to ensure that the boundary layer does not affect the performance of a compressor stage is the hub-to-tip ratio. This ratio should not be allowed to exceed 0.9. For a given overall pressure ratio, the hub-to-tip ratio of the last stage is influenced by the hub-to-tip ratio of the first stage. Due to mechanical stress considerations of the first stage, its hub-to-tip ratio is not allowed to fall below 0.5. For a given compressor stage, the axial velocity, Va, and discharge density, ρ, which is determined by the discharge pressure and temperature, are largely fixed by the compressor blading (velocity triangles). For an air mass flow rate, m, the continuity equation m = ρ × Va × A tells us the flow area; A must be fixed and corresponds to the annulus (flow) area as shown by Fig. 4.22.

# Compressors

# 4.22 Typical compressor annulus and flow area.

The flow area is given by:

A = πhRₜ ⌈ Rᵗ + 1⌉ [4.8]

where

- h is the blade height and equals Rₜ – Rₕ
- Rₕ = hub radius
- Rₜ = tip radius.

For a falling blade mid-height design, the hub radius is fixed (Fig. 4.21 above). For a given flow area, a reduction in the tip radius will result in a larger blade height, h, compared with a rising line design (Equation 4.8). Therefore, using a falling line design for the annulus, as shown in Fig. 4.21 above, for the HP stages, will result in less of the blade height being covered by the boundary layer. Hence, a higher work done factor is achieved. In other words, the hub-to-tip ratio will decrease. However, the velocity at blade mid-height is falling and a trade-off between lower blade velocity and hub-to-tip ratio should be made in order to optimise the compressor design. A general strategy is to design LP stages using a rising blade mid-height design followed by the IP stages using a constant blade mid-height design. Then the HP stage uses a falling blade mid-height design, particularly for very high pressure ratio compressors.

# 4.10 Compressor off-design operation

As discussed, an axial compressor comprises many stages. The satisfactory operation of the compressor at off-design conditions is of paramount importance because these conditions are often encountered during start-up and low power operation. Compressor stall and surge may be encountered under such conditions and may make starting the engine or low power operation impossible without some remedial action being taken.

As the compressor speed decreases, the airflow rate falls off more rapidly than the speed. The effect of this is to choke the HP or back stages of the

It has been stated that the stage-loading coefficient should be about 0.5 or less, if good stage efficiency is to be achieved.

A rising line design as shown in Fig. 4.19 will increase the blade velocity at blade mid-height as we progress along the compressor annulus. Therefore, the stage loading will decrease, continuously improving the stage efficiency. Alternatively, for a given stage-loading coefficient, a higher stage pressure ratio can be obtained as we progress along the annulus with the rising line annulus design. This reduces the number of stages required to achieve a given overall pressure ratio. It may be thought that one always designs for a rising line for the annulus (Fig. 4.19). However, at the high pressure stages, the blade height will reduce and the boundary layer will increase, covering most of the blade height (i.e. the work done factor will decrease), particularly for high pressure ratio compressors.

A parameter that is used to ensure that the boundary layer does not affect the performance of a compressor stage is the hub-to-tip ratio. This ratio should not be allowed to exceed 0.9. For a given overall pressure ratio, the hub-to-tip ratio of the last stage is influenced by the hub-to-tip ratio of the first stage. Due to mechanical stress considerations of the first stage, its hub-to-tip ratio is not allowed to fall below 0.5. For a given compressor stage, the axial velocity, Va, and discharge density, ρ, which is determined by the discharge pressure and temperature, are largely fixed by the compressor blading (velocity triangles). For an air mass flow rate, m, the continuity equation m = ρ × Va × A tells us the flow area; A must be fixed and corresponds to the annulus (flow) area as shown by Fig. 4.22.

# Compressors

# 4.22 Typical compressor annulus and flow area.

The flow area is given by:

A = πhRₜ ⌈ Rᵗ + 1⌉ [4.8]

where

- h is the blade height and equals Rₜ – Rₕ
- Rₕ = hub radius
- Rₜ = tip radius.

For a falling blade mid-height design, the hub radius is fixed (Fig. 4.21 above). For a given flow area, a reduction in the tip radius will result in a larger blade height, h, compared with a rising line design (Equation 4.8). Therefore, using a falling line design for the annulus, as shown in Fig. 4.21 above, for the HP stages, will result in less of the blade height being covered by the boundary layer. Hence, a higher work done factor is achieved. In other words, the hub-to-tip ratio will decrease. However, the velocity at blade mid-height is falling and a trade-off between lower blade velocity and hub-to-tip ratio should be made in order to optimise the compressor design. A general strategy is to design LP stages using a rising blade mid-height design followed by the IP stages using a constant blade mid-height design. Then the HP stage uses a falling blade mid-height design, particularly for very high pressure ratio compressors.

# 4.10 Compressor off-design operation

As discussed, an axial compressor comprises many stages. The satisfactory operation of the compressor at off-design conditions is of paramount importance because these conditions are often encountered during start-up and low power operation. Compressor stall and surge may be encountered under such conditions and may make starting the engine or low power operation impossible without some remedial action being taken.

As the compressor speed decreases, the airflow rate falls off more rapidly than the speed. The effect of this is to choke the HP or back stages of the

# 116 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

compressor due to the increase in the axial velocity needed in these stages to maintain the flow through the compressor. This forces the LP or front stages to stall and may eventually lead to surge. Conversely, at high operating speeds, the LP or front stages will choke forcing the HP or back compressor stages to stall. The running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 4.23, may intersect the surge line at low compressor speeds, making starting or low power operation impossible. This running line is also dependent on the swallowing capacity of the turbines and will be discussed later. Means to remedy this problem involve incorporating blow-off valves, multi-spooled compressor and variable geometry stators. A detailed discussion on off-design performance of compressors may be found in Saravanamuttoo, 1 et al. Harman,8 and Walsh and Fletcher.9

# 4.10.1 Blow-off valves

Blow-off valves are positioned at some intermediate stages and may be opened during starting. Blow-off reduces the flow to the HP or back stages, thereby reducing the velocity, hence preventing these stages from choking. Therefore, blow-off prevents the front stages from stalling and prevents compressor surge during start-up or low power operation. Blow-off also moves the running line away from the surge line, further improving the surge margin. However, blow-off is a waste of energy and should normally be used as little as possible.

# 4.10.2 Multi-spool compressors

As the compressor design pressure ratios increase, the difference in density at the HP stages at design and off-design conditions will increase. This increases the probability of the LP stages stalling and surging during start-up and at low speed operation. The use of blow-off has been discussed as a means of alleviating such surge conditions.

The compressor may also be divided into two or more spools, where there is no mechanical linkage between the two compressor spools, although an aerodynamic link exists between them. Such a division of the compressor results in the HP spool running at a higher speed than the LP spool. Therefore, at low LP compressor speed operation, the HP spool can run at a higher speed and pass more flow through the HP spool. This prevents the choke conditions in the HP stages that give rise to the surge problems at start-up and low speed operations. Clearly, blow-off can be eliminated or reduced during start-up and low speed operation, so improving the performance of the gas turbine under these conditions. Schematic representations of gas turbines using such compressor configurations are shown in Figs. ",What is the significance of the hub-to-tip ratio in compressor design as mentioned in 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,The hub-to-tip ratio should not exceed 0.9 to prevent the boundary layer from affecting stage performance.,Maintaining a hub-to-tip ratio below 0.9 is essential to minimize boundary layer impact on compressor stage performance.,"A hub-to-tip ratio exceeding 0.9 can lead to boundary layer issues, adversely affecting the compressor stage's efficiency.","To ensure optimal performance, the hub-to-tip ratio in compressor design must be kept under 0.9.","The compressor's efficiency is safeguarded by adhering to a hub-to-tip ratio limit of 0.9, preventing boundary layer dominance."

For a given temperature rise across the compressor, the pressure ratio will fall as the efficiency decreases, due to stalling, and this is illustrated in Fig. 4.17, which represents the compression process on a temperature–entropy diagram. If the efficiency loss due to stalling is sufficiently large and rapid, the required discharge pressure cannot be delivered by the compressor and the flow will reverse. This flow reversal results in a reduction in pressure in the discharge volume downstream of the compressor.

When the pressure in the discharge volume has decayed sufficiently, the flow will progress in the normal direction and the discharge pressure will build up (normal compression). Since the conditions that gave rise to the flow reversal in the first instance still prevail, the flow can again break down (separate) and reverse.

# 112 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Such a reversal can occur at quite a high frequency, referred to as surge, and can be very destructive to a compressor. This recompression of what is effectively the compressor discharge air, already at a high temperature, results in very high compressor discharge temperatures during surge. Figure 4.18 shows the stable and unstable, or surge, part of the characteristic for a given compressor speed.

Referring to Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in compressor inlet flow when operating on the stable part of the compressor characteristic (point A) would increase the compressor pressure ratio to point B and thus increase the discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure would increase the flow through the throttle valve (shown in Figure 4.16). The increase in flow through the valve will work its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and increase the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point to return to A. Thus, the compressor is stable when operating in the region where the gradient of the pressure ratio–flow curve is negative.

While operating at point C in Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in flow would decrease the compressor pressure ratio and hence discharge pressure (point D), which will decrease the flow through the valve. The decrease in the valve flow would make its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and further reduce the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point further to the left of the characteristic. Hence, this part of the compressor characteristic is unstable and would lead to compressor surge. The fall in compressor pressure ratio with flow in the unstable part of the characteristic, and degree of the instability, depend on the loss in compressor efficiency due.

to stalling as discussed, the volumes associated with the compressor, and the discharge or downstream ducting. The flow reversal due to surge can be cyclic, as implied above, or settling or even stable. Greitzer 7 showed that a single parameter can determine the nature of surge. What is often referred to as the Greitzer B parameter is given by:

B = U vp
2c Ac × Lc

where

- U = blade velocity
- c = velocity of sound
- vp = downstream volume
- Ac = compressor mean flow area
- Lc = compressor length.

When the values for B are in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are cyclic and a deep surge cycle occurs at the higher values of B. When values for B are in the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the surge cycles are settling and give rise to stable (non-oscillatory) conditions at the lower value.

# 4.9 Compressor annulus geometry

The above discussion describes a single compressor stage and the only reference that has been made to the annulus geometry is the work done factor, which primarily accounts for the boundary layer growth along the compressor annulus. The computation of the stage aerodynamic performance was carried out at the blade mid-height. Figures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21 show possible annulus designs where the blade mid-height is rising, staying constant or falling.

The effect of increasing deflection, axial velocity and blade velocity can also be considered on the velocity triangles. It is observed that increase in deflection and axial velocity always increases the change in whirl or tangential velocity, resulting in an increase in stage loading coefficient, whereas increase in blade velocity results in a decrease in stage loading coefficient.

Referring to Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in compressor inlet flow when operating on the stable part of the compressor characteristic (point A) would increase the compressor pressure ratio to point B and thus increase the discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure would increase the flow through the throttle valve (shown in Figure 4.16). The increase in flow through the valve will work its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and increase the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point to return to A. Thus, the compressor is stable when operating in the region where the gradient of the pressure ratio–flow curve is negative.

While operating at point C in Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in flow would decrease the compressor pressure ratio and hence discharge pressure (point D), which will decrease the flow through the valve. The decrease in the valve flow would make its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and further reduce the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point further to the left of the characteristic. Hence, this part of the compressor characteristic is unstable and would lead to compressor surge. The fall in compressor pressure ratio with flow in the unstable part of the characteristic, and degree of the instability, depend on the loss in compressor efficiency due.

to stalling as discussed, the volumes associated with the compressor, and the discharge or downstream ducting. The flow reversal due to surge can be cyclic, as implied above, or settling or even stable. Greitzer 7 showed that a single parameter can determine the nature of surge. What is often referred to as the Greitzer B parameter is given by:

B = U vp
2c Ac × Lc

where

- U = blade velocity
- c = velocity of sound
- vp = downstream volume
- Ac = compressor mean flow area
- Lc = compressor length.

When the values for B are in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are cyclic and a deep surge cycle occurs at the higher values of B. When values for B are in the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the surge cycles are settling and give rise to stable (non-oscillatory) conditions at the lower value.

# 4.9 Compressor annulus geometry

The above discussion describes a single compressor stage and the only reference that has been made to the annulus geometry is the work done factor, which primarily accounts for the boundary layer growth along the compressor annulus. The computation of the stage aerodynamic performance was carried out at the blade mid-height. Figures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21 show possible annulus designs where the blade mid-height is rising, staying constant or falling.

The effect of increasing deflection, axial velocity and blade velocity can also be considered on the velocity triangles. It is observed that increase in deflection and axial velocity always increases the change in whirl or tangential velocity, resulting in an increase in stage loading coefficient, whereas increase in blade velocity results in a decrease in stage loading coefficient.

Blade mid-height

It has been stated that the stage-loading coefficient should be about 0.5 or less, if good stage efficiency is to be achieved.

A rising line design as shown in Fig. 4.19 will increase the blade velocity at blade mid-height as we progress along the compressor annulus. Therefore, the stage loading will decrease, continuously improving the stage efficiency. Alternatively, for a given stage-loading coefficient, a higher stage pressure ratio can be obtained as we progress along the annulus with the rising line annulus design. This reduces the number of stages required to achieve a given overall pressure ratio. It may be thought that one always designs for a rising line for the annulus (Fig. 4.19). However, at the high pressure stages, the blade height will reduce and the boundary layer will increase, covering most of the blade height (i.e. the work done factor will decrease), particularly for high pressure ratio compressors.

A parameter that is used to ensure that the boundary layer does not affect the performance of a compressor stage is the hub-to-tip ratio. This ratio should not be allowed to exceed 0.9. For a given overall pressure ratio, the hub-to-tip ratio of the last stage is influenced by the hub-to-tip ratio of the first stage. Due to mechanical stress considerations of the first stage, its hub-to-tip ratio is not allowed to fall below 0.5. For a given compressor stage, the axial velocity, Va, and discharge density, ρ, which is determined by the discharge pressure and temperature, are largely fixed by the compressor blading (velocity triangles). For an air mass flow rate, m, the continuity equation m = ρ × Va × A tells us the flow area; A must be fixed and corresponds to the annulus (flow) area as shown by Fig. 4.22.

# Compressors

# 4.22 Typical compressor annulus and flow area.

The flow area is given by:

A = πhRₜ ⌈ Rᵗ + 1⌉ [4.8]

where

- h is the blade height and equals Rₜ – Rₕ
- Rₕ = hub radius
- Rₜ = tip radius.

For a falling blade mid-height design, the hub radius is fixed (Fig. 4.21 above). For a given flow area, a reduction in the tip radius will result in a larger blade height, h, compared with a rising line design (Equation 4.8). Therefore, using a falling line design for the annulus, as shown in Fig. 4.21 above, for the HP stages, will result in less of the blade height being covered by the boundary layer. Hence, a higher work done factor is achieved. In other words, the hub-to-tip ratio will decrease. However, the velocity at blade mid-height is falling and a trade-off between lower blade velocity and hub-to-tip ratio should be made in order to optimise the compressor design. A general strategy is to design LP stages using a rising blade mid-height design followed by the IP stages using a constant blade mid-height design. Then the HP stage uses a falling blade mid-height design, particularly for very high pressure ratio compressors.

# 4.10 Compressor off-design operation

As discussed, an axial compressor comprises many stages. The satisfactory operation of the compressor at off-design conditions is of paramount importance because these conditions are often encountered during start-up and low power operation. Compressor stall and surge may be encountered under such conditions and may make starting the engine or low power operation impossible without some remedial action being taken.

As the compressor speed decreases, the airflow rate falls off more rapidly than the speed. The effect of this is to choke the HP or back stages of the

# 116 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

compressor due to the increase in the axial velocity needed in these stages to maintain the flow through the compressor. This forces the LP or front stages to stall and may eventually lead to surge. Conversely, at high operating speeds, the LP or front stages will choke forcing the HP or back compressor stages to stall. The running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 4.23, may intersect the surge line at low compressor speeds, making starting or low power operation impossible. This running line is also dependent on the swallowing capacity of the turbines and will be discussed later. Means to remedy this problem involve incorporating blow-off valves, multi-spooled compressor and variable geometry stators. A detailed discussion on off-design performance of compressors may be found in Saravanamuttoo, 1 et al. Harman,8 and Walsh and Fletcher.9

# 4.10.1 Blow-off valves

Blow-off valves are positioned at some intermediate stages and may be opened during starting. Blow-off reduces the flow to the HP or back stages, thereby reducing the velocity, hence preventing these stages from choking. Therefore, blow-off prevents the front stages from stalling and prevents compressor surge during start-up or low power operation. Blow-off also moves the running line away from the surge line, further improving the surge margin. However, blow-off is a waste of energy and should normally be used as little as possible.

# 4.10.2 Multi-spool compressors

As the compressor design pressure ratios increase, the difference in density at the HP stages at design and off-design conditions will increase. This increases the probability of the LP stages stalling and surging during start-up and at low speed operation. The use of blow-off has been discussed as a means of alleviating such surge conditions.

The compressor may also be divided into two or more spools, where there is no mechanical linkage between the two compressor spools, although an aerodynamic link exists between them. Such a division of the compressor results in the HP spool running at a higher speed than the LP spool. Therefore, at low LP compressor speed operation, the HP spool can run at a higher speed and pass more flow through the HP spool. This prevents the choke conditions in the HP stages that give rise to the surge problems at start-up and low speed operations. Clearly, blow-off can be eliminated or reduced during start-up and low speed operation, so improving the performance of the gas turbine under these conditions. Schematic representations of gas turbines using such compressor configurations are shown in Figs. ",How do blow-off valves improve compressor performance during start-up according to 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,"Blow-off valves reduce flow to HP stages during start-up, preventing choking and stalling in LP stages, thus avoiding surge.","By decreasing flow to HP stages, blow-off valves prevent choking and subsequent LP stage stalling, enhancing start-up performance.","During start-up, blow-off valves mitigate HP stage choking and LP stage stalling, thereby preventing surge.","Blow-off valves enhance start-up by reducing HP stage flow, which prevents choking and LP stage stalling, averting surge.","The use of blow-off valves at start-up lowers HP stage flow, preventing choke conditions and LP stage stall, thus avoiding surge."

For a given temperature rise across the compressor, the pressure ratio will fall as the efficiency decreases, due to stalling, and this is illustrated in Fig. 4.17, which represents the compression process on a temperature–entropy diagram. If the efficiency loss due to stalling is sufficiently large and rapid, the required discharge pressure cannot be delivered by the compressor and the flow will reverse. This flow reversal results in a reduction in pressure in the discharge volume downstream of the compressor.

When the pressure in the discharge volume has decayed sufficiently, the flow will progress in the normal direction and the discharge pressure will build up (normal compression). Since the conditions that gave rise to the flow reversal in the first instance still prevail, the flow can again break down (separate) and reverse.

Such a reversal can occur at quite a high frequency, referred to as surge, and can be very destructive to a compressor. This recompression of what is effectively the compressor discharge air, already at a high temperature, results in very high compressor discharge temperatures during surge. Figure 4.18 shows the stable and unstable, or surge, part of the characteristic for a given compressor speed.

Referring to Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in compressor inlet flow when operating on the stable part of the compressor characteristic (point A) would increase the compressor pressure ratio to point B and thus increase the discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure would increase the flow through the throttle valve (shown in Figure 4.16). The increase in flow through the valve will work its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and increase the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point to return to A. Thus, the compressor is stable when operating in the region where the gradient of the pressure ratio–flow curve is negative.

While operating at point C in Fig. 4.18, a small reduction in flow would decrease the compressor pressure ratio and hence discharge pressure (point D), which will decrease the flow through the valve. The decrease in the valve flow would make its way upstream of the compressor during the transient and further reduce the compressor inlet flow, thus forcing the operating point further to the left of the characteristic. Hence, this part of the compressor characteristic is unstable and would lead to compressor surge. The fall in compressor pressure ratio with flow in the unstable part of the characteristic, and degree of the instability, depend on the loss in compressor efficiency due.
