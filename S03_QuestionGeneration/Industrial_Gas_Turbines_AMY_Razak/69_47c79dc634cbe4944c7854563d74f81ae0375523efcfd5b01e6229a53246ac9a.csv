As the efficiency decreases, the pressure ratio falls, which can lead to the compressor being unable to deliver the required discharge pressure. If the efficiency loss is significant and rapid, it can cause flow reversal, resulting in a reduction in pressure in the discharge volume downstream of the compressor."

When this flow reversal happens, the pressure in the discharge volume downstream of the compressor decreases. Once the pressure has decayed sufficiently, the flow can resume in the normal direction, allowing the discharge pressure to build up again. However, if the conditions that initially caused the flow reversal persist, the flow may break down and reverse again, leading to further fluctuations in discharge pressure. This cycle can result in unstable operation and potentially damaging surge conditions in the compressor."

Specifically, if the compressor is operating at a point where the gradient of the pressure ratio–flow curve is negative (such as point C in Fig. 4.18), a small reduction in flow will decrease the compressor pressure ratio and hence the discharge pressure. This decrease in discharge pressure leads to a reduction in flow through the throttle valve, which further decreases the compressor inlet flow, pushing the operating point further left on the characteristic curve and potentially resulting in surge.

Additionally, surge can occur when the efficiency of the compressor decreases due to stalling, which can lead to flow reversal. The cyclic nature of surge can be influenced by the Greitzer B parameter, with values in the range of 0.8 to 5 indicating cyclic surge cycles, while values between 0.45 and 0.6 suggest settling surge cycles that may lead to stable conditions."

If there is a small reduction in the compressor inlet flow while operating at a stable point (such as point A), the compressor pressure ratio will increase, leading to an increase in discharge pressure (moving to point B). This increase in discharge pressure results in a higher flow through the throttle valve. The increased flow through the valve then travels upstream to the compressor, enhancing the compressor inlet flow and pushing the operating point back to the stable region (point A). Thus, in this stable region, the compressor is able to self-correct and maintain stable operation, as the gradient of the pressure ratio-flow curve is negative."

This change leads to a further decrease in flow through the throttle valve. The reduced flow through the valve propagates upstream to the compressor, resulting in an additional reduction in the compressor inlet flow. Consequently, the operating point moves further to the left on the characteristic curve, exacerbating the instability and potentially leading to compressor surge."

Specifically:

- When the B parameter is in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are cyclic, meaning that the compressor experiences repetitive surge events. At the higher values within this range, a deep surge cycle occurs.
- Conversely, when the B parameter falls within the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the surge cycles are settling, which leads to stable (non-oscillatory) conditions. In this case, the compressor does not experience the same level of oscillation or instability.

Thus, the Greitzer B parameter serves as a critical indicator of how the compressor will behave under varying conditions, influencing whether it will experience cyclic surges or settle into stable operation."

1. **Surge Risk**: The compressor is prone to surge, which is a condition where the flow reverses due to a drop in efficiency. This can occur at high frequencies and can be destructive to the compressor.

2. **Increased Discharge Temperatures**: During surge conditions, the recompression of already high-temperature discharge air can result in very high compressor discharge temperatures, potentially damaging the compressor and associated components.

3. **Instability in Operation**: A small reduction in flow can lead to a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and discharge pressure, causing further reductions in flow through the throttle valve. This creates a feedback loop that exacerbates the instability, pushing the operating point further left on the characteristic curve.

4. **Loss of Efficiency**: Operating in this region typically indicates a loss of efficiency, which can lead to increased operational costs and reduced performance of the compressor.

5. **Potential for Damage**: The cyclic or settling nature of surge can lead to mechanical stress and fatigue on the compressor components, increasing the likelihood of failure and necessitating more frequent maintenance or replacement.

Overall, operating in the unstable region of the compressor characteristic curve poses significant risks to both the performance and longevity of the compressor system."

When the compressor is operating on the stable part of its characteristic curve (as illustrated in Fig. 4.18), a small reduction in compressor inlet flow leads to an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, which in turn raises the discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure results in a higher flow through the throttle valve. The increased flow through the valve then works its way upstream to the compressor, boosting the inlet flow and forcing the operating point to return to its original stable position. Thus, the compressor remains stable when operating in this region where the gradient of the pressure ratio-flow curve is negative."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,What factors contribute to the compressor's stability when operating in the stable region of the pressure ratio-flow curve?,"The stability of the compressor when operating in the stable region of the pressure ratio-flow curve is influenced by several factors:

1. **Pressure Ratio-Flow Curve Gradient**: The compressor is stable when operating in the region where the gradient of the pressure ratio-flow curve is negative. This means that a small reduction in compressor inlet flow will lead to an increase in the compressor pressure ratio and, consequently, an increase in discharge pressure.

2. **Inlet Flow Response**: In the stable region, an increase in discharge pressure results in an increased flow through the throttle valve. This increased flow works its way upstream to the compressor, enhancing the compressor inlet flow and pushing the operating point back to a stable position.

3. **Compressor Efficiency**: The efficiency of the compressor plays a critical role. Higher efficiency reduces the likelihood of stalling, which can lead to instability. The loss of efficiency due to factors like stalling can push the operating point into an unstable region.

4. **Operating Point Location**: The specific operating point on the pressure ratio-flow curve also affects stability. Points like A and B, which are on the stable part of the characteristic, demonstrate that small perturbations in flow do not lead to significant instability.

5. **Compressor Design Parameters**: Factors such as blade velocity (U), velocity of sound (c), downstream volume (vp), compressor mean flow area (Ac), and compressor length (Lc) as encapsulated in the Greitzer B parameter also influence stability. Values of B in the appropriate range indicate stable operation.

In summary, the stability of the compressor in the stable region is primarily determined by the negative gradient of the pressure ratio-flow curve, the response of the inlet flow to changes in discharge pressure, the efficiency of the compressor, the specific operating point, and key design parameters."

In the context provided, the diagram illustrates the effects of efficiency loss due to stalling on the discharge pressure of the compressor. 

Key points regarding its significance include:

1. **Efficiency Representation**: The diagram differentiates between high-efficiency (unstalled) and low-efficiency (stalled) compression processes, allowing for a clear comparison of performance under varying operational conditions.

2. **Irreversible Compression**: It highlights the paths of irreversible compression, showing how the temperature and entropy change during the compression process, which is crucial for analyzing energy losses and the overall effectiveness of the compressor.

3. **Flow Reversal Insight**: The diagram aids in understanding the conditions that lead to flow reversal and surge, which can be detrimental to compressor operation. It illustrates how efficiency losses can lead to a decrease in discharge pressure and subsequent flow instability.

4. **Operational Stability**: By mapping out stable and unstable regions of compressor operation, the temperature-entropy diagram helps identify conditions that maintain stable performance versus those that may lead to surge, thus guiding operational adjustments to prevent damage.

Overall, the temperature-entropy diagram serves as a critical tool for engineers and operators to analyze and optimize compressor performance, ensuring efficient and stable operation."

This is because the flow reversal results in the recompression of air that is already at a high temperature. As the compressor operates in this unstable state, the discharge temperatures can reach very high levels due to the combination of the high temperature of the discharged air and the effects of the surge."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,What role does the compressor annulus geometry play in the overall efficiency of the compressor?,"The compressor annulus geometry plays a significant role in the overall efficiency of the compressor by influencing the boundary layer growth along the annulus. The geometry affects how air flows through the compressor, impacting factors such as pressure loss, flow separation, and the development of stall conditions. A well-designed annulus can minimize adverse effects like boundary layer thickening, which can lead to increased efficiency and stability in the compression process. Conversely, poor annulus geometry can contribute to inefficiencies, increased stalling, and ultimately affect the compressor's performance and reliability."

According to the information provided, the difference between cyclic and settling surge cycles is primarily based on the value of the B parameter:

1. **Cyclic Surge Cycles**: When the B parameter values are in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are characterized as cyclic. In this scenario, the compressor experiences oscillations, leading to repeated cycles of surge. At higher values of B within this range, deep surge cycles occur, indicating more pronounced fluctuations in flow and pressure.

2. **Settling Surge Cycles**: Conversely, when the B parameter values fall between 0.45 and 0.6, the surge cycles are described as settling. In this case, the compressor operates under stable (non-oscillatory) conditions, meaning that any disturbances in flow or pressure will gradually diminish rather than lead to repeated surges. This results in a more stable operation without the oscillatory behavior seen in cyclic surge cycles.

In summary, the key difference lies in the behavior of the compressor during surge: cyclic surge cycles involve oscillations and repeated fluctuations, while settling surge cycles lead to stable conditions without oscillations."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,What are the consequences of compressor surge on the compressor's components?,"Compressor surge can have several destructive consequences on the compressor's components, including:

1. **High Discharge Temperatures**: During surge, the recompression of air that is already at a high temperature can lead to very high compressor discharge temperatures. This can stress materials and components, potentially leading to thermal damage.

2. **Mechanical Stress and Fatigue**: The rapid changes in flow direction and pressure during surge can impose significant mechanical stresses on the compressor components, including blades, casing, and bearings. This can lead to fatigue and eventual failure of these parts.

3. **Vibration and Noise**: Surge can cause increased vibrations and noise levels in the compressor system, which can lead to further mechanical issues and may require additional maintenance or monitoring.

4. **Reduced Efficiency**: The instability caused by surge can lead to a loss of efficiency in the compressor operation, affecting overall system performance and fuel consumption.

5. **Potential for Damage to Downstream Equipment**: The flow reversal and pressure fluctuations associated with surge can also impact downstream components, potentially causing damage or operational issues in associated systems.

6. **Increased Maintenance Requirements**: The effects of surge may necessitate more frequent inspections and maintenance of the compressor and its components to ensure reliability and performance.

Overall, compressor surge can lead to significant operational challenges and increased costs associated with maintenance and repairs."

Specifically, as the efficiency of the compressor decreases (for example, due to stalling), the pressure ratio will fall for a given temperature rise across the compressor. This means that at lower efficiency levels, the compressor is less capable of maintaining the required discharge pressure, leading to a potential flow reversal if the efficiency loss is significant. Conversely, when the compressor operates at higher efficiency, the pressure ratio is higher, allowing for effective compression and stable operation."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,What is the relationship between compressor efficiency and the likelihood of stalling?,"The relationship between compressor efficiency and the likelihood of stalling is inversely proportional. As the efficiency of the compressor decreases, the likelihood of stalling increases. When a compressor operates at lower efficiency, particularly during conditions that lead to flow reversal, the pressure ratio falls. This can result in the compressor being unable to deliver the required discharge pressure, leading to stalling. Thus, a decrease in efficiency due to factors like stalling can create a cycle of instability, where the compressor may experience flow reversal and surge, further exacerbating the efficiency loss."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,How does the compressor's blade velocity affect the Greitzer B parameter?,"The compressor's blade velocity (U) is a key component in the calculation of the Greitzer B parameter, which is defined by the formula:

\[ B = \frac{U \cdot v_p}{2c \cdot A_c \cdot L_c} \]

In this formula:

- \( U \) represents the blade velocity,
- \( v_p \) is the downstream volume,
- \( c \) is the velocity of sound,
- \( A_c \) is the compressor mean flow area,
- \( L_c \) is the compressor length.

As the blade velocity (U) increases, the value of the Greitzer B parameter (B) also increases, assuming all other factors remain constant. This increase in B can influence the nature of surge cycles within the compressor. Specifically, higher values of B (in the range of 0.8 to 5) are associated with cyclic surge cycles, while lower values (in the range of 0.45 to 0.6) can lead to settling surge cycles, resulting in stable (non-oscillatory) conditions. Thus, the blade velocity directly affects the stability and behavior of the compressor during operation."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,What is the impact of irreversible compression on the efficiency of a compressor?,"Irreversible compression negatively impacts the efficiency of a compressor. During the compression process, if the efficiency decreases due to stalling, the pressure ratio falls, leading to reduced discharge pressure. This inefficiency is illustrated in the temperature–entropy diagram, where irreversible compression occurs at different efficiency levels. Specifically, the transition from high efficiency (1-2) to low efficiency (2-3) results in greater energy losses and a decrease in the compressor's ability to maintain the required discharge pressure. Consequently, the compressor may experience flow reversal and surge, further exacerbating efficiency losses and potentially causing damage."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,69,47c79dc634cbe4944c7854563d74f81ae0375523efcfd5b01e6229a53246ac9a,Describe how the downstream volume influences the behavior of a compressor during surge.,"The downstream volume plays a significant role in influencing the behavior of a compressor during surge. When a compressor experiences surge, there is a flow reversal that occurs due to a loss of efficiency, often caused by stalling. This flow reversal leads to a reduction in pressure within the discharge volume downstream of the compressor.

As the pressure in the discharge volume decays, the flow can eventually return to normal, allowing the discharge pressure to build up again. However, if the conditions that initially caused the flow reversal remain unchanged, the flow can again break down and reverse, leading to a cyclic behavior known as surge.

The characteristics of the downstream volume, particularly its size and the associated ducting, affect how quickly pressure changes can occur and how the flow dynamics respond during surge events. The Greitzer B parameter, which incorporates the downstream volume, helps to determine the nature of the surge cycles. For instance, a larger downstream volume can lead to more pronounced surge cycles, while a smaller volume may result in more stable conditions.

In summary, the downstream volume influences the compressor's ability to recover from surge and the stability of its operation by affecting the dynamics of pressure changes and flow behavior during these transient events."

1. **Stable Region**: 
   - In the stable region, when the compressor operates at a point where the gradient of the pressure ratio-flow curve is negative (e.g., point A to point B in Fig. 4.18), a small reduction in compressor inlet flow leads to an increase in the compressor pressure ratio and thus an increase in discharge pressure. This increase in discharge pressure results in an increase in flow through the throttle valve, which works its way upstream to increase the compressor inlet flow, returning the operating point back to stability (point A).

2. **Unstable Region**: 
   - In the unstable region, when operating at a point where the gradient of the pressure ratio-flow curve is positive (e.g., point C to point D in Fig. 4.18), a small reduction in flow decreases the compressor pressure ratio and discharge pressure. This decrease in discharge pressure leads to a reduction in flow through the throttle valve, which further decreases the compressor inlet flow, pushing the operating point further left on the characteristic curve, leading to compressor surge. 

Overall, the stability of the compressor operation is influenced by the efficiency of the compressor and the nature of the flow response to changes in inlet flow conditions."

When the B parameter is in the range of 0.8 to 5, the surge cycles are cyclic, and a deep surge cycle occurs at the higher values of B. Conversely, when the B parameter is in the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the surge cycles are settling and lead to stable (non-oscillatory) conditions at the lower value.

The design of the annulus affects various factors such as blade velocity, stage loading coefficient, and boundary layer growth, which are critical for achieving efficient compressor operation.

1. **Aerodynamic Performance**: The annulus geometry determines the flow area and affects the velocity triangles, which in turn influence the stage loading coefficient. A well-designed annulus can enhance the efficiency of the compressor by optimizing the blade velocity and minimizing losses due to boundary layer effects.

2. **Stage Loading Coefficient**: The design affects the stage loading coefficient, which should ideally be around 0.5 or less for good stage efficiency. A rising line annulus design can lead to a decrease in stage loading as the blade velocity increases, thus improving efficiency.

3. **Pressure Ratio**: The annulus geometry also influences the pressure ratio that can be achieved with fewer stages. A rising line design allows for a higher stage pressure ratio as the compressor progresses, reducing the number of stages needed for a desired overall pressure ratio.

4. **Boundary Layer Management**: The hub-to-tip ratio, which should not exceed 0.9, is crucial in ensuring that the boundary layer does not adversely affect performance. The annulus design must be such that it minimizes the impact of the boundary layer, particularly in high-pressure stages where the blade height reduces and the boundary layer grows.

5. **Blade Height and Work Done Factor**: The annulus geometry affects the blade height, which is critical for maintaining performance. A falling blade mid-height design can lead to a larger blade height and a higher work done factor, as less of the blade height is covered by the boundary layer.

In summary, the annulus geometry is vital for optimizing compressor efficiency, managing aerodynamic performance, and ensuring effective operation under varying conditions."

1. **Increase in Blade Velocity**: As the design progresses along the compressor annulus, the blade velocity at the blade mid-height increases. This is due to the geometry of the rising line design, which allows for a continuous rise in blade height.

2. **Decrease in Stage Loading Coefficient**: The increase in blade velocity results in a decrease in the stage loading coefficient. A lower stage loading coefficient is beneficial as it is associated with improved stage efficiency.

3. **Improved Stage Efficiency**: With the decrease in stage loading, the efficiency of the compressor stage improves. This is because a lower stage loading coefficient typically leads to better aerodynamic performance and reduced losses.

4. **Higher Stage Pressure Ratio**: For a given stage loading coefficient, the rising line design allows for achieving a higher stage pressure ratio as the flow progresses along the annulus. This means that fewer stages may be required to achieve a desired overall pressure ratio, further enhancing efficiency.

Overall, the rising line design is advantageous for improving blade velocity and stage efficiency in compressor annulus geometry."

In high-pressure stages, the blade height tends to reduce, and the boundary layer can grow significantly, potentially covering a large portion of the blade height. By utilizing a falling blade mid-height design, the hub radius is fixed, and a reduction in the tip radius leads to a larger blade height compared to a rising line design. This results in less of the blade height being affected by the boundary layer, which in turn helps to achieve a higher work done factor and improves the overall efficiency of the compressor stage."

Specifically, for a given overall pressure ratio, the hub-to-tip ratio of the last stage cannot exceed 0.9, while the first stage's hub-to-tip ratio is constrained by mechanical stress considerations and is not allowed to fall below 0.5. This means that the design and performance characteristics of the first stage directly impact the allowable hub-to-tip ratio for the last stage in the compressor."

A higher work done factor indicates that less of the blade height is affected by the boundary layer, which can lead to improved aerodynamic performance and efficiency of the compressor stage. 

In designs where the blade mid-height is rising, the work done factor tends to decrease due to increased boundary layer coverage, which can negatively impact stage efficiency. Conversely, in designs with a falling blade mid-height, the work done factor can be higher, resulting in better performance as more of the blade height remains effective in contributing to the compressor's work output. 

Overall, maintaining an optimal work done factor is essential for achieving good stage efficiency, particularly in high-pressure ratio compressors where boundary layer effects can be more pronounced."

Specifically, a rising line annulus design increases the blade velocity at the blade mid-height as one progresses along the compressor annulus. This increase in blade velocity leads to a decrease in the stage loading coefficient, which in turn improves stage efficiency.

As the stage loading coefficient decreases, a higher stage pressure ratio can be achieved for each stage. Consequently, this allows for fewer stages to be required to reach the desired overall pressure ratio. Conversely, if the annulus design does not facilitate this increase in efficiency and pressure ratio, more stages would be necessary to achieve the same overall pressure ratio. Therefore, an effective annulus design, such as a rising line design, can significantly reduce the number of stages needed in a compressor system."

The relationship can be described using the ideal gas law, which states that the density of a gas is directly proportional to its pressure and inversely proportional to its temperature. Specifically, as the discharge pressure increases, the discharge density also increases, assuming the temperature remains constant. Conversely, if the discharge temperature increases while the pressure remains constant, the discharge density will decrease.

In the context of the text, the discharge density is determined by the discharge pressure and temperature, which are largely fixed by the compressor blading (velocity triangles). This means that for a given mass flow rate (m), the continuity equation \( m = ρ × V_a × A \) indicates that the flow area (A) must be adjusted based on the discharge density and axial velocity (Va) to maintain the desired mass flow rate through the compressor."

1. **Starting Difficulties**: Stall and surge can make it impossible to start the engine, as the compressor may not be able to maintain the necessary airflow.

2. **Low Power Operation Issues**: During low power operation, the compressor may experience instability, leading to a failure to operate efficiently or effectively.

3. **Choking of Stages**: As the compressor speed decreases, airflow rates drop more rapidly than speed, which can choke the high-pressure (HP) or back stages of the compressor. This choking can force the low-pressure (LP) or front stages to stall.

4. **Surge Events**: At high operating speeds, the LP stages may choke, causing the HP stages to stall. This can lead to surge events, which are characterized by rapid fluctuations in airflow and pressure.

5. **Need for Remedial Actions**: To mitigate these issues, remedial actions such as incorporating blow-off valves, multi-spooled compressors, and variable geometry stators may be necessary, which can complicate the design and operation of the compressor.

As the compressor speed decreases, the airflow rate falls off more rapidly than the speed, which can lead to choking of the high-pressure (HP) or back stages of the compressor. This choking can force the low-pressure (LP) or front stages to stall, potentially leading to surge conditions.

To mitigate these issues, various strategies can be employed, such as incorporating blow-off valves, using multi-spooled compressors, and implementing variable geometry stators.

They are positioned at some intermediate stages of the compressor and can be opened to reduce the flow to the high-pressure (HP) or back stages. This reduction in flow decreases the velocity in these stages, preventing them from choking. By doing so, blow-off valves help to prevent the front stages from stalling and mitigate the risk of compressor surge during low-speed operation.

Additionally, blow-off valves help to move the running line away from the surge line, thereby improving the surge margin. However, it is important to note that using blow-off valves results in energy waste, so they should be utilized as sparingly as possible."

While blow-off valves help prevent compressor surge and stall during start-up or low power operation by reducing the flow to the high-pressure (HP) stages and thereby lowering the velocity, this process results in a waste of energy. Blow-off should be used sparingly to minimize this energy loss, as it moves the running line away from the surge line and improves the surge margin, but the trade-off is a decrease in overall energy efficiency."

As the design pressure ratios increase, this difference in density becomes more pronounced. Consequently, during start-up and low-speed operation, the increased density difference raises the probability of the LP stages stalling and surging. This is because the LP stages may struggle to maintain adequate airflow as the operating conditions change, leading to potential stall conditions. To mitigate these issues, strategies such as the use of blow-off valves and multi-spool compressors can be implemented to enhance performance and prevent stalling."

As a result, multi-spool compressors can better handle the differences in density at the HP stages during both design and off-design conditions, thereby reducing the likelihood of stall and surge in the LP stages during start-up and low-speed operation. This configuration enhances the overall stability and efficiency of the compressor under varying operating conditions."

1. **Incorporating Blow-off Valves**: Positioning blow-off valves at intermediate stages allows for the reduction of flow to the high-pressure (HP) or back stages during starting. This helps prevent choking in these stages, thereby reducing the risk of stall and surge in the front stages during low power operation.

2. **Utilizing Multi-spool Compressors**: Dividing the compressor into two or more spools, which operate independently without mechanical linkage, allows the HP spool to run at a higher speed than the low-pressure (LP) spool. This design enables better flow management and helps mitigate stall and surge during low-speed operation.

3. **Designing Variable Geometry Stators**: Implementing variable geometry in the stators can help optimize airflow and maintain stability across different operating conditions, thus improving surge margins.

4. **Optimizing Blade Design**: Adjusting the blade height and hub-to-tip ratio can enhance performance. For instance, using a falling blade mid-height design for HP stages can reduce the amount of blade height covered by the boundary layer, leading to a higher work done factor.

5. **Careful Stage Design**: A strategic approach to designing different stages of the compressor (e.g., using rising blade mid-height designs for LP stages and falling designs for HP stages) can help manage airflow and pressure ratios effectively, reducing the likelihood of stall and surge.

6. **Monitoring and Control Systems**: Implementing advanced monitoring and control systems can help detect and respond to off-design conditions promptly, thereby maintaining stable operation and improving surge margins.

1. **Low Pressure (LP) Stages**: For LP stages, a rising blade mid-height design is typically used. This design allows for a larger hub-to-tip ratio, which can enhance the airflow and efficiency at lower pressure ratios.

2. **Intermediate Pressure (IP) Stages**: The IP stages often utilize a constant blade mid-height design. This design provides a balance between performance and stability, accommodating the varying conditions encountered during operation.

3. **High Pressure (HP) Stages**: In HP stages, a falling blade mid-height design is employed. This design results in a larger blade height (h) due to a reduction in the tip radius (Rₜ), which helps minimize the impact of the boundary layer on the blade height, thus achieving a higher work done factor. However, this design also leads to a decrease in velocity at the blade mid-height, necessitating a trade-off between lower blade velocity and hub-to-tip ratio for optimal compressor design.

Overall, the strategy is to transition from a rising blade mid-height design in LP stages to a constant design in IP stages, and finally to a falling design in HP stages, particularly for very high pressure ratio compressors.
