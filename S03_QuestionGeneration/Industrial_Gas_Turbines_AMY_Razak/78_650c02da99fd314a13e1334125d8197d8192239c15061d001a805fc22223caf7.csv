Unlike a compressor stage the favourable pressure gradient present in a turbine stage means that the gas outlet angle β₂ does not change very much with incidence and closely follows the blade outlet angle. This is primarily due to the small boundary layer growth, as stated earlier, enabling a work done factor of unity to be assumed. The profile loss will increase with incidence and this is due to the high stage velocities (particularly at positive incidence) caused by increasing friction loss. See Saravanamuttoo1 et al.
