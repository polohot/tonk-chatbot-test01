In the context of the velocity triangles, rotor deflection and stator deflection can influence the gas outlet angle (β₂) and the blade outlet angle. In turbine stages, the favorable pressure gradient allows the gas outlet angle to closely follow the blade outlet angle, resulting in minimal change with incidence. However, as incidence increases, particularly at positive incidence, the profile loss also increases due to higher stage velocities and increased friction losses.

This means that while rotor and stator deflections can lead to variations in the angles (α1, α2, β1, β2) and velocities (V1, V2, C1, C2) represented in the velocity triangles, the overall impact is characterized by a balance between maintaining efficient flow and managing losses due to deflections and increased incidence. The design must account for these deflections to optimize performance and efficiency in gas turbines."

As the incidence increases, particularly in a turbine stage, the high stage velocities lead to an increase in friction loss. This is due to the unfavorable interaction between the flow and the turbine blades, which results in a thicker boundary layer and higher energy dissipation. Consequently, the profile loss increases with incidence, negatively impacting the overall efficiency of the turbine.

1. **Increased Stage Efficiency**: A low flow coefficient typically results in higher stage efficiency. This is desirable as it means that the turbine can extract more energy from the gas flow for the same amount of work done.

2. **High Blade Velocity**: Maintaining a low flow coefficient allows for high blade velocity, which contributes to improved efficiency. High blade velocity can enhance the turbine's ability to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy.

3. **Reduced Incidence Effects**: With a low flow coefficient, the gas outlet angle (β₂) remains relatively stable and closely follows the blade outlet angle. This stability minimizes deviations and helps maintain optimal performance.

4. **Profile Loss Considerations**: While a low flow coefficient can improve efficiency, it is important to note that profile losses may still increase with incidence due to higher stage velocities. This means that while efficiency may improve, care must be taken to manage friction losses that can arise at higher incidences.

Overall, a low flow coefficient is beneficial for the performance of a gas turbine, leading to increased efficiency and better energy extraction, but it must be balanced with considerations of profile losses and operational conditions."

These angles are significant because they influence the aerodynamic performance and efficiency of the turbine.

1. **α1 (Inlet Angle)**: This angle affects how the incoming gas interacts with the blades. A well-designed inlet angle can optimize the flow entering the turbine, minimizing losses due to flow separation and maximizing the energy transfer from the gas to the blades. An optimal α1 can lead to higher stage efficiency by ensuring that the flow is directed appropriately to harness the maximum work output.

2. **α2 (Outlet Angle)**: This angle is critical for determining the exit flow characteristics of the gas after it has passed through the turbine blades. A favorable outlet angle can help maintain high blade velocity and reduce losses associated with flow misalignment. It also plays a role in ensuring that the gas exits the turbine in a manner that supports downstream components, such as the next stage of the turbine or exhaust systems.

Overall, maintaining optimal values for α1 and α2 is essential for achieving high turbine efficiency, as they directly impact the velocity triangles and the effective energy conversion process within the turbine stage."

As indicated in the provided context, maintaining a high blade velocity leads to a reduction in stage loading (ΔVw/U) and a low flow coefficient (Ca/U). This combination results in improved stage efficiency, which is desirable for optimal turbine operation.

Additionally, the context highlights that the increase in blade velocity contributes to a favorable pressure gradient within the turbine stage, allowing the gas outlet angle (β₂) to remain relatively stable and closely aligned with the blade outlet angle. This stability minimizes boundary layer growth and helps maintain a work done factor of unity, further supporting efficient performance.

However, it is also noted that while increased incidence can lead to higher profile losses due to friction, the overall benefits of increased blade velocity generally outweigh these losses, resulting in enhanced turbine performance."

1. **Boundary Layer Growth**: In turbine stages, the favorable pressure gradient helps maintain a relatively stable gas outlet angle (β₂) that closely follows the blade outlet angle. However, as incidence angles deviate from optimal values, the boundary layer growth can increase, leading to changes in flow characteristics and potentially affecting performance.

2. **Profile Loss**: At higher incidence angles, particularly positive incidence, there is an increase in profile loss due to higher stage velocities and increased friction losses. This can lead to reduced efficiency and performance of the turbine.

3. **Friction Losses**: As the incidence angle increases, the friction losses also increase, which can further exacerbate the challenges in maintaining optimal performance. This is particularly critical at high stage velocities, where the impact of friction is more pronounced.

4. **Operational Stability**: Maintaining optimal incidence angles is crucial for operational stability. Deviations can lead to flow separation and unsteady aerodynamic conditions, which can cause vibrations and potential damage to the turbine components.
