16.2 Changes in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Maintained to allow for transient conditions. This is achieved by limiting the maximum power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures to 45 MW. Limiting the power output at low ambient temperatures will decrease the turbine entry temperature, T₃. This is necessary to reduce the specific work in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at the maximum power limit of 45 MW. As a result, the rate of increase in the compressor pressure ratio decreases as can be seen in Figs 16.1 and 16.3. The reduction in T₃ will reduce the turbine creep life usage at these ambient temperatures. Thus manufacturers may impose the maximum power limit to ensure satisfactory turbine creep life at low ambient temperatures in a manner similar to that discussed in Section 11.3.8 (rating curves).

The rate of increase in thermal efficiency also decreases when operating at constant power output (Fig. 16.2), as the ambient temperature lowers. This is primarily due to the effect on compressor pressure ratio and the (slight) decrease in T₃/T₁ (Fig. 16.3). There is also a reduction in compressor efficiency under these conditions as the compressor operates in a region on the compressor characteristic where the compressor efficiency is lower.

The trends in compressor and turbine powers are shown in Fig. 16.4. The increase in the turbine power output is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature, pressure ratio and mass flow rate through the turbine. The increase in compressor power absorbed is due primarily to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor and pressure ratio. The figure also shows the trends in the isentropic efficiencies of the compressor and turbine.

16.3 Trends in pressure and temperature ratios during temperature transient.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The compressor efficiency initially increases slightly before decreasing as the compressor operates in a lower efficiency part of its characteristic at low ambient temperatures. The turbine efficiency decreases slightly before increasing slightly, due to the change in the turbine non-dimensional speed. During constant EGT operation the turbine entry temperature increases (Fig. 16.8), resulting in a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, thus giving a slight reduction in turbine efficiency. During constant power operation, the turbine entry temperature decreases, hence increasing the turbine non-dimensional speed resulting in a slight gain in the turbine efficiency.

The changes in power and thermal efficiency trends can be displayed on an ambient temperature basis and these are shown in Figs 16.5 and 16.6, respectively. Figure 16.6 also shows the change in specific work where the increase in specific work is noted during constant EGT operation and a decrease in specific work during constant power operation.

# 16.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperatures

During constant EGT operation it has been shown that the compressor pressure ratio and thus the turbine pressure ratio increase. This results in an increased compressor discharge pressure, P2, and turbine entry pressure, P3, during the transient as shown in Fig. 16.7. However, when operating at constant power output a decrease in rate of pressure rise is observed, which is due to a decrease in the rate of compressor pressure ratio increase (Fig. 16.3).

During constant power operation, the turbine entry temperature decreases, hence increasing the turbine non-dimensional speed resulting in a slight gain in the turbine efficiency.

The changes in power and thermal efficiency trends can be displayed on an ambient temperature basis and these are shown in Figs 16.5 and 16.6, respectively. Figure 16.6 also shows the change in specific work where the increase in specific work is noted during constant EGT operation and a decrease in specific work during constant power operation.

# 16.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperatures

During constant EGT operation it has been shown that the compressor pressure ratio and thus the turbine pressure ratio increase. This results in an increased compressor discharge pressure, P2, and turbine entry pressure, P3, during the transient as shown in Fig. 16.7. However, when operating at constant power output a decrease in rate of pressure rise is observed, which is due to a decrease in the rate of compressor pressure ratio increase (Fig. 16.3).

16.2 Changes in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Maintained to allow for transient conditions. This is achieved by limiting the maximum power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures to 45 MW. Limiting the power output at low ambient temperatures will decrease the turbine entry temperature, T₃. This is necessary to reduce the specific work in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at the maximum power limit of 45 MW. As a result, the rate of increase in the compressor pressure ratio decreases as can be seen in Figs 16.1 and 16.3. The reduction in T₃ will reduce the turbine creep life usage at these ambient temperatures. Thus manufacturers may impose the maximum power limit to ensure satisfactory turbine creep life at low ambient temperatures in a manner similar to that discussed in Section 11.3.8 (rating curves).

The rate of increase in thermal efficiency also decreases when operating at constant power output (Fig. 16.2), as the ambient temperature lowers. This is primarily due to the effect on compressor pressure ratio and the (slight) decrease in T₃/T₁ (Fig. 16.3). There is also a reduction in compressor efficiency under these conditions as the compressor operates in a region on the compressor characteristic where the compressor efficiency is lower.

The trends in compressor and turbine powers are shown in Fig. 16.4. The increase in the turbine power output is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature, pressure ratio and mass flow rate through the turbine. The increase in compressor power absorbed is due primarily to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor and pressure ratio. The figure also shows the trends in the isentropic efficiencies of the compressor and turbine.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The compressor efficiency initially increases slightly before decreasing as the compressor operates in a lower efficiency part of its characteristic at low ambient temperatures. The turbine efficiency decreases slightly before increasing slightly, due to the change in the turbine non-dimensional speed. During constant EGT operation the turbine entry temperature increases (Fig. 16.8), resulting in a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, thus giving a slight reduction in turbine efficiency. During constant power operation, the turbine entry temperature decreases, hence increasing the turbine non-dimensional speed resulting in a slight gain in the turbine efficiency.

The changes in power and thermal efficiency trends can be displayed on an ambient temperature basis and these are shown in Figs 16.5 and 16.6, respectively. Figure 16.6 also shows the change in specific work where the increase in specific work is noted during constant EGT operation and a decrease in specific work during constant power operation.

16.2 Changes in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Maintained to allow for transient conditions. This is achieved by limiting the maximum power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures to 45 MW. Limiting the power output at low ambient temperatures will decrease the turbine entry temperature, T₃. This is necessary to reduce the specific work in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at the maximum power limit of 45 MW. As a result, the rate of increase in the compressor pressure ratio decreases as can be seen in Figs 16.1 and 16.3. The reduction in T₃ will reduce the turbine creep life usage at these ambient temperatures. Thus manufacturers may impose the maximum power limit to ensure satisfactory turbine creep life at low ambient temperatures in a manner similar to that discussed in Section 11.3.8 (rating curves).

The rate of increase in thermal efficiency also decreases when operating at constant power output (Fig. 16.2), as the ambient temperature lowers. This is primarily due to the effect on compressor pressure ratio and the (slight) decrease in T₃/T₁ (Fig. 16.3). There is also a reduction in compressor efficiency under these conditions as the compressor operates in a region on the compressor characteristic where the compressor efficiency is lower.

The trends in compressor and turbine powers are shown in Fig. 16.4. The increase in the turbine power output is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature, pressure ratio and mass flow rate through the turbine. The increase in compressor power absorbed is due primarily to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor and pressure ratio. The figure also shows the trends in the isentropic efficiencies of the compressor and turbine.

16.3 Trends in pressure and temperature ratios during temperature transient.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The compressor efficiency initially increases slightly before decreasing as the compressor operates in a lower efficiency part of its characteristic at low ambient temperatures. The turbine efficiency decreases slightly before increasing slightly, due to the change in the turbine non-dimensional speed. During constant EGT operation the turbine entry temperature increases (Fig. 16.8), resulting in a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, thus giving a slight reduction in turbine efficiency. During constant power operation, the turbine entry temperature decreases, hence increasing the turbine non-dimensional speed resulting in a slight gain in the turbine efficiency.

The changes in power and thermal efficiency trends can be displayed on an ambient temperature basis and these are shown in Figs 16.5 and 16.6, respectively. Figure 16.6 also shows the change in specific work where the increase in specific work is noted during constant EGT operation and a decrease in specific work during constant power operation.

# 16.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperatures

During constant EGT operation it has been shown that the compressor pressure ratio and thus the turbine pressure ratio increase. This results in an increased compressor discharge pressure, P2, and turbine entry pressure, P3, during the transient as shown in Fig. 16.7. However, when operating at constant power output a decrease in rate of pressure rise is observed, which is due to a decrease in the rate of compressor pressure ratio increase (Fig. 16.3).
