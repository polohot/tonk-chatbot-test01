The increase in temperature of a gas stream when it is brought to rest also results in an increase in pressure which is called the stagnation or total pressure. This increase in pressure or stagnation pressure can be calculated if it is assumed that the gas is brought to rest adiabatically and reversibly (i.e. isentropically). The total to static pressure ratio is given by:

Ps = P ⌈ T ⌉γ – 1

Ts ⎝ γ

where P is the total or stagnation pressure, Ps is the static pressure, and γ is the isentropic index, cp/cv.

Unlike the total temperature, which is constant for a stream flowing without heat and work transfer, the total pressure will only remain constant in the absence of friction. Further details on stagnation properties may be found in Rogers et al.1
