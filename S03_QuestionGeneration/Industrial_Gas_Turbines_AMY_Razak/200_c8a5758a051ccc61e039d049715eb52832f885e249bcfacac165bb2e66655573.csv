# 11.4 Effect of reduced power output during a change in ambient temperature

Preceding sections discussed the impact of ambient temperature on engine performance when the engine was operating on limits such as the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed. The case is now considered where the engine is operating at a low enough power output, such that no engine limit is reached during the same ambient temperature transient. To achieve this, the simulator is operated at an electrical power demand of 17.5 MW. As the ambient temperature decreases when operating at a constant power output (17.5 MW), the non-dimensional power (Power/P₁√T₁) will increase. Figure 11.7 shows that the non-dimensional power increases with the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus an increase in non-dimensional power implies an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. This increase in non-dimensional speed will therefore result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, and other non-dimensional parameters, as shown in Figs 11.3 to 11.7.

# 11.4.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic during the ambient temperature transient is shown in Fig. 11.21. Due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio, the operating point moves up the characteristic closely following the engine running line. Note that the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristics is not as great as in the previous case when the engine was forced to operate on control system limits, as shown in Fig. 11.9.

# 11.4.2 Trends in speed

The trends of the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed are shown in Fig. 11.22. Observe that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases, as explained in Section 11.4. The gas generator speed, however, decreases with the decrease in ambient temperature. Note that the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is not as great as was observed when the engine power output was constrained by a control system limit. Thus, the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is smaller for a given fall in ambient temperature. The interaction of the component characteristics (compressor and turbines) and the shape of the compressor characteristic (including VIGV position) result in a continuous fall in the gas generator speed with decreasing ambient temperature.

Requires a drop in N₁/√T₁ increases as T₁ falls, but N₁ to maintain the required N₁/√T₁ as dictated by component matching between the compressor and turbines (speed compatibility). Thus this trend differs from the previous case where the gas generator speed was observed to increase as the ambient temperature decreased during constant EGT operation, as shown in Fig. 11.8.

# 11.4.3 Trends in pressure ratio

Figure 11.23 shows the trends in the pressure ratios of the engine components (compressor and turbines). The compressor pressure ratio is observed to increase due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. The trend in the pressure ratio of the gas generator turbine is essentially constant.

To achieve this, the simulator is operated at an electrical power demand of 17.5 MW. As the ambient temperature decreases when operating at a constant power output (17.5 MW), the non-dimensional power (Power/P₁√T₁) will increase. Figure 11.7 shows that the non-dimensional power increases with the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus an increase in non-dimensional power implies an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. This increase in non-dimensional speed will therefore result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, and other non-dimensional parameters, as shown in Figs 11.3 to 11.7.

# 11.4.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic during the ambient temperature transient is shown in Fig. 11.21. Due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio, the operating point moves up the characteristic closely following the engine running line. Note that the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristics is not as great as in the previous case when the engine was forced to operate on control system limits, as shown in Fig. 11.9.

# 11.4.2 Trends in speed

The trends of the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed are shown in Fig. 11.22. Observe that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases, as explained in Section 11.4. The gas generator speed, however, decreases with the decrease in ambient temperature. Note that the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is not as great as was observed when the engine power output was constrained by a control system limit. Thus, the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is smaller for a given fall in ambient temperature. The interaction of the component characteristics (compressor and turbines) and the shape of the compressor characteristic (including VIGV position) result in a continuous fall in the gas generator speed with decreasing ambient temperature.

Requires a drop in N₁/√T₁ increases as T₁ falls, but N₁ to maintain the required N₁/√T₁ as dictated by component matching between the compressor and turbines (speed compatibility). Thus this trend differs from the previous case where the gas generator speed was observed to increase as the ambient temperature decreased during constant EGT operation, as shown in Fig. 11.8.

Figure 11.23 shows the trends in the pressure ratios of the engine components (compressor and turbines). The compressor pressure ratio is observed to increase due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. The trend in the pressure ratio of the gas generator turbine is essentially constant.

# 11.4.2 Trends in speed

The trends of the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed are shown in Fig. 11.22. Observe that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases, as explained in Section 11.4. The gas generator speed, however, decreases with the decrease in ambient temperature. Note that the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is not as great as was observed when the engine power output was constrained by a control system limit. Thus, the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is smaller for a given fall in ambient temperature. The interaction of the component characteristics (compressor and turbines) and the shape of the compressor characteristic (including VIGV position) result in a continuous fall in the gas generator speed with decreasing ambient temperature.

Requires a drop in N₁/√T₁ increases as T₁ falls, but N₁ to maintain the required N₁/√T₁ as dictated by component matching between the compressor and turbines (speed compatibility). Thus this trend differs from the previous case where the gas generator speed was observed to increase as the ambient temperature decreased during constant EGT operation, as shown in Fig. 11.8.

# 11.4.3 Trends in pressure ratio

Figure 11.23 shows the trends in the pressure ratios of the engine components (compressor and turbines). The compressor pressure ratio is observed to increase due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. The trend in the pressure ratio of the gas generator turbine is essentially constant.

# 11.4.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As no engine limits are exceeded, the engine is capable of delivering the required power demand by the generator (17.5 MW) during the ambient temperature transient. The gas power also remains essentially constant, although a very slight decrease in gas power is observed, as seen in Fig. ",How does the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature change with ambient temperature during low-power operation?,"The ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, increases as the ambient temperature decreases during low-power operation.","During low-power operation, a drop in ambient temperature leads to an increase in the T₃/T₁ ratio.","As ambient temperature falls at low power, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, rises.","The text states that, under low-power conditions, decreasing ambient temperatures result in a higher T₃/T₁ ratio.","In the context of low-power operation, the T₃/T₁ ratio escalates with the reduction in ambient temperature."

Figure 11.19 also represents CO2 emissions on an index basis, which is defined as the mass of CO2 emissions per kW h of power produced. The increase in thermal efficiency at lower ambient temperatures reduces the fuel flow per unit of power generated. Thus, the CO2 emission index decreases with decrease in ambient temperature.

Reduction in emissions of NOₓ, CO and UHCs have been achieved by the development of combustion technologies such as DLE combustors, where the emissions of NOx and CO are below 25 ppm.

# 11.4 Effect of reduced power output during a change in ambient temperature

Preceding sections discussed the impact of ambient temperature on engine performance when the engine was operating on limits such as the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed. The case is now considered where the engine is operating at a low enough power output, such that no engine limit is reached during the same ambient temperature transient. To achieve this, the simulator is operated at an electrical power demand of 17.5 MW. As the ambient temperature decreases when operating at a constant power output (17.5 MW), the non-dimensional power (Power/P₁√T₁) will increase. Figure 11.7 shows that the non-dimensional power increases with the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus an increase in non-dimensional power implies an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. This increase in non-dimensional speed will therefore result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, and other non-dimensional parameters, as shown in Figs 11.3 to 11.7.

# 11.4.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic during the ambient temperature transient is shown in Fig. 11.21. Due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio, the operating point moves up the characteristic closely following the engine running line. Note that the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristics is not as great as in the previous case when the engine was forced to operate on control system limits, as shown in Fig. 11.9.
