In practice, there is always some heat transfer and the temperature achieved during combustion is always less than the true adiabatic flame temperature.

At flame temperatures above 1800 K, products of combustion may dissociate to form radicals and species. These reactions absorb energy (endothermic) and will further suppress the flame temperature. When comparing the flame temperature of different fuels, it is convenient to work with equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratio, φ, is defined as:

φ = ( FAR    =  m                                            [6.7]

For lean mixtures, the equivalence ratio will be less than one and for rich mixtures the equivalence ratio will be greater than one. Fuel–air ratios corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio have an equivalence ratio of one.

Figure 6.2 shows the adiabatic flame temperature for CH₄ varying with equivalence ratio. The figure also shows the deviation of the actual adiabatic flame temperature from the theoretical value due to the effects of dissociation. Note the maximum actual adiabatic flame temperature occurs at slightly rich mixtures (e.g. φ = 1.05). The adiabatic temperature for higher carbon content fuels will be higher and the equivalence ratio where the maximum adiabatic flame temperature occurs also increases.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

At flame temperatures above 1800 K, products of combustion may dissociate to form radicals and species. These reactions absorb energy (endothermic) and will further suppress the flame temperature. When comparing the flame temperature of different fuels, it is convenient to work with equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratio, φ, is defined as:

φ = ( FAR    =  m                                            [6.7]

For lean mixtures, the equivalence ratio will be less than one and for rich mixtures the equivalence ratio will be greater than one. Fuel–air ratios corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio have an equivalence ratio of one.

Figure 6.2 shows the adiabatic flame temperature for CH₄ varying with equivalence ratio. The figure also shows the deviation of the actual adiabatic flame temperature from the theoretical value due to the effects of dissociation. Note the maximum actual adiabatic flame temperature occurs at slightly rich mixtures (e.g. φ = 1.05). The adiabatic temperature for higher carbon content fuels will be higher and the equivalence ratio where the maximum adiabatic flame temperature occurs also increases.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

",What is the function of the diffuser in a gas turbine combustion system?,"The diffuser reduces the compressor exit air velocity to facilitate combustion, lowering it from about 200 m/s to a fifth of its initial value.","Its role is to decrease the high-velocity air from the compressor to a manageable speed for combustion, preventing excessive pressure losses.","By slowing down the compressor discharge air, the diffuser ensures stable combustion and minimizes pressure loss in the combustor.","The diffuser's main function is velocity reduction, enabling efficient combustion by providing air at a lower speed suitable for flame stability.","To support combustion, the diffuser significantly reduces air velocity, addressing both combustion stability and performance issues in the gas turbine."

The velocity of the air leaving the diffuser is about 25 m/s and the flame velocity of hydrocarbon fuels is in the order of a few m/s (5 to 7 m/s). Any attempt to burn fuel in the air stream leaving the diffuser will result in the

flame being extinguished. This is because the time available for combustion (chemical reaction) is less than the time needed to heat the fresh mixture to its ignition temperature (formation of radicals and species in the fuel). ",What challenges arise from attempting combustion in high-velocity air streams?,High-velocity air can extinguish flames by not allowing sufficient time for the mixture to reach ignition temperature before being swept away.,"Combustion in fast-moving air is problematic as the flame may be blown out, lacking the time needed for proper ignition and reaction.","The main issue is the short residence time, preventing the fuel-air mixture from adequately heating to sustain combustion.",Flames struggle to stabilize in high-speed flows because the chemical reaction time exceeds the available mixing and heating time.,"High velocities reduce the time for combustion reactions to complete, leading to potential flame extinction and inefficient burning."
