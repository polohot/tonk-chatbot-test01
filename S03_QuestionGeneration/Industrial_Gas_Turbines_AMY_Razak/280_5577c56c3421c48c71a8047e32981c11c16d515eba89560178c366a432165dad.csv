# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

# 18.4.1 Trends in fault indices

Hot end damage has been implemented by increasing the turbine capacity and decreasing its efficiency via fault indices. This is shown as a trend in Fig. 18.25, where it is observed that the turbine fouling fault index increases from 0% to 3%, while the efficiency fault index decreases from 0% to –2% over a period of 1 hour.

# 18.4.2 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratios

The increase in the turbine fouling fault index results in increased turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. If it is assumed that the maximum to minimum cycle, temperature ratio T₃/T₁, remains constant, then from the flow compatibility equation (Equation 8.1) the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, decreases. This is because the compressor non-dimensional flow remains essentially constant due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed lines.

Since the engine is on an EGT limit, any decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, and therefore in the turbine pressure ratio, causes the turbine entry temperature to decrease, which requires a further reduction in the compressor pressure ratio to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine. This is shown in Fig. ",What are the assumed inlet and exhaust losses in the simulation?,The assumed inlet and exhaust losses are 100 mm water gauge.,"In the simulation, both inlet and exhaust losses are set at 100 mm water gauge.",100 mm water gauge is the value used for both inlet and exhaust losses in the simulation.,The simulation assumes losses of 100 mm water gauge for both the inlet and exhaust.,"For the simulation, the inlet and exhaust losses are each 100 mm water gauge."
