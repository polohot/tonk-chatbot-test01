# 6.5 Fuel injection and atomisation

For satisfactory combustion of liquid fuel, such as kerosene, sufficient quantities of fuel vapour must be produced to sustain the combustion process in gas turbines. The production of fuel vapour in necessary quantities starts with the atomisation of the fuel, where a large number of fine droplets are produced. However, the droplets are still liquid and have to be evaporated and heated to the ignition temperature. The droplet temperature increases until it reaches the fuel boiling point and then remains constant due to the absorption of latent heat required by the evaporation process. Clearly, the rate of evaporation depends on many factors such as the droplet size, combustion air pressure and temperature, and the specific heat of the fuel. Poor atomisation can lead to reduced combustion efficiency and the formation of pollutants such as CO and UHC.

",What is the importance of atomisation in the combustion of liquid fuels like kerosene in gas turbines?,"Atomisation is crucial because it produces fine droplets of fuel, which are necessary for sufficient fuel vapour production to sustain combustion.","Without proper atomisation, the combustion process in gas turbines would be inefficient, as it starts with the creation of fine fuel droplets for evaporation.","Atomisation ensures the production of a large number of fine fuel droplets, essential for generating enough fuel vapour for combustion in gas turbines.","The process of atomisation is vital for converting liquid fuel into fine droplets, which then evaporate and heat to ignition temperature for combustion.","Effective atomisation leads to efficient combustion by producing fine fuel droplets that evaporate quickly, sustaining the combustion process in gas turbines."
