In this reducing reaction, the OH radical is reduced to hydrogen H and the released oxygen combines with the CO to produce CO₂.

Fuels that have a high carbon–hydrogen ratio, such as heavy fuel oils, may thus require a longer burning time to convert the CO into CO₂. The burning time is an important factor in combustor design. It is referred to as the residence time and represents the time the fuel spends in the burning or primary zone. If large residence times are required, as with heavy fuel oils, the volume of the combustion chamber will have to increase.

An example of the chemical equation governing the combustion of methane (CH₄) in O₂ is given by Equation 6.1:

CH₄ + 2O₂ ⍇⍇⍇→ (CO + OH + CH₃) ⍇⍇⍇→ CO₂ + 2H₂O

Thus one molecule of CH₄ will combine with two molecules of O₂ to produce one molecule of CO₂ and two molecules of H₂O.

The carbon and hydrogen content of the fuel determine the amount of fuel needed for complete combustion in air. For hydrocarbon fuels this can be represented by the carbon–hydrogen ratio. Any hydrocarbon may be represented as CₓHᵧ where x and y are the numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the fuel, respectively.

# Gas turbine combustion

The ratio of fuel to air on a mass basis for complete combustion is called the stoichiometric fuel–air ratio. Fuel–air mixtures that have excess air are called lean mixtures and when excess fuel is present are referred to as rich mixtures.

# 6.1.1 Stoichiometric fuel–air ratio

Air contains 1 molecule (mole) of O2 and 3.76 molecules (moles) nitrogen (N2). We have ignored the amount of carbon dioxide and argon as these are very small compared with the amount of oxygen and nitrogen in air. It has been stated that a molecule of a hydrocarbon fuel can be represented by its carbon–hydrogen ratio. The stoichiometric combustion equation can now be represented as:

CxHy + ms(O2 + 3.76N2) = xCO2 + (y/2) H2O + 3.76 ms N2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.2]

CxHy + msO2 = xCO2 + (y/2)H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.2a]

where ms are the moles of air required for complete combustion. For complete combustion, the number of moles of O2 per mole of fuel is ms = x + y/4 (Equation 6.2a).

The stoichiometric fuel–air mass ratio (FAR)s is given by:

(FAR)s = (12.01 + 1.008) / (ms(32 + 3.76 × 28.013)) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.3]

where 12.01 is the atomic weight of carbon, 1.008 is the atomic weight of H2, 32 is the mole weight of O2 and 28.013 is the mole weight of N2.

Therefore, the stoichiometric fuel–air mass ratio is:

(FAR)s = (12.01 + 1.008) / (137.33⌈ x + y ⌉ / 4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.4]

If we burn methane (CH4, x = 1 and y = 4) in air, the stoichiometric fuel–air ratio is 0.0584. So we require, for complete combustion, 17.12 kg of air to burn 1 kg of methane. If we burn kerosene, which can be represented as C12H24, where x = 12 and y = 24, the stoichiometric fuel–air ratio is 0.068 and we require 14.71 kg of air to burn 1 kg of kerosene.

# 6.1.2 Combustion in excess air

Combustion in excess air will result in the presence of oxygen in the products of combustion and is the normal case in gas turbines. Equation 6.5 gives the molar balance for this case:

# 140 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

CₓHy +  m(O₂ + 3.76N₂) = xCO₂ + (y/2)H₂O + (m – x – y/4)O₂ + 3.76N₂                 [6.5]

where ‘m’ is now in excess of ‘ ms’ and results in unreacted oxygen being present in the combustion gas stream. The fuel–air ratio (FAR) is:

12.01  + 1.008

FAR =        x        y                                      [6.6]

Thus one molecule of CH₄ will combine with two molecules of O₂ to produce one molecule of CO₂ and two molecules of H₂O.

The carbon and hydrogen content of the fuel determine the amount of fuel needed for complete combustion in air. For hydrocarbon fuels this can be represented by the carbon–hydrogen ratio. Any hydrocarbon may be represented as CₓHᵧ where x and y are the numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the fuel, respectively.

# Gas turbine combustion

The ratio of fuel to air on a mass basis for complete combustion is called the stoichiometric fuel–air ratio. Fuel–air mixtures that have excess air are called lean mixtures and when excess fuel is present are referred to as rich mixtures.

# 6.1.1 Stoichiometric fuel–air ratio

Air contains 1 molecule (mole) of O2 and 3.76 molecules (moles) nitrogen (N2). We have ignored the amount of carbon dioxide and argon as these are very small compared with the amount of oxygen and nitrogen in air. It has been stated that a molecule of a hydrocarbon fuel can be represented by its carbon–hydrogen ratio. The stoichiometric combustion equation can now be represented as:

CxHy + ms(O2 + 3.76N2) = xCO2 + (y/2) H2O + 3.76 ms N2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.2]

CxHy + msO2 = xCO2 + (y/2)H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.2a]

where ms are the moles of air required for complete combustion. For complete combustion, the number of moles of O2 per mole of fuel is ms = x + y/4 (Equation 6.2a).

The stoichiometric fuel–air mass ratio (FAR)s is given by:

(FAR)s = (12.01 + 1.008) / (ms(32 + 3.76 × 28.013)) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.3]

where 12.01 is the atomic weight of carbon, 1.008 is the atomic weight of H2, 32 is the mole weight of O2 and 28.013 is the mole weight of N2.

Therefore, the stoichiometric fuel–air mass ratio is:

(FAR)s = (12.01 + 1.008) / (137.33⌈ x + y ⌉ / 4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.4]

If we burn methane (CH4, x = 1 and y = 4) in air, the stoichiometric fuel–air ratio is 0.0584. So we require, for complete combustion, 17.12 kg of air to burn 1 kg of methane. If we burn kerosene, which can be represented as C12H24, where x = 12 and y = 24, the stoichiometric fuel–air ratio is 0.068 and we require 14.71 kg of air to burn 1 kg of kerosene.

# 6.1.2 Combustion in excess air

Combustion in excess air will result in the presence of oxygen in the products of combustion and is the normal case in gas turbines. Equation 6.5 gives the molar balance for this case:

# 140 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

CₓHy +  m(O₂ + 3.76N₂) = xCO₂ + (y/2)H₂O + (m – x – y/4)O₂ + 3.76N₂                 [6.5]

where ‘m’ is now in excess of ‘ ms’ and results in unreacted oxygen being present in the combustion gas stream. The fuel–air ratio (FAR) is:

12.01  + 1.008

FAR =        x        y                                      [6.6]
