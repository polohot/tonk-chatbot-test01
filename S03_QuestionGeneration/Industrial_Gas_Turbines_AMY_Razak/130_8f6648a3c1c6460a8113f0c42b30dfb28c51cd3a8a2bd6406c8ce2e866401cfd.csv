This means that as the compressor speed changes, the ratio of the temperatures at the exit (T₃) and the inlet (T₁) of the compressor will also change in a specific manner. The relationship is such that for constant specific heats, each compressor speed corresponds to a distinct operating point on the compressor characteristic, which is reflected in the value of T₃/T₁. Thus, the equation establishes a direct link between the compressor speed and the temperature ratio, allowing for the determination of unique operating points for the compressor at different speeds."

This relationship indicates that for a given compressor speed, there is a specific combination of these parameters that ensures flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. 

In essence, the equation establishes a fixed relationship that must be maintained to ensure that the flow through the compressor matches the requirements of the gas generator turbine. If the flow compatibility is not achieved, it could lead to performance issues such as surge or stall, particularly at low power and idle operating conditions where the running line may intersect with the surge line. Thus, the equation highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate operating conditions to ensure efficient and stable operation of the gas turbine system."

This means that under choking conditions, the relationship between the mass flow rate (W₃), temperature (T₃), and pressure (P₃) becomes constrained, leading to a specific, constant value for this ratio. As a result, the choking condition ensures that the flow through the turbine reaches a maximum limit, which directly influences the operational characteristics of the gas turbine system."

At these high speeds, W₁√T₁/P₁ remains approximately constant, which limits the variability in the relationship between P₂/P₁ and W₁√T₁/P₁. As a result, despite the potential for multiple solutions from Equation 8.5, the operational characteristics of the compressor lead to a unique solution under the given conditions."

This, in turn, affects the unique values for T₃/T₁, leading to distinct operating points on each compressor speed line. Each of these points contributes to the formation of the running line on the compressor characteristic for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine."

As the compressor operates at different speeds, each speed corresponds to a unique operating point that reflects the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. 

This running line is created by joining the unique operating points for each compressor speed, resulting in a distinct trajectory on the compressor characteristic curve. Unlike a single-shaft gas turbine, which may exhibit multiple running lines at constant power outputs, the two-shaft configuration typically shows a single running line that reflects the operational characteristics of the gas turbine under varying conditions. 

Furthermore, while ambient conditions and gas property changes can slightly alter this running line, particularly at low ambient temperatures, the overall shape remains relatively stable, allowing for predictable performance of the two-shaft gas turbine across its operating range. This unique running line is essential for understanding the compressor's behavior and ensuring efficient operation of the gas turbine system."

Although the impact of these changes is usually small, particularly at low ambient temperatures, they can lead to variations in the values of T₃/T₁ and subsequently alter the shape and position of the running line on the compressor characteristic. This means that as ambient conditions change, the running line may adjust accordingly, reflecting the new operating conditions of the gas turbine. For a rigorous analysis, it is important to account for these gas property changes, as they can influence the performance and efficiency of the turbine system."

In contrast, a single-shaft gas turbine has a series of running lines, each corresponding to a constant power output. This distinction is illustrated in the figures referenced in the text, where the two-shaft gas turbine's running line is more stable and does not show significant changes with varying conditions, while the single-shaft gas turbine exhibits multiple running lines based on different power outputs."

When the running line, which represents the operational performance of the gas turbine, intersects with the surge line, it suggests that the compressor may operate in a region where flow instability can occur. This instability can lead to a sudden loss of airflow through the compressor, resulting in a surge condition that can cause damage to the turbine and affect overall performance. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and manage operating conditions to avoid this intersection, ensuring stable and efficient operation of the gas turbine, particularly at low power and idle states."

However, this change is usually small, particularly at low ambient temperatures. In a rigorous analysis, these gas property changes need to be accounted for, as they can affect the relationship between the compressor's performance and the operating conditions. This results in a modified running line compared to the case where gas properties are assumed constant, which is particularly relevant for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine."

Specifically, the flow parameter \( W_1\sqrt{T_1}/P_1 \) remains approximately constant at high speeds. This means that for a given compressor speed, the relationship between flow and pressure ratio becomes more stable, leading to a unique solution for the operating points on the compressor characteristic. As a result, the running line on the compressor characteristic for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is defined more distinctly, as opposed to the case of a single-shaft gas turbine, which may exhibit multiple running lines at different power outputs."

For a given compressor speed, the equation \( T_3/T_1 \) is uniquely defined by Equation 8.4, assuming constant specific heats and that the effects of compressor bleeds and fuel flow on \( W_3 \) are ignored. 

As different compressor non-dimensional speeds are considered, they yield different values for \( \Delta T_{21}/T_1 \), which in turn results in unique values for \( T_3/T_1 \). By plotting these unique operating points for each compressor speed, a running line can be established on the compressor characteristic curve. This running line represents the operational behavior of a two-shaft gas turbine with a free power turbine. 

Additionally, while gas property changes can affect the running line with varying ambient conditions, these changes are typically minor, especially at low ambient temperatures. Thus, the running line can be effectively determined by the aforementioned relationships under the specified conditions."

Each point on the running line corresponds to a specific operational state of the gas turbine, reflecting the relationship between the flow rate and pressure ratio under varying conditions. 

As the running line is derived from the compressor's performance characteristics, it shows how the gas turbine operates across different non-dimensional speeds and ambient conditions. The running line indicates the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine, highlighting the unique values of temperature ratios (T₃/T₁) and power output at each operating point. 

In contrast to a single-shaft gas turbine, where multiple running lines may exist for different power outputs, the two-shaft configuration with a free power turbine results in a unique running line for each speed line. This allows for a clearer understanding of how the gas turbine performs under various conditions, particularly at high speeds where the compressor characteristic remains relatively stable. 

Overall, the running line provides insight into the efficiency and operational limits of the gas turbine, helping engineers and operators optimize performance while avoiding conditions such as surge, especially at low power and idle operating states."
