",Why does the engine trip during the acceptance test when loaded to generate a power output of 20 MW after a hot-end change with a 7.5% smaller capacity gas generator turbine?,"The engine trips because the reduced capacity of the replacement gas generator turbine cannot sustain the 20 MW load, exceeding its maximum operational limit.","Due to the 7.5% reduction in turbine capacity, the engine's maximum power output is lowered, causing it to trip when attempting to meet the 20 MW demand.","The trip occurs as the new turbine's smaller capacity is insufficient to handle the 20 MW load, surpassing its designed operational threshold.","With a 7.5% smaller capacity, the turbine's ability to generate power is compromised, leading to a trip at the 20 MW load during testing.","The engine trips because the replacement turbine's reduced capacity fails to support the 20 MW power output, triggering protective shutdown mechanisms."

","How are NOx, CO, and CO₂ emissions affected when operating two gas turbines at equal load versus running one engine to meet a total power requirement of 20 MW?","Operating two turbines at equal load distributes the emissions, potentially reducing per-unit output emissions compared to running one engine at full capacity.","Running one engine may concentrate emissions, possibly increasing per-MW emissions, whereas two engines at equal load could offer more efficient emission distribution.","Emissions are more evenly distributed with two engines at equal load, possibly leading to lower per-MW emissions than a single engine at higher load.","Using two engines splits the power demand, potentially optimizing combustion and reducing specific emissions compared to a single, heavily loaded engine.","Two engines operating at equal load may achieve better emission performance by optimizing load distribution, unlike a single engine bearing the full load."
