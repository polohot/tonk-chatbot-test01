# 11.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

It was stated in Chapter 2 that it is the specific humidity which affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly NOₓ. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. Also observe that the variation in γ is small compared with cₚ and R.

For a given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity will increase the specific humidity, as can be seen from Fig. 2.16 in Chapter 2. During maximum power demand and operating at high ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). For a given ambient temperature, the ratio of exhaust gas temperature to compressor inlet temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, is fixed (note the change in γ is small as discussed above). From Fig. 11.6, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√(γR₁T₁) is also fixed, which in turn would fix the non-dimensional power output (see Fig. 11.7). ","What is the trend in CO emissions when the engine operates at low power, as shown in Fig. 11.29?",CO emissions increase during low power operation.,The figure illustrates a rise in CO levels under low power conditions.,"At low power, there's an upward trend in CO emissions.",CO formation becomes more pronounced with decreased combustion temperature at low power.,"During transient low power operation, CO emissions show an increase."
