Although we have stated that compressor fouling does not normally result in engine failure, the build-up of dirt and deposits during engine operation reduces the capacity and efficiency of the compressor as discussed. Thus a regular clean, normally by washing the compressor, is required to maintain production and profitability. If compressor washing is too frequent, the increase

# Gas turbine performance deterioration

Downtime for washing and cost will affect production adversely due to the unavailability of the engine. Infrequent washing will also reduce production and therefore profit due to the decrease in engine performance due to fouling. Thus there is a need to optimise the compressor wash frequency such that the loss in profit or revenue due to fouling and washing is minimised.

The downtime for engine washing will affect revenue directly. The cost of the wash needs to be added to this lost revenue to determine the total cost due to compressor washing. The lost revenue per annum due to engine washing will be equal to the lost revenue per engine wash, times the number of washes per annum, and will increase with wash frequency, as shown in Fig. 9.19.
