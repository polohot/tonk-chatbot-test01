The nature of compression is to increase the pressure as the flow progresses along the annulus. This adverse pressure gradient, combined with the flow along an annulus, results in an increase in the thickness of the boundary layer along the annulus. The effect of the boundary layer growth is to reduce the flow area along the annulus and this reduces the work input into the stage due to the reduction in the axial velocity in the boundary layer.

The effect of the boundary layer is more profound at the latter stages (high-pressure stages) than at the front or low-pressure stages, due to the boundary layer thickness being the greatest at the high-pressure stages. This blockage effectively reduces the mean axial velocity Ca, thus reducing the stage work as illustrated in Fig. 4.7.

The effect of boundary layer build-up can be allowed for by including a factor λ, known as the work done factor, into Equation 4.2, which gives:

# 4.2.3 Increased blade velocity

From Equation 4.2, the effect of increasing the blade velocity U results in increasing work demand by the compressor stage. The upper limit on increasing U is usually the centrifugal stress on the blade. Increasing the blade velocity is quite desirable because there is generally a reduction in deflection and hence in diffusion, as illustrated by Fig. 4.6. This has the effect of improving the stage efficiency. We observe that the stator diffusion has decreased, and therefore increasing the blade speed increases the reaction of the stage. It is quite possible to increase the blade speed such that the reaction is 50%. This will result in a reduction in both rotor and stator deflection.

The nature of compression is to increase the pressure as the flow progresses along the annulus. This adverse pressure gradient, combined with the flow along an annulus, results in an increase in the thickness of the boundary layer along the annulus. The effect of the boundary layer growth is to reduce the flow area along the annulus and this reduces the work input into the stage due to the reduction in the axial velocity in the boundary layer.

The effect of the boundary layer is more profound at the latter stages (high-pressure stages) than at the front or low-pressure stages, due to the boundary layer thickness being the greatest at the high-pressure stages. This blockage effectively reduces the mean axial velocity Ca, thus reducing the stage work as illustrated in Fig. 4.7.

The effect of boundary layer build-up can be allowed for by including a factor λ, known as the work done factor, into Equation 4.2, which gives:

W = λUCa(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.3]

λ is less than 1.

The variation of the work done factor from stage to stage for a typical compressor is shown in Fig. ",What is the relationship between blade velocity (U) and stator diffusion in a compressor stage?,"Increasing the blade velocity (U) decreases stator diffusion, which can improve the stage efficiency.","Higher blade velocity (U) leads to reduced stator diffusion, enhancing the stage's efficiency.","Stator diffusion diminishes with increased blade velocity (U), contributing to better stage efficiency.","Elevating blade velocity (U) results in lower stator diffusion, thereby increasing stage efficiency.",The efficiency of the stage improves as stator diffusion is reduced by increasing blade velocity (U).

From Equation 4.2 it is evident that the stage work input will increase with the axial velocity, Ca. Increasing Ca also reduces the air flow area required.
