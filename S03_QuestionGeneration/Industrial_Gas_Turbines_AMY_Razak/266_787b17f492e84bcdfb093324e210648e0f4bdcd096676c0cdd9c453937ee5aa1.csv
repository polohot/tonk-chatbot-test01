# 17.2 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power

Simulating the effect of the change in ambient pressure at low operating power is based on the same assumptions as were stated as in Section 17.1. However, the power demand from the generator is reduced to 34 MW, ensuring that no engine operating limits will be encountered during the ambient pressure transient.

It has been seen that the decrease in ambient pressure results in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine when the engine is subjected to an engine operating limit as discussed in Section 17.1. When the engine is operating at a reduced power output, the specific work increases to compensate for the decrease in mass flow rate due to the decrease in ambient pressure, such that the power output remains constant. This is possible because the engine is not constrained by an operating limit such as the exhaust gas.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

The increase in specific work results in an increase in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. The increase in T₃/T₁ also increases the compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine. The increase in these parameters then raises the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 17.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The necessity to increase the specific work to maintain the power demand from the generator results in an increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and thus compressor pressure ratio. As the gas turbine speed and the compressor inlet temperature remain constant, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is forced to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. Thus the increase in compressor pressure ratio is achieved by the operating point moving up the constant non-dimensional speed line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 17.8.

The increase in compressor pressure ratio is shown as a trend in Fig. 17.9. The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. It has been stated that the increase in specific work results in an

Increase in turbine entry temperature, T₃. ",What is the significance of the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁) remaining constant during an ambient pressure transient?,"Constant N₁/√T₁ ensures the operating point moves along a fixed line on the compressor characteristic, adjusting pressure ratio without changing speed.","Keeping N₁/√T₁ constant allows the compressor to adjust its pressure ratio by moving along a specific line on its characteristic, without altering speed.","The constancy of N₁/√T₁ means the compressor can vary its pressure ratio by shifting position on its characteristic curve, maintaining speed.","A steady N₁/√T₁ during the transient enables the compressor to modify its pressure ratio through characteristic curve movement, speed unchanged.","With N₁/√T₁ unchanged, the compressor adjusts its operation along a constant line on the characteristic, varying pressure ratio at the same speed."

# 17.2 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power

Simulating the effect of the change in ambient pressure at low operating power is based on the same assumptions as were stated as in Section 17.1. However, the power demand from the generator is reduced to 34 MW, ensuring that no engine operating limits will be encountered during the ambient pressure transient.

It has been seen that the decrease in ambient pressure results in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine when the engine is subjected to an engine operating limit as discussed in Section 17.1. When the engine is operating at a reduced power output, the specific work increases to compensate for the decrease in mass flow rate due to the decrease in ambient pressure, such that the power output remains constant. This is possible because the engine is not constrained by an operating limit such as the exhaust gas.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

The increase in specific work results in an increase in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. The increase in T₃/T₁ also increases the compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine. The increase in these parameters then raises the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 17.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The necessity to increase the specific work to maintain the power demand from the generator results in an increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and thus compressor pressure ratio. As the gas turbine speed and the compressor inlet temperature remain constant, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is forced to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. Thus the increase in compressor pressure ratio is achieved by the operating point moving up the constant non-dimensional speed line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 17.8.

# 17.2.2 Trends in pressure ratio and temperature ratio

The increase in compressor pressure ratio is shown as a trend in Fig. 17.9. The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. It has been stated that the increase in specific work results in an
