# 18.5.6 Trends in turbine creep life

Figure 18.43 shows the trend in the creep life usage due to hot end damage when operating at low power, and the VIGV operating to maintain the EGT on its limit. In Fig. 18.43 the noticeable decreasing turbine creep life usage is observed in real terms, which is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine metal temperature, although there is an increase in the stress in the turbine material due to the increased power output from the turbine, as seen in Fig. 18.37. This is indeed different to other cases that have been considered, where deterioration in gas turbine performance resulted in an increase in creep life usage in real terms and would generally result in increased life cycle costs due to the higher maintenance cost of the engine. It should be noted that, for a given turbine pressure ratio, the turbine entry temperature would decrease as the turbine efficiency decreases, while operating at a fixed EGT limit.

18.44 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at low power with active VIGV operation. The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, however, results in an increase in the CO emissions, on a mass and emission index basis.

# 19 Power augmentation

For a single-shaft gas turbine, the power output is limited by the EGT at high ambient temperatures and by the power limit at low ambient temperatures. This is necessary to achieve satisfactory turbine blade creep life by preventing the turbine over-heating and also to prevent operational problems such as compressor surge at low ambient temperatures. Unlike the two-shaft gas turbine discussed earlier, the single-shaft gas turbine usually operates at a constant speed so the radial or centrifugal stress will remain constant, although the bending stress will change due to the change in the power produced by the turbine. Thus, the performance-limiting parameters for a single-shaft gas turbine are generally EGT and power limit, unlike a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, where the speeds of the gas generator and the power turbine also limit the power output from the engine.

The limiting values for the EGT and power of the single-shaft gas turbine (simulator), referred to as the base rating case, are as follows:

1. EGT limit 825 K
2. Power limit 45 MW.

The power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures can be increased by raising the EGT limit by about 20 degrees. However, this will have an adverse impact on turbine blade creep life usage and the frequency of engine overhauls may increase, thus increasing the maintenance costs. Such augmentation of the power by increasing the EGT limit is often referred to as peak rating and is very similar to the case discussed for the two-shaft gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited to reduce creep life usage, which can then be utilised at high ambient temperatures by increasing the EGT limit. In aero-gas turbines, this is referred to as flat rating, where the takeoff thrust can be increased on hot days, while the engine throttles are adjusted to provide only the required thrust on cold days (rating curves as discussed above in Chapter 11, Section 11.3.8).

# Power augmentation

The power output at low ambient temperature also helps maintain adequate surge margin as discussed in Chapter 16. The power output from the gas turbine can be increased at low ambient temperatures by increasing the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. This has the effect of maintaining an adequate compressor surge margin by reducing the compressor pressure ratio. It also lowers the turbine entry temperature for a given EGT thus minimising the effect on increased creep life usage at these increased power output conditions at low ambient temperatures. However, the performance of the gas turbine is reduced at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output. Thus, such modifications to the turbine section should only be considered if a substantial amount of operation occurs at lower limiting conditions. But such modifications will result in reduced turbine blade creep life usage at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine and this is discussed later.

As with the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the power output from a single-shaft gas turbine may be increased by water and steam injected directly into the combustor because of the increased flow rate through the turbine relative to the compressor. Alternatively, water may also be injected into the inlet system and the resultant evaporation produces a cooling effect (evaporative), thus increasing the power output from the gas turbine due to the reduction in compressor inlet temperature. Such power augmentation is often referred to as turbine inlet cooling (TIC). The impact of both direct water injection and turbine inlet cooling on power augmentation will be considered in this section.

Another means of augmenting the power output of a single-shaft gas turbine is to increase the air flow through the engine. This can be achieved by opening the VIGV and a useful increase in power output is possible by using such a technique.

The single-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and their impact on performance, turbine blade life creep usage and emissions will be determined.

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 60 MW (maximum capacity of the generator), thus ensuring that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. Peak rating is simulated by increasing the EGT limit by 20 degrees to 845 K. To consider the impact of peak rating at different ambient temperatures, the ambient temperature is changed from 35 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the EGT limit will result in an increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. To satisfy the flow compatibility between the

compressor and turbine, there is also an increase in the compressor pressure ratio. The increases in these two performance parameters increase the power output and the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 19.1 and 19.2, respectively.

At high ambient temperature (30 degrees Celsius), the increase in power output is over 5%. Comparing the increase in power output with the case of

# Power augmentation

The two-shaft gas turbine, peak rating the two-shaft gas turbine is observed to give about a 7% increase in power output. In the case of the single-shaft gas turbine, for a given compressor inlet temperature, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant. Thus, the compressor mass flow rate and therefore the mass flow rate through the gas turbine remain constant, due to peak rating at a given ambient temperature. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the gas generator speed increases with the increase in EGT, as the gas generator speed does not limit the power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures. This results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in mass flow rate through the engine, hence the greater increase in power output from the two-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating. In general, and for the same increase in the EGT limit, peak rating a two-shaft gas turbine results in a greater increase in the percentage power output for this reason.

The increase in the thermal efficiency of the single-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating is shown in Fig. 19.2. At high ambient temperature, there is about a 1% increase in thermal efficiency and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and T₃/T₁. A slightly higher increase in thermal efficiency is observed with the peak-rated two-shaft gas turbine. For a given increase in T₃/T₁, the increase in the gas generator speed results in a higher compressor pressure ratio due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The higher compressor pressure ratio results in a better thermal efficiency due to peak rating of the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

The higher EGT will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature and thus an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# Power augmentation

The two-shaft gas turbine, peak rating the two-shaft gas turbine is observed to give about a 7% increase in power output. In the case of the single-shaft gas turbine, for a given compressor inlet temperature, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant. Thus, the compressor mass flow rate and therefore the mass flow rate through the gas turbine remain constant, due to peak rating at a given ambient temperature. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the gas generator speed increases with the increase in EGT, as the gas generator speed does not limit the power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures. This results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in mass flow rate through the engine, hence the greater increase in power output from the two-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating. In general, and for the same increase in the EGT limit, peak rating a two-shaft gas turbine results in a greater increase in the percentage power output for this reason.

The increase in the thermal efficiency of the single-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating is shown in Fig. 19.2. At high ambient temperature, there is about a 1% increase in thermal efficiency and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and T₃/T₁. A slightly higher increase in thermal efficiency is observed with the peak-rated two-shaft gas turbine. For a given increase in T₃/T₁, the increase in the gas generator speed results in a higher compressor pressure ratio due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The higher compressor pressure ratio results in a better thermal efficiency due to peak rating of the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

The higher EGT will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature and thus an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. ",What are the performance-limiting parameters for a single-shaft gas turbine?,"The performance-limiting parameters are the EGT and power limit, ensuring turbine blade creep life and preventing operational issues like compressor surge.","EGT and power limit are the key constraints, safeguarding against overheating and surge, respectively, in single-shaft gas turbines.",Single-shaft gas turbines are primarily limited by EGT to prevent overheating and by power output to avoid surge at low ambient temperatures.,"Limitations include maintaining EGT within bounds to protect turbine blades and adjusting power to prevent surge, especially in varying ambient conditions.","The main constraints are the EGT, to avoid excessive turbine temperatures, and the power limit, to ensure operational stability across different ambient temperatures."

In Fig. 18.43 the noticeable decreasing turbine creep life usage is observed in real terms, which is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine metal temperature, although there is an increase in the stress in the turbine material due to the increased power output from the turbine, as seen in Fig. 18.37. This is indeed different to other cases that have been considered, where deterioration in gas turbine performance resulted in an increase in creep life usage in real terms and would generally result in increased life cycle costs due to the higher maintenance cost of the engine. It should be noted that, for a given turbine pressure ratio, the turbine entry temperature would decrease as the turbine efficiency decreases, while operating at a fixed EGT limit.

# 19 Power augmentation

For a single-shaft gas turbine, the power output is limited by the EGT at high ambient temperatures and by the power limit at low ambient temperatures. This is necessary to achieve satisfactory turbine blade creep life by preventing the turbine over-heating and also to prevent operational problems such as compressor surge at low ambient temperatures. Unlike the two-shaft gas turbine discussed earlier, the single-shaft gas turbine usually operates at a constant speed so the radial or centrifugal stress will remain constant, although the bending stress will change due to the change in the power produced by the turbine. Thus, the performance-limiting parameters for a single-shaft gas turbine are generally EGT and power limit, unlike a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, where the speeds of the gas generator and the power turbine also limit the power output from the engine.

The limiting values for the EGT and power of the single-shaft gas turbine (simulator), referred to as the base rating case, are as follows:

1. EGT limit 825 K
2. Power limit 45 MW.

The power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures can be increased by raising the EGT limit by about 20 degrees. However, this will have an adverse impact on turbine blade creep life usage and the frequency of engine overhauls may increase, thus increasing the maintenance costs. Such augmentation of the power by increasing the EGT limit is often referred to as peak rating and is very similar to the case discussed for the two-shaft gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited to reduce creep life usage, which can then be utilised at high ambient temperatures by increasing the EGT limit. In aero-gas turbines, this is referred to as flat rating, where the takeoff thrust can be increased on hot days, while the engine throttles are adjusted to provide only the required thrust on cold days (rating curves as discussed above in Chapter 11, Section 11.3.8).

# Power augmentation

The power output at low ambient temperature also helps maintain adequate surge margin as discussed in Chapter 16. The power output from the gas turbine can be increased at low ambient temperatures by increasing the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. This has the effect of maintaining an adequate compressor surge margin by reducing the compressor pressure ratio. It also lowers the turbine entry temperature for a given EGT thus minimising the effect on increased creep life usage at these increased power output conditions at low ambient temperatures. However, the performance of the gas turbine is reduced at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output. Thus, such modifications to the turbine section should only be considered if a substantial amount of operation occurs at lower limiting conditions. But such modifications will result in reduced turbine blade creep life usage at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine and this is discussed later.

As with the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the power output from a single-shaft gas turbine may be increased by water and steam injected directly into the combustor because of the increased flow rate through the turbine relative to the compressor. Alternatively, water may also be injected into the inlet system and the resultant evaporation produces a cooling effect (evaporative), thus increasing the power output from the gas turbine due to the reduction in compressor inlet temperature. Such power augmentation is often referred to as turbine inlet cooling (TIC). The impact of both direct water injection and turbine inlet cooling on power augmentation will be considered in this section.

Another means of augmenting the power output of a single-shaft gas turbine is to increase the air flow through the engine. This can be achieved by opening the VIGV and a useful increase in power output is possible by using such a technique.

The single-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and their impact on performance, turbine blade life creep usage and emissions will be determined.

This is necessary to achieve satisfactory turbine blade creep life by preventing the turbine over-heating and also to prevent operational problems such as compressor surge at low ambient temperatures. Unlike the two-shaft gas turbine discussed earlier, the single-shaft gas turbine usually operates at a constant speed so the radial or centrifugal stress will remain constant, although the bending stress will change due to the change in the power produced by the turbine. Thus, the performance-limiting parameters for a single-shaft gas turbine are generally EGT and power limit, unlike a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, where the speeds of the gas generator and the power turbine also limit the power output from the engine.

The limiting values for the EGT and power of the single-shaft gas turbine (simulator), referred to as the base rating case, are as follows:

1. EGT limit 825 K
2. Power limit 45 MW.

The power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures can be increased by raising the EGT limit by about 20 degrees. However, this will have an adverse impact on turbine blade creep life usage and the frequency of engine overhauls may increase, thus increasing the maintenance costs. Such augmentation of the power by increasing the EGT limit is often referred to as peak rating and is very similar to the case discussed for the two-shaft gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited to reduce creep life usage, which can then be utilised at high ambient temperatures by increasing the EGT limit. In aero-gas turbines, this is referred to as flat rating, where the takeoff thrust can be increased on hot days, while the engine throttles are adjusted to provide only the required thrust on cold days (rating curves as discussed above in Chapter 11, Section 11.3.8).

# Power augmentation

The power output at low ambient temperature also helps maintain adequate surge margin as discussed in Chapter 16. The power output from the gas turbine can be increased at low ambient temperatures by increasing the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. This has the effect of maintaining an adequate compressor surge margin by reducing the compressor pressure ratio. It also lowers the turbine entry temperature for a given EGT thus minimising the effect on increased creep life usage at these increased power output conditions at low ambient temperatures. However, the performance of the gas turbine is reduced at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output. Thus, such modifications to the turbine section should only be considered if a substantial amount of operation occurs at lower limiting conditions. But such modifications will result in reduced turbine blade creep life usage at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine and this is discussed later.

As with the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the power output from a single-shaft gas turbine may be increased by water and steam injected directly into the combustor because of the increased flow rate through the turbine relative to the compressor. Alternatively, water may also be injected into the inlet system and the resultant evaporation produces a cooling effect (evaporative), thus increasing the power output from the gas turbine due to the reduction in compressor inlet temperature. Such power augmentation is often referred to as turbine inlet cooling (TIC). The impact of both direct water injection and turbine inlet cooling on power augmentation will be considered in this section.

Another means of augmenting the power output of a single-shaft gas turbine is to increase the air flow through the engine. This can be achieved by opening the VIGV and a useful increase in power output is possible by using such a technique.

The single-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and their impact on performance, turbine blade life creep usage and emissions will be determined.

# 19.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 60 MW (maximum capacity of the generator), thus ensuring that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. Peak rating is simulated by increasing the EGT limit by 20 degrees to 845 K. To consider the impact of peak rating at different ambient temperatures, the ambient temperature is changed from 35 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the EGT limit will result in an increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. To satisfy the flow compatibility between the

compressor and turbine, there is also an increase in the compressor pressure ratio. The increases in these two performance parameters increase the power output and the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 19.1 and 19.2, respectively.

At high ambient temperature (30 degrees Celsius), the increase in power output is over 5%. Comparing the increase in power output with the case of

# Power augmentation

The two-shaft gas turbine, peak rating the two-shaft gas turbine is observed to give about a 7% increase in power output. In the case of the single-shaft gas turbine, for a given compressor inlet temperature, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant. Thus, the compressor mass flow rate and therefore the mass flow rate through the gas turbine remain constant, due to peak rating at a given ambient temperature. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the gas generator speed increases with the increase in EGT, as the gas generator speed does not limit the power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures. This results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in mass flow rate through the engine, hence the greater increase in power output from the two-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating. In general, and for the same increase in the EGT limit, peak rating a two-shaft gas turbine results in a greater increase in the percentage power output for this reason.

The increase in the thermal efficiency of the single-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating is shown in Fig. 19.2. At high ambient temperature, there is about a 1% increase in thermal efficiency and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and T₃/T₁. A slightly higher increase in thermal efficiency is observed with the peak-rated two-shaft gas turbine. For a given increase in T₃/T₁, the increase in the gas generator speed results in a higher compressor pressure ratio due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The higher compressor pressure ratio results in a better thermal efficiency due to peak rating of the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

The higher EGT will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature and thus an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

Figure 18.43 shows the trend in the creep life usage due to hot end damage when operating at low power, and the VIGV operating to maintain the EGT on its limit. In Fig. 18.43 the noticeable decreasing turbine creep life usage is observed in real terms, which is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine metal temperature, although there is an increase in the stress in the turbine material due to the increased power output from the turbine, as seen in Fig. 18.37. This is indeed different to other cases that have been considered, where deterioration in gas turbine performance resulted in an increase in creep life usage in real terms and would generally result in increased life cycle costs due to the higher maintenance cost of the engine. It should be noted that, for a given turbine pressure ratio, the turbine entry temperature would decrease as the turbine efficiency decreases, while operating at a fixed EGT limit.

In Fig. 18.43 the noticeable decreasing turbine creep life usage is observed in real terms, which is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine metal temperature, although there is an increase in the stress in the turbine material due to the increased power output from the turbine, as seen in Fig. 18.37. This is indeed different to other cases that have been considered, where deterioration in gas turbine performance resulted in an increase in creep life usage in real terms and would generally result in increased life cycle costs due to the higher maintenance cost of the engine. It should be noted that, for a given turbine pressure ratio, the turbine entry temperature would decrease as the turbine efficiency decreases, while operating at a fixed EGT limit.

# 19 Power augmentation

For a single-shaft gas turbine, the power output is limited by the EGT at high ambient temperatures and by the power limit at low ambient temperatures. This is necessary to achieve satisfactory turbine blade creep life by preventing the turbine over-heating and also to prevent operational problems such as compressor surge at low ambient temperatures. Unlike the two-shaft gas turbine discussed earlier, the single-shaft gas turbine usually operates at a constant speed so the radial or centrifugal stress will remain constant, although the bending stress will change due to the change in the power produced by the turbine. Thus, the performance-limiting parameters for a single-shaft gas turbine are generally EGT and power limit, unlike a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, where the speeds of the gas generator and the power turbine also limit the power output from the engine.

The limiting values for the EGT and power of the single-shaft gas turbine (simulator), referred to as the base rating case, are as follows:

1. EGT limit 825 K
2. Power limit 45 MW.

The power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures can be increased by raising the EGT limit by about 20 degrees. However, this will have an adverse impact on turbine blade creep life usage and the frequency of engine overhauls may increase, thus increasing the maintenance costs. Such augmentation of the power by increasing the EGT limit is often referred to as peak rating and is very similar to the case discussed for the two-shaft gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited to reduce creep life usage, which can then be utilised at high ambient temperatures by increasing the EGT limit. In aero-gas turbines, this is referred to as flat rating, where the takeoff thrust can be increased on hot days, while the engine throttles are adjusted to provide only the required thrust on cold days (rating curves as discussed above in Chapter 11, Section 11.3.8).

# Power augmentation

The power output at low ambient temperature also helps maintain adequate surge margin as discussed in Chapter 16. The power output from the gas turbine can be increased at low ambient temperatures by increasing the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. This has the effect of maintaining an adequate compressor surge margin by reducing the compressor pressure ratio. It also lowers the turbine entry temperature for a given EGT thus minimising the effect on increased creep life usage at these increased power output conditions at low ambient temperatures. However, the performance of the gas turbine is reduced at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output. Thus, such modifications to the turbine section should only be considered if a substantial amount of operation occurs at lower limiting conditions. But such modifications will result in reduced turbine blade creep life usage at high ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine and this is discussed later.

As with the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the power output from a single-shaft gas turbine may be increased by water and steam injected directly into the combustor because of the increased flow rate through the turbine relative to the compressor. Alternatively, water may also be injected into the inlet system and the resultant evaporation produces a cooling effect (evaporative), thus increasing the power output from the gas turbine due to the reduction in compressor inlet temperature. Such power augmentation is often referred to as turbine inlet cooling (TIC). The impact of both direct water injection and turbine inlet cooling on power augmentation will be considered in this section.

Another means of augmenting the power output of a single-shaft gas turbine is to increase the air flow through the engine. This can be achieved by opening the VIGV and a useful increase in power output is possible by using such a technique.

The single-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and their impact on performance, turbine blade life creep usage and emissions will be determined.

# 19.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 60 MW (maximum capacity of the generator), thus ensuring that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. Peak rating is simulated by increasing the EGT limit by 20 degrees to 845 K. To consider the impact of peak rating at different ambient temperatures, the ambient temperature is changed from 35 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the EGT limit will result in an increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. To satisfy the flow compatibility between the

compressor and turbine, there is also an increase in the compressor pressure ratio. The increases in these two performance parameters increase the power output and the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 19.1 and 19.2, respectively.

At high ambient temperature (30 degrees Celsius), the increase in power output is over 5%. Comparing the increase in power output with the case of

# Power augmentation

The two-shaft gas turbine, peak rating the two-shaft gas turbine is observed to give about a 7% increase in power output. In the case of the single-shaft gas turbine, for a given compressor inlet temperature, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant. Thus, the compressor mass flow rate and therefore the mass flow rate through the gas turbine remain constant, due to peak rating at a given ambient temperature. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the gas generator speed increases with the increase in EGT, as the gas generator speed does not limit the power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures. This results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in mass flow rate through the engine, hence the greater increase in power output from the two-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating. In general, and for the same increase in the EGT limit, peak rating a two-shaft gas turbine results in a greater increase in the percentage power output for this reason.

The increase in the thermal efficiency of the single-shaft gas turbine due to peak rating is shown in Fig. 19.2. At high ambient temperature, there is about a 1% increase in thermal efficiency and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and T₃/T₁. A slightly higher increase in thermal efficiency is observed with the peak-rated two-shaft gas turbine. For a given increase in T₃/T₁, the increase in the gas generator speed results in a higher compressor pressure ratio due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The higher compressor pressure ratio results in a better thermal efficiency due to peak rating of the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

The higher EGT will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature and thus an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. ",How does peak rating a single-shaft gas turbine compare to a two-shaft gas turbine in terms of power output increase?,A two-shaft gas turbine experiences a greater percentage increase in power output (about 7%) compared to a single-shaft (over 5%) for the same EGT limit increase.,"The two-shaft design allows for a higher power boost (7%) than the single-shaft (5+%), due to increased mass flow rate from higher gas generator speed.","Two-shaft turbines outperform single-shaft in power augmentation via peak rating, achieving a 7% vs. 5% increase, thanks to enhanced mass flow.","Compared to single-shaft, two-shaft gas turbines achieve a larger power increase (7% vs. 5%) when peak rated, owing to greater mass flow adjustments.","The two-shaft configuration enables a more significant power output rise (7%) than single-shaft (5%), facilitated by its ability to increase mass flow more effectively."
