# 2.1 Representation of a heat engine.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system. ",What is the significance of the initial and final states being identical in a thermodynamic cycle?,"In a thermodynamic cycle, the initial and final states being identical signifies that the system returns to its original state after completing the cycle, allowing the cycle to be repeated continuously.","The identical initial and final states in a thermodynamic cycle indicate that the system's properties, such as temperature and pressure, return to their starting values, enabling the cycle to operate indefinitely.","This condition ensures that the thermodynamic cycle can be used for continuous operation, as the system's state variables reset to their original values after each cycle.","Having identical initial and final states means the system undergoes no net change over one complete cycle, which is essential for the sustained operation of heat engines.","The requirement for identical initial and final states in a cycle underscores the cyclic nature of thermodynamic processes, facilitating the continuous conversion of heat into work."

# 2.1 Representation of a heat engine.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system. ",What does the steady flow energy equation represent in thermodynamics?,"The steady flow energy equation represents the first law of thermodynamics for open systems, balancing heat input, work output, and enthalpy change in continuous processes.","It encapsulates energy conservation for systems with steady mass flow, relating heat, work, and the change in total enthalpy.","This equation is crucial for analyzing continuous flow systems, linking thermal energy, mechanical work, and fluid energy changes.","It provides a framework for understanding energy transformations in devices like turbines and compressors, where flow is steady.","Representing a balance of energy rates, it's essential for designing and evaluating steady-flow thermodynamic systems."

One definition of the second law limits the amount of work that can be produced. In other words, if we supply 10 MJ (Q₁) of heat to produce work (W), we can only develop less than 10 MJ of work, because the heat rejected to the sink, Q₂, cannot be zero. Therefore, the efficiency of a heat engine, which is the ratio of the work output, W, and the heat input, Q₁, can never be unity, because some heat must always be rejected by the system (i.e. Q₂ cannot be zero).

The immediate question that arises is ‘what is the maximum efficiency a heat engine can produce’? This is best answered by using the Carnot efficiency.
