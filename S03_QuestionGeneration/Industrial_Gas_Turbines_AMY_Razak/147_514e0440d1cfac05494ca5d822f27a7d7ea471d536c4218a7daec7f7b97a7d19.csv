1. gas generator compressor inlet temperature
2. gas generator compressor inlet pressure
3. gas generator compressor exit temperature
4. gas generator compressor exit pressure
5. gas generator turbine exit temperature (EGT)
6. gas generator turbine exit pressure
7. power turbine exit temperature
8. power turbine exit pressure
9. fuel flow
10. gas generator speed
11. power turbine speed.

Note the absence of the power measurement for the case of the two-shaft gas turbine described above. Six fault indices can now be determined for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. They correspond to the gas generator compressor fouling and efficiency fault index; gas generator turbine fouling and efficiency fault index; and the power turbine fouling and efficiency fault index.

The measurement of specific humidity should also be included, particularly at high ambient temperatures where the change in specific humidity with relative humidity is significant. As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.11.1), a change in specific humidity will have a noticeable affect on the thermodynamic properties of air and products of combustion, hence influencing the engine performance, as shown in Fig. 11.30. ",How does specific humidity affect gas turbine performance according to the text?,"Changes in specific humidity influence the thermodynamic properties of air and combustion products, thereby affecting engine performance.","The text links specific humidity variations to changes in air and combustion properties, impacting performance.",Specific humidity affects performance by altering the thermodynamic characteristics of air and combustion products.,It impacts performance through its effect on the thermodynamic properties of air and combustion products.,The text states that specific humidity changes can noticeably influence engine performance by affecting air and combustion thermodynamics.

1. compressor inlet temperature
2. compressor inlet pressure
3. compressor exit temperature
4. compressor exit pressure
5. turbine exit temperature (exhaust gas temperature, EGT)
6. turbine exit pressure
7. fuel flow
8. gas turbine speed
9. gas turbine power output
10. variable inlet guide vane/variable stator vane position if applicable.

Single shaft gas turbines are often used in power generation and the gas turbine power output can be determined from the generator output. The total number of fault indices is four and they correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and to the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices.

A similar approach can be used to determine the fault indices for other engine configurations discussed earlier. For a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine the required measurements are:

# Gas turbine performance deterioration

# Start

Initialise all fault indices to zero

Run the engine model at the operating conditions (i.e. run the model at the measured compressor inlet pressure and temperature, turbine exit pressure, power output and VIGV position)
