# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

# 17.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at high power

In this section the change in gas turbine performance due to the ambient pressure transient will be considered when the engine is operating at high power. A constant ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius has been selected and therefore the power output from the gas turbine is always limited by the exhaust gas temperature during this transient.

# 17.1.1 Compressor characteristic

Since the gas turbine speed and the compressor inlet temperature remain constant (constant ambient temperature), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, will also remain constant. If it is assumed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃, is constant, then the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, will remain constant. For a given compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, will not vary very much with compressor pressure ratio, due to nearly vertical speed lines. Furthermore, the choked conditions that prevail in the turbine will maintain a constant turbine inlet non-dimensional flow, W₃√T₃/P₃. To satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.1, the compressor pressure ratio will also be nearly constant. A constant compressor ratio also implies an approximately constant turbine pressure ratio and a constant compressor exit temperature, T₂. If operation is at a constant turbine entry temperature, the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) will also be constant.

Since the engine performance is limited by the EGT (high-power case), from the above analysis, any decrease in the ambient pressure and thus compressor inlet pressure, P₁, will not have any effect on the operating point on the compressor characteristic, provided an EGT limit is maintained as the ambient pressure changes. This can be seen in Fig. ",How is the high-power operating condition simulated in the study?,By setting the power demand from the generator so the engine always operates at its limit.,The simulation ensures the engine reaches an operating limit by adjusting generator power demand.,High-power condition is achieved by making the engine hit an operating limit through specific power demands.,It involves configuring the generator's power demand to keep the engine at an operating limit.,Simulating high-power involves setting power demands that push the engine to its operational limits.
