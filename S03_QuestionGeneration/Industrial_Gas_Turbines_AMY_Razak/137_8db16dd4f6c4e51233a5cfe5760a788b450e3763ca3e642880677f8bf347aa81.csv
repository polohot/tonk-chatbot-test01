This linkage enables the turbines to work together, even when there is a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio and the work produced by the HP turbine decreases. As a result, the compressor operating point and turbine entry temperature can be maintained at their design values without the need for variable geometry in the turbine. This power transfer mechanism is particularly beneficial in applications such as two-shaft gas turbines with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power can be transferred using clutches.

As the operating conditions deviate from the design specifications, the compressor may experience shifts in its performance characteristics, which can be represented on a characteristic map.

1. **LP and HP Compressor Characteristics**: The operating points for both low-pressure (LP) and high-pressure (HP) compressors are affected by changes in turbine entry temperature and pressure ratios. For instance, as the turbine entry temperature increases or decreases, the operating point on the compressor characteristic maps will shift accordingly.

2. **Surge Line and Running Line**: The surge line represents the boundary beyond which the compressor will stall. During off-design operation, the operating point may move closer to this surge line, particularly if the compressor is not operating at its optimal flow conditions. The running line, which indicates the actual operating performance of the compressor, may also shift due to changes in the non-dimensional speed and flow.

3. **Reheating Effects**: In the case of reheating, particularly in three-shaft gas turbines, the operating points on the LP and HP compressor characteristics can change significantly. The introduction of reheating allows for better maintenance of turbine entry temperatures, which can help optimize performance even during off-design conditions.

4. **Non-Dimensional Parameters**: The behavior of gas turbines is inherently non-dimensional, meaning that for any given non-dimensional speed, there is a unique corresponding value for other parameters such as pressure ratio and mass flow. This non-dimensional nature allows for a consistent representation of performance changes across different operating conditions.

5. **Impact of Ambient Conditions**: The performance of gas turbines is sensitive to ambient conditions, and operators often need to correct performance data to standard atmospheric conditions. This correction process involves equating non-dimensional parameters at actual and standard conditions, which can also influence the operating point during off-design scenarios.

In summary, during off-design operation, the operating point of a gas turbine compressor can shift due to changes in temperature, pressure ratios, and ambient conditions, which can affect the overall performance and efficiency of the gas turbine system."

When the ambient temperature increases, such as in tropical environments where temperatures can reach around 30 degrees Celsius, the performance of the gas turbine may decrease compared to standard conditions, which are typically set at 15 degrees Celsius (288.15 K). 

Higher ambient temperatures can lead to reduced air density, which in turn affects the mass flow rate into the compressor. This reduction in mass flow can decrease the overall efficiency and power output of the gas turbine. Conversely, in cooler environments, such as Nordic countries where temperatures can average around 0 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine may perform better due to increased air density, allowing for more efficient combustion and higher power output.

To accurately compare the performance of gas turbines under varying ambient conditions, operators often correct the performance data to standard atmospheric conditions.

However, in different environments, such as tropical regions where the ambient temperature is around 30 degrees Celsius, or in Nordic countries where it can be as low as 0 degrees Celsius, adjustments must be made to accurately assess turbine performance.

To correct the engine performance to these varying ambient temperatures, the actual power and other parameters (like fuel flow and airflow) are adjusted using non-dimensional parameters. This involves equating the non-dimensional power and ambient conditions at the actual operating temperature to those at the standard conditions. The correction is achieved through equations that factor in the actual ambient conditions (temperature and pressure) and their corresponding standard values.
