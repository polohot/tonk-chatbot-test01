# 32 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The simple cycle gas turbine performance also depends on T₃ and improves as T₃ increases. Similarly, it can be shown that the thermal efficiency of the actual or practical gas turbine increases with decrease in the minimum cycle temperature T₁. In fact, the practical gas turbine thermal efficiency is dependent on the pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

# 2.10 Effect of pressure losses on gas turbine performance

The heat addition and the heat rejection in an ideal gas turbine cycle occur at constant pressure. In a practical gas turbine the heat is supplied by burning fuel in a combustor. The combustor and the heat addition process incur pressure losses and therefore the heat addition is not a constant pressure process in a practical gas turbine cycle. Similarly, the heat sink in a practical gas turbine cycle is the atmosphere, and the ductwork to remove the exhaust gases from the gas turbine will also incur a pressure loss. Furthermore, practical gas turbines normally operate on open cycles and air is drawn in continuously to provide fresh working fluid for the gas turbine. As a result, there is also a pressure loss in the inlet system.

The combustion pressure loss varies from about 1% of the compressor discharge pressure for an industrial gas turbine to about 5% for an aero-derived gas turbine. Inlet and exhaust losses are much smaller and a typical pressure loss is about 10 mBar. Pressure losses that occur in the combustion, inlet and exhaust systems reduce the turbine work output and increase the compressor work absorbed, therefore increasing the sensitivity of the cycle performance to cycle temperatures, namely T₃/T₁. Figure 2.14 shows the temperature–entropy diagram of a practical gas turbine cycle including combustor inlet and exhaust system losses.

# 2.11 Variation of specific heats

In the ideal gas turbine cycle we have assumed that the specific heat, cₚ, and the isentropic index, γ, which is the ratio of specific heats (cₚ/cv), are constant during the various thermodynamic processes. In practice, however, the specific heats vary during compression, heat addition and expansion. In open cycle gas turbines, air is the working fluid and, at the normal operating pressures and temperatures that occur in a gas turbine cycle, the specific heat is only a function of temperature (i.e. air acts as a perfect gas).

Furthermore, the burning of fuel changes the composition of the air to products of combustion, hence this change is another factor affecting the specific heat and the isentropic index. The specific heats for air and products of combustion may be expressed as a polynomial in temperature or as an

Equation as a function of temperature, as shown by Equation 2.44. The ratios of specific heats, γ, may then be calculated from Equation 2.45. Further discussion on thermo-physical properties of air and products of combustion applicable to gas turbines are discussed in Walsh and Fletcher.4

c = T (T)–2 [2.44]

where

- T is temperature in K
- a, b and c are constants for a given gas; their values are given in Table 2.1. They have been taken from Harman.5
- cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure whose units are J/kg K.

temperature, we calculate the specific heat cₚ for each component of air from Equation 2.44 using the corresponding constants a, b and c given above. The specific heat, cₚ, of air for a given temperature is then computed by:

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

where cₚN₂, cₚO₂, cₚAr and cₚCO₂ in Equation 2.47 are the specific heats for N₂, O₂, Ar and CO₂ at the given temperature, respectively, and are calculated by Equation 2.44 using the data given in Table 2.1.

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values. New cₚ and γ values at exit are computed as described above and the process repeated. However, at the start of the subsequent iteration, the values for cₚ and γ are based on the average temperature change in the compression or expansion process. After each iterative step, the current values of γ, cₚ and at the exit of the compressor or turbine are compared with the values of the previous iteration. The iterative process is repeated until there is sufficient agreement between the current and previous values of cₚ and γ.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

# 2.11.1 Effect of humidity

The above analysis considers the calculation of gas properties such as cₚ and γ for dry air. However, air contains water vapour and, at high ambient temperatures, the effect of humidity can be significant and has to be accounted.

# 36 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for in the calculation of the gas properties. The humidity of air is presented normally as the amount of water vapour needed to saturate the air and is referred to as the relative humidity. It is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure to the saturated water pressure and is given in Equation 2.48.

φ =  p  × 100                                                [2.48]

pₛ

where p is vapour pressure of water,

pₛ is the saturated water vapour pressure

and φ is the relative humidity as a percentage. The units for  p and  pₛ are normally in millibars.

The saturated vapour pressure,  pₛ, can be determined from:

17.67×T

p  = 6.112 ×

s           e T+ 243.5                                     [2.49]

where T is the ambient temperature in Celsius.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

ω =  massʷ                                                  [2.50]

Using Dalton’s laws of partial pressures, Equation 2.50 can be represented as:

ω = 0.622   p                                               [2.51]

P – p

where P is the ambient pressure in millibars (mb).

Given the relative humidity, ambient pressure and temperature, the mass of water vapour can be determined using the equations discussed in this section. This can be incorporated in the specific heat calculations, where the

cp humid is now given by:

cp humid = cp air × mf air + cp water × mf water             [2.52]

where

cₚ humid = specific heat at constant pressure for humid air

c  cₚ air = specific heat at constant pressure of dry air

p water = specific heat at constant pressure of water vapour

mf air = mass of dry air in 1 kg of humid air

mf water = mass of water vapour in 1 kg of humid air.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Clearly, specific humidity and relative humidity are related. This can be illustrated on the psychrometric chart shown in Fig. 2.16. For a given increase in relative humidity, there is also an increase in specific humidity. However, the increase in specific humidity and therefore the change in the mass of vapour in the air, are small at low ambient temperature, and are shown as the dry bulb temperature. It is at high ambient temperatures that the effects of humidity are noticeable in performance calculations. It should be pointed out that Fig. 2.16 is valid only for a given ambient pressure that corresponds to 1 bar. The impact of humidity on engine performance is discussed in Mathioudakis et al.7

# 2.12 Enthalpy and entropy

Although the use of mean specific heats in performance calculations gives good accuracy to within 1%, for rigorous calculations, enthalpy and entropy should be used. The specific enthalpy of a gas may be given by:

where HR is the residual property and is given by:

HR = –RT2 ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP const T[2.54]

independent of pressures and temperatures that occur in gas turbines. Thus Hᴿ can be considered to be zero. Therefore Equation 2.53 reduces to:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT [2.55]

The specific heat, cp, is a polynomial in temperature T or a suitable equation such as that defined by Equation 2.44. The units for specific enthalpy are kJ/kg. Since the first and second law of thermodynamics do not permit the calculation of the absolute value enthalpy, we need a reference temperature where the enthalpy is zero (usually 273 K). However, in gas turbine performance calculations, the reference specific enthalpy is unimportant as our interest is in the change in specific enthalpy in such calculations. A similar argument holds for entropy, which will be discussed next.

The specific entropy of a gas may be given as:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0 + S[2.56]

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0[2.58]

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

ηisen = H²′ – H¹  for compression                             [2.59]

H2  – H1

or

ηisen =  H²  – H¹  for expansion                              [2.60]

H2′ – H1

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁).

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

ηisen = H²′ – H¹  for compression                             [2.59]

H2  – H1

or

ηisen =  H²  – H¹  for expansion                              [2.60]

H2′ – H1

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁).

The simple cycle gas turbine performance also depends on T₃ and improves as T₃ increases. Similarly, it can be shown that the thermal efficiency of the actual or practical gas turbine increases with decrease in the minimum cycle temperature T₁. In fact, the practical gas turbine thermal efficiency is dependent on the pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

# 2.10 Effect of pressure losses on gas turbine performance

The heat addition and the heat rejection in an ideal gas turbine cycle occur at constant pressure. In a practical gas turbine the heat is supplied by burning fuel in a combustor. The combustor and the heat addition process incur pressure losses and therefore the heat addition is not a constant pressure process in a practical gas turbine cycle. Similarly, the heat sink in a practical gas turbine cycle is the atmosphere, and the ductwork to remove the exhaust gases from the gas turbine will also incur a pressure loss. Furthermore, practical gas turbines normally operate on open cycles and air is drawn in continuously to provide fresh working fluid for the gas turbine. As a result, there is also a pressure loss in the inlet system.

The combustion pressure loss varies from about 1% of the compressor discharge pressure for an industrial gas turbine to about 5% for an aero-derived gas turbine. Inlet and exhaust losses are much smaller and a typical pressure loss is about 10 mBar. Pressure losses that occur in the combustion, inlet and exhaust systems reduce the turbine work output and increase the compressor work absorbed, therefore increasing the sensitivity of the cycle performance to cycle temperatures, namely T₃/T₁. Figure 2.14 shows the temperature–entropy diagram of a practical gas turbine cycle including combustor inlet and exhaust system losses.

# 2.11 Variation of specific heats

In the ideal gas turbine cycle we have assumed that the specific heat, cₚ, and the isentropic index, γ, which is the ratio of specific heats (cₚ/cv), are constant during the various thermodynamic processes. In practice, however, the specific heats vary during compression, heat addition and expansion. In open cycle gas turbines, air is the working fluid and, at the normal operating pressures and temperatures that occur in a gas turbine cycle, the specific heat is only a function of temperature (i.e. air acts as a perfect gas).

Furthermore, the burning of fuel changes the composition of the air to products of combustion, hence this change is another factor affecting the specific heat and the isentropic index. The specific heats for air and products of combustion may be expressed as a polynomial in temperature or as an

c = T (T)–2 [2.44]

- T is temperature in K
- a, b and c are constants for a given gas; their values are given in Table 2.1. They have been taken from Harman.5

temperature, we calculate the specific heat cₚ for each component of air from Equation 2.44 using the corresponding constants a, b and c given above. The specific heat, cₚ, of air for a given temperature is then computed by:

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

where cₚN₂, cₚO₂, cₚAr and cₚCO₂ in Equation 2.47 are the specific heats for N₂, O₂, Ar and CO₂ at the given temperature, respectively, and are calculated by Equation 2.44 using the data given in Table 2.1.

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values. New cₚ and γ values at exit are computed as described above and the process repeated. However, at the start of the subsequent iteration, the values for cₚ and γ are based on the average temperature change in the compression or expansion process. After each iterative step, the current values of γ, cₚ and at the exit of the compressor or turbine are compared with the values of the previous iteration. The iterative process is repeated until there is sufficient agreement between the current and previous values of cₚ and γ.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

# 2.11.1 Effect of humidity

The above analysis considers the calculation of gas properties such as cₚ and γ for dry air. However, air contains water vapour and, at high ambient temperatures, the effect of humidity can be significant and has to be accounted.

for in the calculation of the gas properties. The humidity of air is presented normally as the amount of water vapour needed to saturate the air and is referred to as the relative humidity. It is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure to the saturated water pressure and is given in Equation 2.48.

φ =  p  × 100                                                [2.48]

pₛ

where p is vapour pressure of water,

pₛ is the saturated water vapour pressure

and φ is the relative humidity as a percentage. The units for  p and  pₛ are normally in millibars.

The saturated vapour pressure,  pₛ, can be determined from:

17.67×T

p  = 6.112 ×

s           e T+ 243.5                                     [2.49]

where T is the ambient temperature in Celsius.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

ω =  massʷ                                                  [2.50]

Using Dalton’s laws of partial pressures, Equation 2.50 can be represented as:

ω = 0.622   p                                               [2.51]

P – p

where P is the ambient pressure in millibars (mb).

Given the relative humidity, ambient pressure and temperature, the mass of water vapour can be determined using the equations discussed in this section. This can be incorporated in the specific heat calculations, where the

cp humid is now given by:

cp humid = cp air × mf air + cp water × mf water             [2.52]

where

cₚ humid = specific heat at constant pressure for humid air

c  cₚ air = specific heat at constant pressure of dry air

p water = specific heat at constant pressure of water vapour

mf air = mass of dry air in 1 kg of humid air

mf water = mass of water vapour in 1 kg of humid air.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Clearly, specific humidity and relative humidity are related. This can be illustrated on the psychrometric chart shown in Fig. 2.16. For a given increase in relative humidity, there is also an increase in specific humidity. However, the increase in specific humidity and therefore the change in the mass of vapour in the air, are small at low ambient temperature, and are shown as the dry bulb temperature. It is at high ambient temperatures that the effects of humidity are noticeable in performance calculations. It should be pointed out that Fig. 2.16 is valid only for a given ambient pressure that corresponds to 1 bar. The impact of humidity on engine performance is discussed in Mathioudakis et al.7

# 2.12 Enthalpy and entropy

Although the use of mean specific heats in performance calculations gives good accuracy to within 1%, for rigorous calculations, enthalpy and entropy should be used. The specific enthalpy of a gas may be given by:

independent of pressures and temperatures that occur in gas turbines. Thus Hᴿ can be considered to be zero. Therefore Equation 2.53 reduces to:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT [2.55]

The specific heat, cp, is a polynomial in temperature T or a suitable equation such as that defined by Equation 2.44. The units for specific enthalpy are kJ/kg. Since the first and second law of thermodynamics do not permit the calculation of the absolute value enthalpy, we need a reference temperature where the enthalpy is zero (usually 273 K). However, in gas turbine performance calculations, the reference specific enthalpy is unimportant as our interest is in the change in specific enthalpy in such calculations. A similar argument holds for entropy, which will be discussed next.

The specific entropy of a gas may be given as:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0 + S[2.56]

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0[2.58]

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁).

independent of pressures and temperatures that occur in gas turbines. Thus Hᴿ can be considered to be zero. Therefore Equation 2.53 reduces to:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT [2.55]

The specific heat, cp, is a polynomial in temperature T or a suitable equation such as that defined by Equation 2.44. The units for specific enthalpy are kJ/kg. Since the first and second law of thermodynamics do not permit the calculation of the absolute value enthalpy, we need a reference temperature where the enthalpy is zero (usually 273 K). However, in gas turbine performance calculations, the reference specific enthalpy is unimportant as our interest is in the change in specific enthalpy in such calculations. A similar argument holds for entropy, which will be discussed next.

The specific entropy of a gas may be given as:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0 + S[2.56]

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0[2.58]

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

ηisen = H²′ – H¹  for compression                             [2.59]

H2  – H1

or

ηisen =  H²  – H¹  for expansion                              [2.60]

H2′ – H1

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁).

The simple cycle gas turbine performance also depends on T₃ and improves as T₃ increases. Similarly, it can be shown that the thermal efficiency of the actual or practical gas turbine increases with decrease in the minimum cycle temperature T₁. In fact, the practical gas turbine thermal efficiency is dependent on the pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

# 2.10 Effect of pressure losses on gas turbine performance

The heat addition and the heat rejection in an ideal gas turbine cycle occur at constant pressure. In a practical gas turbine the heat is supplied by burning fuel in a combustor. The combustor and the heat addition process incur pressure losses and therefore the heat addition is not a constant pressure process in a practical gas turbine cycle. Similarly, the heat sink in a practical gas turbine cycle is the atmosphere, and the ductwork to remove the exhaust gases from the gas turbine will also incur a pressure loss. Furthermore, practical gas turbines normally operate on open cycles and air is drawn in continuously to provide fresh working fluid for the gas turbine. As a result, there is also a pressure loss in the inlet system.

The combustion pressure loss varies from about 1% of the compressor discharge pressure for an industrial gas turbine to about 5% for an aero-derived gas turbine. Inlet and exhaust losses are much smaller and a typical pressure loss is about 10 mBar. Pressure losses that occur in the combustion, inlet and exhaust systems reduce the turbine work output and increase the compressor work absorbed, therefore increasing the sensitivity of the cycle performance to cycle temperatures, namely T₃/T₁. Figure 2.14 shows the temperature–entropy diagram of a practical gas turbine cycle including combustor inlet and exhaust system losses.

# 2.11 Variation of specific heats

In the ideal gas turbine cycle we have assumed that the specific heat, cₚ, and the isentropic index, γ, which is the ratio of specific heats (cₚ/cv), are constant during the various thermodynamic processes. In practice, however, the specific heats vary during compression, heat addition and expansion. In open cycle gas turbines, air is the working fluid and, at the normal operating pressures and temperatures that occur in a gas turbine cycle, the specific heat is only a function of temperature (i.e. air acts as a perfect gas).

Furthermore, the burning of fuel changes the composition of the air to products of combustion, hence this change is another factor affecting the specific heat and the isentropic index. The specific heats for air and products of combustion may be expressed as a polynomial in temperature or as an

Equation as a function of temperature, as shown by Equation 2.44. The ratios of specific heats, γ, may then be calculated from Equation 2.45. Further discussion on thermo-physical properties of air and products of combustion applicable to gas turbines are discussed in Walsh and Fletcher.4

c = T (T)–2 [2.44]

where

- T is temperature in K
- a, b and c are constants for a given gas; their values are given in Table 2.1. They have been taken from Harman.5

temperature, we calculate the specific heat cₚ for each component of air from Equation 2.44 using the corresponding constants a, b and c given above. The specific heat, cₚ, of air for a given temperature is then computed by:

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

where cₚN₂, cₚO₂, cₚAr and cₚCO₂ in Equation 2.47 are the specific heats for N₂, O₂, Ar and CO₂ at the given temperature, respectively, and are calculated by Equation 2.44 using the data given in Table 2.1.

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values. New cₚ and γ values at exit are computed as described above and the process repeated. However, at the start of the subsequent iteration, the values for cₚ and γ are based on the average temperature change in the compression or expansion process. After each iterative step, the current values of γ, cₚ and at the exit of the compressor or turbine are compared with the values of the previous iteration. The iterative process is repeated until there is sufficient agreement between the current and previous values of cₚ and γ.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

# 2.11.1 Effect of humidity

The above analysis considers the calculation of gas properties such as cₚ and γ for dry air. However, air contains water vapour and, at high ambient temperatures, the effect of humidity can be significant and has to be accounted.

# 36 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for in the calculation of the gas properties. The humidity of air is presented normally as the amount of water vapour needed to saturate the air and is referred to as the relative humidity. It is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure to the saturated water pressure and is given in Equation 2.48.

φ =  p  × 100                                                [2.48]

pₛ

where p is vapour pressure of water,

pₛ is the saturated water vapour pressure

and φ is the relative humidity as a percentage. The units for  p and  pₛ are normally in millibars.

The saturated vapour pressure,  pₛ, can be determined from:

17.67×T

p  = 6.112 ×

s           e T+ 243.5                                     [2.49]

where T is the ambient temperature in Celsius.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

ω =  massʷ                                                  [2.50]

massa

Using Dalton’s laws of partial pressures, Equation 2.50 can be represented as:

ω = 0.622   p                                               [2.51]

P – p

where P is the ambient pressure in millibars (mb).

Given the relative humidity, ambient pressure and temperature, the mass of water vapour can be determined using the equations discussed in this section. This can be incorporated in the specific heat calculations, where the

cp humid is now given by:

cp humid = cp air × mf air + cp water × mf water             [2.52]

where

cₚ humid = specific heat at constant pressure for humid air

c  cₚ air = specific heat at constant pressure of dry air

p water = specific heat at constant pressure of water vapour

mf air = mass of dry air in 1 kg of humid air

mf water = mass of water vapour in 1 kg of humid air.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Clearly, specific humidity and relative humidity are related. This can be illustrated on the psychrometric chart shown in Fig. 2.16. For a given increase in relative humidity, there is also an increase in specific humidity. However, the increase in specific humidity and therefore the change in the mass of vapour in the air, are small at low ambient temperature, and are shown as the dry bulb temperature. It is at high ambient temperatures that the effects of humidity are noticeable in performance calculations. It should be pointed out that Fig. 2.16 is valid only for a given ambient pressure that corresponds to 1 bar. The impact of humidity on engine performance is discussed in Mathioudakis et al.7

# 2.12 Enthalpy and entropy

Although the use of mean specific heats in performance calculations gives good accuracy to within 1%, for rigorous calculations, enthalpy and entropy should be used. The specific enthalpy of a gas may be given by:

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

# 2.10 Effect of pressure losses on gas turbine performance

The heat addition and the heat rejection in an ideal gas turbine cycle occur at constant pressure. In a practical gas turbine the heat is supplied by burning fuel in a combustor. The combustor and the heat addition process incur pressure losses and therefore the heat addition is not a constant pressure process in a practical gas turbine cycle. Similarly, the heat sink in a practical gas turbine cycle is the atmosphere, and the ductwork to remove the exhaust gases from the gas turbine will also incur a pressure loss. Furthermore, practical gas turbines normally operate on open cycles and air is drawn in continuously to provide fresh working fluid for the gas turbine. As a result, there is also a pressure loss in the inlet system.

The combustion pressure loss varies from about 1% of the compressor discharge pressure for an industrial gas turbine to about 5% for an aero-derived gas turbine. Inlet and exhaust losses are much smaller and a typical pressure loss is about 10 mBar. Pressure losses that occur in the combustion, inlet and exhaust systems reduce the turbine work output and increase the compressor work absorbed, therefore increasing the sensitivity of the cycle performance to cycle temperatures, namely T₃/T₁. Figure 2.14 shows the temperature–entropy diagram of a practical gas turbine cycle including combustor inlet and exhaust system losses.

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

ω =  massʷ                                                  [2.50]

Using Dalton’s laws of partial pressures, Equation 2.50 can be represented as:

ω = 0.622   p                                               [2.51]

P – p

where P is the ambient pressure in millibars (mb).

Given the relative humidity, ambient pressure and temperature, the mass of water vapour can be determined using the equations discussed in this section. This can be incorporated in the specific heat calculations, where the

cp humid is now given by:

cp humid = cp air × mf air + cp water × mf water             [2.52]

where

cₚ humid = specific heat at constant pressure for humid air

c  cₚ air = specific heat at constant pressure of dry air

p water = specific heat at constant pressure of water vapour

mf air = mass of dry air in 1 kg of humid air

mf water = mass of water vapour in 1 kg of humid air.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Clearly, specific humidity and relative humidity are related. This can be illustrated on the psychrometric chart shown in Fig. 2.16. For a given increase in relative humidity, there is also an increase in specific humidity. However, the increase in specific humidity and therefore the change in the mass of vapour in the air, are small at low ambient temperature, and are shown as the dry bulb temperature. It is at high ambient temperatures that the effects of humidity are noticeable in performance calculations. It should be pointed out that Fig. 2.16 is valid only for a given ambient pressure that corresponds to 1 bar. The impact of humidity on engine performance is discussed in Mathioudakis et al.7

# 2.12 Enthalpy and entropy

Although the use of mean specific heats in performance calculations gives good accuracy to within 1%, for rigorous calculations, enthalpy and entropy should be used. The specific enthalpy of a gas may be given by:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT + R[2.53]

where HR is the residual property and is given by:

HR = –RT2 ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP const T[2.54]

For a perfect gas, the compressibility factor, Z, is very close to unity and is

independent of pressures and temperatures that occur in gas turbines. Thus Hᴿ can be considered to be zero. Therefore Equation 2.53 reduces to:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT [2.55]

The specific heat, cp, is a polynomial in temperature T or a suitable equation such as that defined by Equation 2.44. The units for specific enthalpy are kJ/kg. Since the first and second law of thermodynamics do not permit the calculation of the absolute value enthalpy, we need a reference temperature where the enthalpy is zero (usually 273 K). However, in gas turbine performance calculations, the reference specific enthalpy is unimportant as our interest is in the change in specific enthalpy in such calculations. A similar argument holds for entropy, which will be discussed next.

The specific entropy of a gas may be given as:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0 + S[2.56]

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0[2.58]

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

ηisen = H²′ – H¹  for compression                             [2.59]

H2  – H1

or

ηisen =  H²  – H¹  for expansion                              [2.60]

H2′ – H1

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁). ",What is the significance of the psychrometric chart in gas turbine performance calculations?,"The psychrometric chart illustrates the relationship between specific humidity and relative humidity, aiding in the assessment of humidity's impact on performance.","It helps visualize how changes in relative humidity affect specific humidity, which is crucial for understanding humidity's role in gas turbine efficiency.","The chart is a valuable tool for analyzing the effects of air humidity on gas turbine performance, especially at high ambient temperatures.","By showing the link between specific and relative humidity, the psychrometric chart assists in evaluating humidity's influence on turbine operations.","The psychrometric chart is essential for gauging how humidity variations can alter gas turbine performance, particularly under varying temperature conditions."

The simple cycle gas turbine performance also depends on T₃ and improves as T₃ increases. Similarly, it can be shown that the thermal efficiency of the actual or practical gas turbine increases with decrease in the minimum cycle temperature T₁. In fact, the practical gas turbine thermal efficiency is dependent on the pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

# 2.10 Effect of pressure losses on gas turbine performance

The heat addition and the heat rejection in an ideal gas turbine cycle occur at constant pressure. In a practical gas turbine the heat is supplied by burning fuel in a combustor. The combustor and the heat addition process incur pressure losses and therefore the heat addition is not a constant pressure process in a practical gas turbine cycle. Similarly, the heat sink in a practical gas turbine cycle is the atmosphere, and the ductwork to remove the exhaust gases from the gas turbine will also incur a pressure loss. Furthermore, practical gas turbines normally operate on open cycles and air is drawn in continuously to provide fresh working fluid for the gas turbine. As a result, there is also a pressure loss in the inlet system.

The combustion pressure loss varies from about 1% of the compressor discharge pressure for an industrial gas turbine to about 5% for an aero-derived gas turbine. Inlet and exhaust losses are much smaller and a typical pressure loss is about 10 mBar. Pressure losses that occur in the combustion, inlet and exhaust systems reduce the turbine work output and increase the compressor work absorbed, therefore increasing the sensitivity of the cycle performance to cycle temperatures, namely T₃/T₁. Figure 2.14 shows the temperature–entropy diagram of a practical gas turbine cycle including combustor inlet and exhaust system losses.

# 2.11 Variation of specific heats

In the ideal gas turbine cycle we have assumed that the specific heat, cₚ, and the isentropic index, γ, which is the ratio of specific heats (cₚ/cv), are constant during the various thermodynamic processes. In practice, however, the specific heats vary during compression, heat addition and expansion. In open cycle gas turbines, air is the working fluid and, at the normal operating pressures and temperatures that occur in a gas turbine cycle, the specific heat is only a function of temperature (i.e. air acts as a perfect gas).

Furthermore, the burning of fuel changes the composition of the air to products of combustion, hence this change is another factor affecting the specific heat and the isentropic index. The specific heats for air and products of combustion may be expressed as a polynomial in temperature or as an

c = T (T)–2 [2.44]

- T is temperature in K
- a, b and c are constants for a given gas; their values are given in Table 2.1. They have been taken from Harman.5

temperature, we calculate the specific heat cₚ for each component of air from Equation 2.44 using the corresponding constants a, b and c given above. The specific heat, cₚ, of air for a given temperature is then computed by:

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

where cₚN₂, cₚO₂, cₚAr and cₚCO₂ in Equation 2.47 are the specific heats for N₂, O₂, Ar and CO₂ at the given temperature, respectively, and are calculated by Equation 2.44 using the data given in Table 2.1.

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values. New cₚ and γ values at exit are computed as described above and the process repeated. However, at the start of the subsequent iteration, the values for cₚ and γ are based on the average temperature change in the compression or expansion process. After each iterative step, the current values of γ, cₚ and at the exit of the compressor or turbine are compared with the values of the previous iteration. The iterative process is repeated until there is sufficient agreement between the current and previous values of cₚ and γ.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

# 2.11.1 Effect of humidity

The above analysis considers the calculation of gas properties such as cₚ and γ for dry air. However, air contains water vapour and, at high ambient temperatures, the effect of humidity can be significant and has to be accounted.

# 36 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for in the calculation of the gas properties. The humidity of air is presented normally as the amount of water vapour needed to saturate the air and is referred to as the relative humidity. It is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure to the saturated water pressure and is given in Equation 2.48.

φ =  p  × 100                                                [2.48]

where T is the ambient temperature in Celsius.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

# 2.11.1 Effect of humidity

The above analysis considers the calculation of gas properties such as cₚ and γ for dry air. However, air contains water vapour and, at high ambient temperatures, the effect of humidity can be significant and has to be accounted.

for in the calculation of the gas properties. The humidity of air is presented normally as the amount of water vapour needed to saturate the air and is referred to as the relative humidity. It is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure to the saturated water pressure and is given in Equation 2.48.

φ =  p  × 100                                                [2.48]

pₛ

where p is vapour pressure of water,

pₛ is the saturated water vapour pressure

and φ is the relative humidity as a percentage. The units for  p and  pₛ are normally in millibars.

The saturated vapour pressure,  pₛ, can be determined from:

17.67×T

p  = 6.112 ×

s           e T+ 243.5                                     [2.49]

where T is the ambient temperature in Celsius.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

ω =  massʷ                                                  [2.50]

Using Dalton’s laws of partial pressures, Equation 2.50 can be represented as:

ω = 0.622   p                                               [2.51]

P – p

where P is the ambient pressure in millibars (mb).

Given the relative humidity, ambient pressure and temperature, the mass of water vapour can be determined using the equations discussed in this section. This can be incorporated in the specific heat calculations, where the

cp humid is now given by:

cp humid = cp air × mf air + cp water × mf water             [2.52]

where

cₚ humid = specific heat at constant pressure for humid air

c  cₚ air = specific heat at constant pressure of dry air

p water = specific heat at constant pressure of water vapour

mf air = mass of dry air in 1 kg of humid air

mf water = mass of water vapour in 1 kg of humid air.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Clearly, specific humidity and relative humidity are related. This can be illustrated on the psychrometric chart shown in Fig. 2.16. For a given increase in relative humidity, there is also an increase in specific humidity. However, the increase in specific humidity and therefore the change in the mass of vapour in the air, are small at low ambient temperature, and are shown as the dry bulb temperature. It is at high ambient temperatures that the effects of humidity are noticeable in performance calculations. It should be pointed out that Fig. 2.16 is valid only for a given ambient pressure that corresponds to 1 bar. The impact of humidity on engine performance is discussed in Mathioudakis et al.7

# 2.12 Enthalpy and entropy

Although the use of mean specific heats in performance calculations gives good accuracy to within 1%, for rigorous calculations, enthalpy and entropy should be used. The specific enthalpy of a gas may be given by:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT + R[2.53]

where HR is the residual property and is given by:

HR = –RT2 ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP const T[2.54]

For a perfect gas, the compressibility factor, Z, is very close to unity and is

independent of pressures and temperatures that occur in gas turbines. Thus Hᴿ can be considered to be zero. Therefore Equation 2.53 reduces to:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT [2.55]

The specific heat, cp, is a polynomial in temperature T or a suitable equation such as that defined by Equation 2.44. The units for specific enthalpy are kJ/kg. Since the first and second law of thermodynamics do not permit the calculation of the absolute value enthalpy, we need a reference temperature where the enthalpy is zero (usually 273 K). However, in gas turbine performance calculations, the reference specific enthalpy is unimportant as our interest is in the change in specific enthalpy in such calculations. A similar argument holds for entropy, which will be discussed next.

The specific entropy of a gas may be given as:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0 + S[2.56]

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0[2.58]

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

ηisen = H²′ – H¹  for compression                             [2.59]

H2  – H1

or

ηisen =  H²  – H¹  for expansion                              [2.60]

H2′ – H1

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁).

The simple cycle gas turbine performance also depends on T₃ and improves as T₃ increases. Similarly, it can be shown that the thermal efficiency of the actual or practical gas turbine increases with decrease in the minimum cycle temperature T₁. In fact, the practical gas turbine thermal efficiency is dependent on the pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

# 2.10 Effect of pressure losses on gas turbine performance

The heat addition and the heat rejection in an ideal gas turbine cycle occur at constant pressure. In a practical gas turbine the heat is supplied by burning fuel in a combustor. The combustor and the heat addition process incur pressure losses and therefore the heat addition is not a constant pressure process in a practical gas turbine cycle. Similarly, the heat sink in a practical gas turbine cycle is the atmosphere, and the ductwork to remove the exhaust gases from the gas turbine will also incur a pressure loss. Furthermore, practical gas turbines normally operate on open cycles and air is drawn in continuously to provide fresh working fluid for the gas turbine. As a result, there is also a pressure loss in the inlet system.

The combustion pressure loss varies from about 1% of the compressor discharge pressure for an industrial gas turbine to about 5% for an aero-derived gas turbine. Inlet and exhaust losses are much smaller and a typical pressure loss is about 10 mBar. Pressure losses that occur in the combustion, inlet and exhaust systems reduce the turbine work output and increase the compressor work absorbed, therefore increasing the sensitivity of the cycle performance to cycle temperatures, namely T₃/T₁. Figure 2.14 shows the temperature–entropy diagram of a practical gas turbine cycle including combustor inlet and exhaust system losses.

# 2.11 Variation of specific heats

In the ideal gas turbine cycle we have assumed that the specific heat, cₚ, and the isentropic index, γ, which is the ratio of specific heats (cₚ/cv), are constant during the various thermodynamic processes. In practice, however, the specific heats vary during compression, heat addition and expansion. In open cycle gas turbines, air is the working fluid and, at the normal operating pressures and temperatures that occur in a gas turbine cycle, the specific heat is only a function of temperature (i.e. air acts as a perfect gas).

Furthermore, the burning of fuel changes the composition of the air to products of combustion, hence this change is another factor affecting the specific heat and the isentropic index. The specific heats for air and products of combustion may be expressed as a polynomial in temperature or as an

Equation as a function of temperature, as shown by Equation 2.44. The ratios of specific heats, γ, may then be calculated from Equation 2.45. Further discussion on thermo-physical properties of air and products of combustion applicable to gas turbines are discussed in Walsh and Fletcher.4

c = T (T)–2 [2.44]

where

- T is temperature in K
- a, b and c are constants for a given gas; their values are given in Table 2.1. They have been taken from Harman.5

temperature, we calculate the specific heat cₚ for each component of air from Equation 2.44 using the corresponding constants a, b and c given above. The specific heat, cₚ, of air for a given temperature is then computed by:

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

where cₚN₂, cₚO₂, cₚAr and cₚCO₂ in Equation 2.47 are the specific heats for N₂, O₂, Ar and CO₂ at the given temperature, respectively, and are calculated by Equation 2.44 using the data given in Table 2.1.

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values. New cₚ and γ values at exit are computed as described above and the process repeated. However, at the start of the subsequent iteration, the values for cₚ and γ are based on the average temperature change in the compression or expansion process. After each iterative step, the current values of γ, cₚ and at the exit of the compressor or turbine are compared with the values of the previous iteration. The iterative process is repeated until there is sufficient agreement between the current and previous values of cₚ and γ.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

temperature, we calculate the specific heat cₚ for each component of air from Equation 2.44 using the corresponding constants a, b and c given above. The specific heat, cₚ, of air for a given temperature is then computed by:

cp air = 0.7553 × cₚN₂ + 0.2314 × cₚO₂ + 0.0128 × cₚAr + 0.0005 × cpCO₂ [2.47]

where cₚN₂, cₚO₂, cₚAr and cₚCO₂ in Equation 2.47 are the specific heats for N₂, O₂, Ar and CO₂ at the given temperature, respectively, and are calculated by Equation 2.44 using the data given in Table 2.1.

When the changes in specific heat are considered in the calculation of compressor and turbine exit temperatures, the process is implicit or iterative. The iterative process begins with computation of the exit temperatures for the compression and expansion process by assuming the exit values for cₚ and γ for air or products of combustions are equal to the inlet values. New cₚ and γ values at exit are computed as described above and the process repeated. However, at the start of the subsequent iteration, the values for cₚ and γ are based on the average temperature change in the compression or expansion process. After each iterative step, the current values of γ, cₚ and at the exit of the compressor or turbine are compared with the values of the previous iteration. The iterative process is repeated until there is sufficient agreement between the current and previous values of cₚ and γ.

The flow chart described in Fig. 2.15 summarises the above iterative process in calculating the compressor or turbine exit temperatures for a given inlet pressure, temperature and fuel–air ratio, taking into account the variation of cₚ and γ.

# 2.11.1 Effect of humidity

The above analysis considers the calculation of gas properties such as cₚ and γ for dry air. However, air contains water vapour and, at high ambient temperatures, the effect of humidity can be significant and has to be accounted.

for in the calculation of the gas properties. The humidity of air is presented normally as the amount of water vapour needed to saturate the air and is referred to as the relative humidity. It is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure to the saturated water pressure and is given in Equation 2.48.

φ =  p  × 100                                                [2.48]

pₛ

where p is vapour pressure of water,

pₛ is the saturated water vapour pressure

and φ is the relative humidity as a percentage. The units for  p and  pₛ are normally in millibars.

The saturated vapour pressure,  pₛ, can be determined from:

17.67×T

p  = 6.112 ×

s           e T+ 243.5                                     [2.49]

where T is the ambient temperature in Celsius.

Thus, given the ambient temperature and relative humidity, the vapour pressure of water vapour can be determined from Equation 2.48.

For gas turbine performance calculations, we need to know the amount of water vapour on a mass basis. This can now be determined using the definition of specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapour present in a unit mass of dry air and is given by Equation 2.50.

ω =  massʷ                                                  [2.50]

Using Dalton’s laws of partial pressures, Equation 2.50 can be represented as:

ω = 0.622   p                                               [2.51]

P – p

where P is the ambient pressure in millibars (mb).

Given the relative humidity, ambient pressure and temperature, the mass of water vapour can be determined using the equations discussed in this section. This can be incorporated in the specific heat calculations, where the

cp humid is now given by:

cp humid = cp air × mf air + cp water × mf water             [2.52]

where

cₚ humid = specific heat at constant pressure for humid air

c  cₚ air = specific heat at constant pressure of dry air

p water = specific heat at constant pressure of water vapour

mf air = mass of dry air in 1 kg of humid air

mf water = mass of water vapour in 1 kg of humid air.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Clearly, specific humidity and relative humidity are related. This can be illustrated on the psychrometric chart shown in Fig. 2.16. For a given increase in relative humidity, there is also an increase in specific humidity. However, the increase in specific humidity and therefore the change in the mass of vapour in the air, are small at low ambient temperature, and are shown as the dry bulb temperature. It is at high ambient temperatures that the effects of humidity are noticeable in performance calculations. It should be pointed out that Fig. 2.16 is valid only for a given ambient pressure that corresponds to 1 bar. The impact of humidity on engine performance is discussed in Mathioudakis et al.7

# 2.12 Enthalpy and entropy

Although the use of mean specific heats in performance calculations gives good accuracy to within 1%, for rigorous calculations, enthalpy and entropy should be used. The specific enthalpy of a gas may be given by:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT + R[2.53]

where HR is the residual property and is given by:

HR = –RT2 ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP const T[2.54]

For a perfect gas, the compressibility factor, Z, is very close to unity and is

independent of pressures and temperatures that occur in gas turbines. Thus Hᴿ can be considered to be zero. Therefore Equation 2.53 reduces to:

H = H0 + ∫ cp dT [2.55]

The specific heat, cp, is a polynomial in temperature T or a suitable equation such as that defined by Equation 2.44. The units for specific enthalpy are kJ/kg. Since the first and second law of thermodynamics do not permit the calculation of the absolute value enthalpy, we need a reference temperature where the enthalpy is zero (usually 273 K). However, in gas turbine performance calculations, the reference specific enthalpy is unimportant as our interest is in the change in specific enthalpy in such calculations. A similar argument holds for entropy, which will be discussed next.

The specific entropy of a gas may be given as:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0 + S[2.56]

where SR is the residual property and given by:

SR = –RT ∫ ⌈ ∂Z ⌉ dP – ∫ (Z – 1) dP const T[2.57]

Again, for a perfect gas, we can neglect the residual term and Equation 2.56 reduces to:

S = S0 + ∫ cp dT – ln PR P0[2.58]

The reference temperature and pressure, when the entropy is zero, is usually 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively. The units for entropy are kJ/kg K.

The evaluation of the residual terms for enthalpy and entropy requires an equation of state and these issues are discussed in detail in Smith et al.8 As stated above, the temperature and pressure ranges that occur in gas turbines are such that these residual terms are very small and can be neglected (i.e. air and products of combustion behave as a perfect gas for this temperature and pressure range).

Given a pressure ratio, inlet temperature T1 and pressure P1, the calculation of discharge temperatures for a compression or expansion process is as follows. The inlet specific entropy, S1, is evaluated using Equation 2.58. Using the discharge pressure for the compression or expansion process, the temperature discharge temperature T2′ from Equation 2.58 will be calculated such that the specific entropy at the end of the compression or expansion process is equal to S1 (i.e. isentropic compression or expansion). Using Equation 2.55, the ideal specific enthalpy, H2′, is calculated at the compressor or turbine discharge. From Equation 2.55 the specific enthalpy

at the inlet,  H₁, is also calculated The isentropic efficiency equation using specific enthalpies is:

ηisen = H²′ – H¹  for compression                             [2.59]

H2  – H1

or

ηisen =  H²  – H¹  for expansion                              [2.60]

H2′ – H1

Given an isentropic efficiency, the actual discharge specific enthalpy, H₂, is calculated for a compression or expansion process. Knowing 2.55, the discharge temperature, T H₂ from Equation 2, is calculated. The specific work, which is the work done per unit mass flow rate of air/gas, for the expansion or compression process, is simply the difference between these enthalpies (i.e. H₂ –  H₁). ",What is the process for calculating compressor or turbine exit temperatures when specific heats vary?,"An iterative process is used, starting with initial estimates of cₚ and γ, then refining these values based on average temperatures until convergence is achieved.","The calculation involves iterative steps to adjust cₚ and γ values based on temperature changes, ensuring accurate exit temperature predictions.","To account for varying specific heats, an iterative method is employed, updating cₚ and γ with each step until the values stabilize.","Exit temperatures are determined through iteration, progressively refining cₚ and γ estimates to reflect the actual temperature-dependent properties.",This iterative approach ensures that the varying nature of specific heats is accurately incorporated into the calculation of compressor or turbine exit temperatures.
