Thus, low ambient pressures are beneficial when the power demand from the gas turbine does not subject it to an engine operating limit. A similar conclusion was drawn when the ambient pressure transient was considered using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator (Section 12.2). The principle of the closed cycle gas turbine was also discussed, where the system pressure is varied to reduce the power output of the gas turbine while maintaining the thermal efficiency. Closed cycle gas turbines are equally applicable to single-shaft gas turbines and were first implemented using such an engine configuration.

Figure 17.10 also shows the trends in the gas turbine and generator power.

These remain constant because the engine is not subjected to an operating constraint. ",What does the text suggest about the applicability of closed cycle gas turbines?,"The text suggests that closed cycle gas turbines are applicable to both single-shaft and two-shaft configurations, having been first implemented with single-shaft engines.","Closed cycle gas turbines are versatile, applicable to single-shaft and other configurations, with their initial implementation on single-shaft engines, as noted in the text.","According to the text, closed cycle gas turbines can be used with single-shaft gas turbines, among others, and were originally deployed in such setups.","The text indicates that closed cycle gas turbines are suitable for single-shaft gas turbines, highlighting their first use in this engine configuration.","The applicability of closed cycle gas turbines extends to single-shaft engines, where they were first applied, as mentioned in the text."
