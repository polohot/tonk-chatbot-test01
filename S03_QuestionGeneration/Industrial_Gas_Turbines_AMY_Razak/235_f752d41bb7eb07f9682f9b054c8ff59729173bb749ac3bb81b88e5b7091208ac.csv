For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the condensation flow rates can be as much as 50 tonnes per day. Thus, means to remove this water must be provided when chillers are employed. The cooling loads and power demand for chillers using vapour compression systems are shown in Fig. 14.24. Note that the cooling loads and power demand increase exponentially when condensation occurs. This is primarily due to the absorption of the latent heat of evaporation for water by the chillers.
