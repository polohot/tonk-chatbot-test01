For a given equivalence ratio and airflow rate, the fuel flow can be determined by:

Clearly, the heat release rate is proportional to the combustion airflow rate and the airflow rate represented on the x-axis in Fig. 6.20 could be replaced with the heat release rate when comparing fuel atomisation techniques. The higher the heat release rate, the smaller will be the combustion volume required. The method employed to atomise the fuel also has an impact on the combustion stability curve. Figure 6.21 shows the stability curves for an air blast atomiser and a pressure swirl atomiser, respectively. The atomisation of the fuel using an air blast atomiser is much greater than that achieved by the pressure swirl atomiser. Consequently, the heat release rate using an air blast atomiser is greater but the stability loop is much narrower compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. This is due to a more homogeneous mixture with air blast atomisers compared with the pressure swirl atomisers, which produce a larger variation of fuel–air ratios, thus resulting in a wider stability loop. More details on all aspects of turbine combustion may be found in Lefebvre.³

# 6.7 Combustion pressure loss and efficiency

Components of the combustor resist the flow of air, resulting in a pressure loss. The high level of turbulence necessary for combustion also extracts energy from the air entering the combustor. Both these factors result in a loss in (stagnation) pressure in the combustor. This pressure loss is called the cold loss and is proportional to the combustor inlet dynamic pressure 1/2 ρu². There is another source of pressure loss and that is associated with the addition of heat. The addition of heat results in a reduction of density, which in turn increases the velocity and this is known as Rayleigh flow.

Pressure loss is necessary to increase the velocity (momentum) and is called the hot or fundamental loss.

The non-dimensional pressure loss can be expressed as:

ΔP 1₂ = PLF ×
⌈ W1 R T / γ ⌉2

P1 =
⌊ 1  1  1 ⌋ × γ                          [6.11]

- ΔP1₂ is the combustor stagnation pressure drop
- P1 is the combustor inlet pressure
- T1 is the combustor inlet temperature
- PLF is the combustor pressure loss factor
- R1 is the gas constant
- γ is the isentropic index (cp/cv), where cp and cv are the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively.

The pressure loss factor is given by:

PLF = K1 + K2 (T2/T1 – 1)                                       [6.12]

where K1 and K2 are constants for a given combustor, T2 is the combustor exit temperature and T2/T1 is the ratio of the stagnation temperature rise across the combustor. The variation of the pressure loss factor with T2/T1 is shown in Fig. 6.22. Combustion pressure loss varies from about 2% for an industrial combustor to about 6% for an aero-derivative combustor.

The combustion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual heat released to that of maximum heat released due to the combustion. This translates to the theoretical fuel–air ratio for a given combustion temperature rise to that

where F/A is the fuel–air ratio and ΔT is the overall combustor temperature rise required.

# 6.8 Formation of pollutants

The combustion process described previously occurs because of the formation of radicals and species such as CO and hydrocarbon radicals (H–C). The intermediate zone of the combustor normally reduces these radicals by addition of more air and by forcing the chemical reaction towards the production of carbon dioxide and water.

The combustion efficiency is very high, typically 98.5% to 99.5%, but the 0.5% to 1.5% loss in combustion efficiency results in the presence of CO and H–C in the exhaust gases, usually referred to as unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). Conditions that promote the formation of UHCs also promote CO and both these compounds are toxic. Unlike CO, which is a colourless, odourless gas, UHCs have the characteristic smell usually found in airport environments.

Another pollutant formed during combustion is due to the oxidation of nitrogen found in the combustion air.

# 6.8 Formation of pollutants

The combustion process described previously occurs because of the formation of radicals and species such as CO and hydrocarbon radicals (H–C). The intermediate zone of the combustor normally reduces these radicals by addition of more air and by forcing the chemical reaction towards the production of carbon dioxide and water.

The combustion efficiency is very high, typically 98.5% to 99.5%, but the 0.5% to 1.5% loss in combustion efficiency results in the presence of CO and H–C in the exhaust gases, usually referred to as unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). Conditions that promote the formation of UHCs also promote CO and both these compounds are toxic. Unlike CO, which is a colourless, odourless gas, UHCs have the characteristic smell usually found in airport environments.

Another pollutant formed during combustion is due to the oxidation of nitrogen found in the combustion air. ",What are the sources of pressure loss in a combustor?,"Pressure loss in a combustor arises from cold loss, due to air flow resistance and turbulence, and hot loss, from heat addition increasing velocity.",Combustor pressure loss comes from cold loss (flow resistance and turbulence) and hot loss (heat addition effects).,"Two main sources of pressure loss exist: cold loss from airflow resistance and turbulence, and hot loss from heat-induced velocity increase.",Pressure loss is caused by cold factors like flow resistance and hot factors such as heat addition raising velocity.,"In combustors, pressure loss stems from both cold (resistance and turbulence) and hot (heat addition) sources."

For a given equivalence ratio and airflow rate, the fuel flow can be determined by:

Clearly, the heat release rate is proportional to the combustion airflow rate and the airflow rate represented on the x-axis in Fig. 6.20 could be replaced with the heat release rate when comparing fuel atomisation techniques. The higher the heat release rate, the smaller will be the combustion volume required. The method employed to atomise the fuel also has an impact on the combustion stability curve. Figure 6.21 shows the stability curves for an air blast atomiser and a pressure swirl atomiser, respectively. The atomisation of the fuel using an air blast atomiser is much greater than that achieved by the pressure swirl atomiser. Consequently, the heat release rate using an air blast atomiser is greater but the stability loop is much narrower compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. This is due to a more homogeneous mixture with air blast atomisers compared with the pressure swirl atomisers, which produce a larger variation of fuel–air ratios, thus resulting in a wider stability loop.

# 6.7 Combustion pressure loss and efficiency

Components of the combustor resist the flow of air, resulting in a pressure loss. The high level of turbulence necessary for combustion also extracts energy from the air entering the combustor. Both these factors result in a loss in (stagnation) pressure in the combustor. This pressure loss is called the cold loss and is proportional to the combustor inlet dynamic pressure 1/2 ρu². There is another source of pressure loss and that is associated with the addition of heat. The addition of heat results in a reduction of density, which in turn increases the velocity and this is known as Rayleigh flow.

",What is the typical range of combustion efficiency in industrial and aero-derivative combustors?,"Combustion efficiency typically ranges from 98.5% to 99.5%, with losses leading to pollutants like CO and UHC.","Efficiency is usually between 98.5% and 99.5%, with the small percentage loss accounting for pollutant formation.","The efficiency range is 98.5%-99.5%, where the minor inefficiency results in CO and UHC emissions.","Most combustors achieve 98.5% to 99.5% efficiency, with the remainder contributing to harmful emissions.","With efficiencies of 98.5%-99.5%, the slight inefficiency in combustion leads to the production of pollutants."

For a given equivalence ratio and airflow rate, the fuel flow can be determined by:

mf = ma Φ (FAR)ₛ                                                [6.9]

where

- mf = fuel flow rate
- ma = combustion airflow rate
- Φ = equivalence ratio
- (FAR)ₛ = stoichiometric fuel–air ratio.

And the heat release rate, HRR, is given by

HRR = mf × Qₙₑₜ

then,

HRR = ma × Φ × (FAR)ₛ × Qₙₑₜ                                   [6.10]

where Qₙₑₜ is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

Clearly, the heat release rate is proportional to the combustion airflow rate and the airflow rate represented on the x-axis in Fig. 6.20 could be replaced with the heat release rate when comparing fuel atomisation techniques. The higher the heat release rate, the smaller will be the combustion volume required. The method employed to atomise the fuel also has an impact on the combustion stability curve. Figure 6.21 shows the stability curves for an air blast atomiser and a pressure swirl atomiser, respectively. The atomisation of the fuel using an air blast atomiser is much greater than that achieved by the pressure swirl atomiser. Consequently, the heat release rate using an air blast atomiser is greater but the stability loop is much narrower compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. This is due to a more homogeneous mixture with air blast atomisers compared with the pressure swirl atomisers, which produce a larger variation of fuel–air ratios, thus resulting in a wider stability loop. More details on all aspects of turbine combustion may be found in Lefebvre.³

# 6.7 Combustion pressure loss and efficiency

Components of the combustor resist the flow of air, resulting in a pressure loss. The high level of turbulence necessary for combustion also extracts energy from the air entering the combustor. Both these factors result in a loss in (stagnation) pressure in the combustor. This pressure loss is called the cold loss and is proportional to the combustor inlet dynamic pressure 1/2 ρu². There is another source of pressure loss and that is associated with the addition of heat. The addition of heat results in a reduction of density, which in turn increases the velocity and this is known as Rayleigh flow.

Pressure loss is necessary to increase the velocity (momentum) and is called the hot or fundamental loss.

The non-dimensional pressure loss can be expressed as:

ΔP 1₂ = PLF ×
⌈ W1 R T / γ ⌉2

P1 =
⌊ 1  1  1 ⌋ × γ                          [6.11]

where

- ΔP1₂ is the combustor stagnation pressure drop
- P1 is the combustor inlet pressure
- T1 is the combustor inlet temperature
- PLF is the combustor pressure loss factor
- R1 is the gas constant
- γ is the isentropic index (cp/cv), where cp and cv are the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively.

The pressure loss factor is given by:

PLF = K1 + K2 (T2/T1 – 1)                                       [6.12]

where K1 and K2 are constants for a given combustor, T2 is the combustor exit temperature and T2/T1 is the ratio of the stagnation temperature rise across the combustor. The variation of the pressure loss factor with T2/T1 is shown in Fig. 6.22. Combustion pressure loss varies from about 2% for an industrial combustor to about 6% for an aero-derivative combustor.

The combustion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual heat released to that of maximum heat released due to the combustion. This translates to the theoretical fuel–air ratio for a given combustion temperature rise to that

of the actual fuel–air ratio for the same temperature rise. The values for the theoretical fuel–air ratio can be obtained from Fig. 2.17, Chapter 2. Therefore, the combustion efficiency  ηb is given by:

ηb = (theoretical ( F/A) for a given  ΔT)/(actual (F/A) for a given ΔT)                                              [6.13]

where F/A is the fuel–air ratio and ΔT is the overall combustor temperature rise required.

# 6.8 Formation of pollutants

The combustion process described previously occurs because of the formation of radicals and species such as CO and hydrocarbon radicals (H–C). The intermediate zone of the combustor normally reduces these radicals by addition of more air and by forcing the chemical reaction towards the production of carbon dioxide and water.

The combustion efficiency is very high, typically 98.5% to 99.5%, but the 0.5% to 1.5% loss in combustion efficiency results in the presence of CO and H–C in the exhaust gases, usually referred to as unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). Conditions that promote the formation of UHCs also promote CO and both these compounds are toxic. Unlike CO, which is a colourless, odourless gas, UHCs have the characteristic smell usually found in airport environments.

Another pollutant formed during combustion is due to the oxidation of nitrogen found in the combustion air. ",How does the pressure loss factor vary with the temperature ratio across the combustor?,"The pressure loss factor varies with the temperature ratio T2/T1, as shown in Fig. 6.22, increasing with higher temperature ratios.","It changes in relation to T2/T1, depicted in Fig. 6.22, where higher ratios lead to greater pressure loss factors.","Variation is tied to the temperature ratio T2/T1, illustrated in Fig. 6.22, indicating a rise with increasing ratios.","As Fig. 6.22 shows, the pressure loss factor grows with the temperature ratio T2/T1 across the combustor.",Figure 6.22 demonstrates how the pressure loss factor escalates as the temperature ratio T2/T1 increases.
