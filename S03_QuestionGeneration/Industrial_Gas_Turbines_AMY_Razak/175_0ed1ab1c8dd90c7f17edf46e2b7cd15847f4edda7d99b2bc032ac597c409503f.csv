Δh = cT ⌈ pr γ–1 ⌉ η

⌊ γ – 1 / p1 ⎜ ⌋ c ,

which will yield the compressor stage pressure ratio. cp is the specific heat at constant pressure, γ is the isentropic index, T1 is the stage inlet temperature and ηc is the stage isentropic efficiency. Note that pressures and temperatures are now assumed to be stagnation or total values.

The Fnₑₜ term is defined as the pressure change (rise) across the compressor stage and is therefore given by:

Fnₑₜ = P2 – P1

in terms of the stage pressure ratio:

Fnₑₜ = P1(pr – 1)                                              [10.29]

Since the compression process is assumed to be adiabatic, the Enₑₜ term is equal to the rise in enthalpy, Δh × W1, where W1 is the inlet compressor flow rate.

# Engine control systems and transient performance

# Transition ducts and combustors

The forcing term, *Fnet, for transition ducts and combustors can be determined by Equation 7.6 in Chapter 7. This equation gives the non-dimensional pressure loss across the combustor. For transition ducts, the temperature rise is zero. Therefore, the Fnet* term is simply the pressure loss across the transition duct or combustor.

The energy term, *Enet, is zero for transition ducts because a thermodynamic process in such components is considered as adiabatic with no work transfer. However, for combustors the *Enet* term is calculated by the instantaneous flow, mf, times the lower heating value of the fuel, LHV*. The work transfer for combustors is zero. Thus for combustors:

*Enet = mf × LHV* [10.30]

Gas turbines often employ bleeds to prevent surge at starting conditions or when operating at low powers. This was discussed in Chapter 4.
