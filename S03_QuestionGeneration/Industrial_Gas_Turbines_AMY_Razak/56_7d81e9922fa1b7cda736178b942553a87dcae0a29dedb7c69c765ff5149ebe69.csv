Combined cycle gas turbines using a dual pressure system can achieve thermal efficiencies exceeding 55%. Triple pressure combined cycle gas turbines using a reheat gas turbine to increase the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature are being actively proposed. It is claimed that such systems are capable of achieving a thermal efficiency in the order of 60%. The pinch points and the terminal temperature difference should be about 20 °C for a boiler of economic size. The gas exit temperature should be above 120 °C to prevent corrosion.

# Co-generation systems

Industries often require both power and heating loads. In these instances, the exhaust heat from the gas turbine may be used to provide the necessary heating load. Such systems are referred to as co-generation or combined heat and power. The steam generated by the boiler is now used for heating purposes rather than producing power. An overall efficiency of 90% is possible with co-generation systems, but the major problem is low efficiencies when heating.

# 3.7 Hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine system

The employment of heat engines such as gas turbines in the production of electricity involves the gas turbine producing mechanical power, which is then converted to electrical energy by a generator. A fuel cell, on the other hand, directly converts chemical energy such as hydrogen in the presence of oxygen into electrical energy by an electrochemical reaction. As a result, the efficiency of conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy is not constrained by the Carnot efficiency. Thus, in theory, all the chemical energy can be converted into electrical energy, so achieving an equivalent thermal efficiency of 100%. In practice, however, about 80% of the energy can be converted directly into electricity. The electricity produced by fuel cells is direct current (DC) which is converted to alternating current by the use of an inverter.

Although fuel cells can use oxygen from the air, the lack of abundant hydrogen requires this element to be produced from hydrocarbons such as natural gas. This process is referred to as ‘reforming’ where steam reacts with the hydrocarbon to produce hydrogen, and carbon monoxide, which is oxidised to carbon dioxide. Thus a significant amount of energy from the fuel is lost and the overall efficiency of the fuel cells decreases to about 40%. Currently, fuel cells manufactured using solid-state material are being considered, which also carry out the reforming process but need to operate at high temperatures, typically at about 1000 degrees Celsius. The energy conversion efficiency of these fuel cells, known as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), is only about 50%. Nonetheless, this represents an impressive thermal efficiency. Another type of fuel cell that has been considered for use with hydrocarbon fuels and air is the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC).

The exhaust heat from such fuel cells, still at a high temperature, may be used to generate electricity via a heat engine. By combining such fuel cells with a gas turbine, practical thermal efficiencies approaching 70% can be achieved.⁵ A schematic representation of a hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine system is shown in Fig. 3.38. The high pressure compressor discharge air is

# Complex gas turbine cycle

# 3.38 Schematic representation of a hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine system.

Heated in the heat exchanger using the turbine exhaust gases. The heated compressor discharge air enters the fuel cell, where fuel is added and electricity is produced. The high temperature gases leaving the fuel cell enter the turbine, which produces power to drive the compressor and the electrical generator. An oxidiser is provided to ensure combustion is complete. Such a hybrid system is referred to as a ‘direct fired turbine’ system.

Hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine systems are currently under development and no doubt they will appear in the future. They may first find application in distributed power generation, where power is generated close to the user’s site as opposed to centralised power generation, where power is transmitted to users over long distances. Fuel cells may also be used in co-generation systems, where both power and heat/cooling loads are needed by the user.

It must be pointed out that complex gas turbine cycles may also compete for distributed power generation, but will probably include a fuel cell when fully developed. Such complex cycles used in conjunction with fuel cells may be capable of practical thermal efficiencies in excess of 70%.

Heated in the heat exchanger using the turbine exhaust gases. The heated compressor discharge air enters the fuel cell, where fuel is added and electricity is produced. The high temperature gases leaving the fuel cell enter the turbine, which produces power to drive the compressor and the electrical generator. An oxidiser is provided to ensure combustion is complete. Such a hybrid system is referred to as a ‘direct fired turbine’ system.

Hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine systems are currently under development and no doubt they will appear in the future. They may first find application in distributed power generation, where power is generated close to the user’s site as opposed to centralised power generation, where power is transmitted to users over long distances. Fuel cells may also be used in co-generation systems, where both power and heat/cooling loads are needed by the user.

It must be pointed out that complex gas turbine cycles may also compete for distributed power generation, but will probably include a fuel cell when fully developed. Such complex cycles used in conjunction with fuel cells may be capable of practical thermal efficiencies in excess of 70%.

Combined cycle gas turbines using a dual pressure system can achieve thermal efficiencies exceeding 55%. Triple pressure combined cycle gas turbines using a reheat gas turbine to increase the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature are being actively proposed. It is claimed that such systems are capable of achieving a thermal efficiency in the order of 60%. The pinch points and the terminal temperature difference should be about 20 °C for a boiler of economic size. The gas exit temperature should be above 120 °C to prevent corrosion.

# Co-generation systems

Industries often require both power and heating loads. In these instances, the exhaust heat from the gas turbine may be used to provide the necessary heating load. Such systems are referred to as co-generation or combined heat and power. The steam generated by the boiler is now used for heating purposes rather than producing power. An overall efficiency of 90% is possible with co-generation systems, but the major problem is low efficiencies when heating.

# 3.7 Hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine system

The employment of heat engines such as gas turbines in the production of electricity involves the gas turbine producing mechanical power, which is then converted to electrical energy by a generator. A fuel cell, on the other hand, directly converts chemical energy such as hydrogen in the presence of oxygen into electrical energy by an electrochemical reaction. As a result, the efficiency of conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy is not constrained by the Carnot efficiency. Thus, in theory, all the chemical energy can be converted into electrical energy, so achieving an equivalent thermal efficiency of 100%. In practice, however, about 80% of the energy can be converted directly into electricity. The electricity produced by fuel cells is direct current (DC) which is converted to alternating current by the use of an inverter.

Although fuel cells can use oxygen from the air, the lack of abundant hydrogen requires this element to be produced from hydrocarbons such as natural gas. This process is referred to as ‘reforming’ where steam reacts with the hydrocarbon to produce hydrogen, and carbon monoxide, which is oxidised to carbon dioxide. Thus a significant amount of energy from the fuel is lost and the overall efficiency of the fuel cells decreases to about 40%. Currently, fuel cells manufactured using solid-state material are being considered, which also carry out the reforming process but need to operate at high temperatures, typically at about 1000 degrees Celsius. The energy conversion efficiency of these fuel cells, known as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), is only about 50%. Nonetheless, this represents an impressive thermal efficiency. Another type of fuel cell that has been considered for use with hydrocarbon fuels and air is the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC).

The exhaust heat from such fuel cells, still at a high temperature, may be used to generate electricity via a heat engine. By combining such fuel cells with a gas turbine, practical thermal efficiencies approaching 70% can be achieved.⁵ A schematic representation of a hybrid fuel cell–gas turbine system is shown in Fig. 3.38.
