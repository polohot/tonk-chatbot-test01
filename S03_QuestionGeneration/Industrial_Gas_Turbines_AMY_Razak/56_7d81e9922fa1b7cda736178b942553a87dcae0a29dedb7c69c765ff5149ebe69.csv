The process begins with the gas turbine drawing in air and compressing it using a high-pressure compressor. Fuel is then injected into the compressed air and ignited in the combustion chamber, resulting in high-temperature, high-pressure gases. These gases expand through the turbine, causing it to spin.

The spinning turbine is connected to a generator. As the turbine rotates, it drives the generator, which converts the mechanical energy from the turbine into electrical energy. The generator typically produces alternating current (AC) electricity, which is then distributed for use. In some systems, the electricity produced may initially be in direct current (DC) form, requiring an inverter to convert it to AC for distribution. Thus, the generator plays a crucial role in transforming the mechanical power from the gas turbine into usable electrical energy."
