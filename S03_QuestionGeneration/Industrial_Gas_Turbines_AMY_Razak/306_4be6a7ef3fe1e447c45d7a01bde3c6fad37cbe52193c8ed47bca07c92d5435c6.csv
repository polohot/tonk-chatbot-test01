The VIGV starts to open as soon as the set point in power demand from the gas turbine increases, whereas, in the case described in Fig. 20.3, the VIGV starts to open only when the EGT exceeds the set point (650 K) for VIGV control. Thus, there is a period of engine operation when the VIGV remains closed at low gas turbine power outputs, which is absent in the present case.

During the closed loop response, the VIGV sufficiently closes so that the EGT returns to the set point specified for VIGV control. This results in a decrease in compressor capacity by shifting the compressor speed lines to the left, as shown in Fig. 20.16. The operating points on the compressor characteristic are also shown during open and closed loop response of the VIGV control system. It is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio decreases during the closed loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.16. ",What triggers the VIGV to start opening in the scenario described in the text?,The VIGV starts to open as soon as the set point in power demand from the gas turbine increases.,An increase in the set point for power demand from the gas turbine initiates the opening of the VIGV.,Opening of the VIGV is triggered by an increase in the power demand set point of the gas turbine.,The initial trigger for VIGV opening is the rise in the gas turbine's power demand set point.,"When the gas turbine's power demand set point increases, the VIGV begins to open."
