# Part I

# Principles of gas turbine performance

The book has three parts. Part I deals with the theory of gas turbine performance applied to industrial gas turbines and discusses the principle of gas turbine combustion and control. The principles of compressors and turbines are also included in order to introduce the concept of component characteristics, which is of paramount importance in the prediction of off-design performance of gas turbines.

In Parts II and III, we revisit Part I to further explain the concepts behind gas turbine performance and operability using gas turbine simulators in a series of simulations. We first consider the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. This is the most common configuration based on the number of gas turbines operating in the field although, on an installed power basis, the single-shaft gas turbine is more common. Furthermore, the concept of (approximate) unique running lines prevalent within a two-shaft gas turbine facilitates easier understanding of gas turbine performance, and therefore makes it worth considering before the single-shaft gas turbine simulator.

# 12 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

It was stated in Chapter 1 that gas turbines produce power by converting heat into work and that the heat input is achieved by burning fuel in the combustion system. Thus the performance analysis of a gas turbine is best achieved by applying the principles of thermodynamics. Two of the laws of thermodynamics concern us regarding gas turbine cycles: the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. There are many definitions of these laws, particularly the second law of thermodynamics. The following definitions will be used.

# 2.1 The first law of thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics states simply that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can only be converted from one type or form to another. For example, if we supply 10 MJ of heat into a thermodynamic system operating in a cycle to produce work, then only up to 10 MJ of work can be produced.

# 2.2 The second law of thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics is normally associated with a heat engine. A heat engine is a device operating in a cycle, producing work from a heat source and rejecting heat to a heat sink as shown in Fig. 2.1. ",What are the main topics covered in Part I of the book 'Principles of gas turbine performance'?,"Part I covers the theory of gas turbine performance, including the principles of gas turbine combustion and control, and the fundamentals of compressors and turbines.","The main focus of Part I is on the theoretical aspects of gas turbine performance, such as combustion, control mechanisms, and the basic principles behind compressors and turbines.","In Part I, readers are introduced to the theory behind gas turbine performance, with discussions on combustion, control, and the essential characteristics of compressors and turbines.","Topics in Part I include the application of gas turbine performance theory to industrial gas turbines, emphasizing combustion, control, and the roles of compressors and turbines.","Part I delves into the theoretical foundations of gas turbine performance, highlighting combustion, control systems, and the operational principles of compressors and turbines."
