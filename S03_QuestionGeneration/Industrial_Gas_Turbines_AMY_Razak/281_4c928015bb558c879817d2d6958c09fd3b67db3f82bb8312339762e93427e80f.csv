18.26 Trends in compressor, turbine and maximum-to-minimum cycle temperature are shown due to hot end damage.

The operating point is constrained to operate on a fixed compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient temperature (which is also the compressor inlet temperature), and the compressor speed remain constant. As stated this results in little change in the compressor non-dimensional mass flow and is due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed line.

# 18.4.3 Trends in power and efficiency

The decrease in T₃/T₁ and the compressor pressure ratio result in the reductions in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and power output. At the operating compressor pressure ratios, the loss in power output is largely due to the reduction in T₃/T₁ rather than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. However, the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency is affected by both these parameters. Furthermore, the decrease in the turbine efficiency also affects both the power output and thermal efficiency quite adversely, as shown in Fig. 18.28 (where the trends in gas turbine power and thermal efficiency is shown to be due to hot end damage).

The loss in turbine power due to hot end damage is evident and is shown in Fig. 18.29 (which shows the trends in compressor and turbine powers and efficiencies). The change in compressor power absorbed is much smaller, compared to the change in the turbine power and is primarily due to the significant loss in the turbine efficiency.

18.26 Trends in compressor, turbine and maximum-to-minimum cycle temperature are shown due to hot end damage.

The operating point is constrained to operate on a fixed compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient temperature (which is also the compressor inlet temperature), and the compressor speed remain constant. As stated this results in little change in the compressor non-dimensional mass flow and is due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed line.

# 18.4.3 Trends in power and efficiency

The decrease in T₃/T₁ and the compressor pressure ratio result in the reductions in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and power output. At the operating compressor pressure ratios, the loss in power output is largely due to the reduction in T₃/T₁ rather than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. However, the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency is affected by both these parameters. Furthermore, the decrease in the turbine efficiency also affects both the power output and thermal efficiency quite adversely, as shown in Fig. 18.28 (where the trends in gas turbine power and thermal efficiency is shown to be due to hot end damage).

The loss in turbine power due to hot end damage is evident and is shown in Fig. 18.29 (which shows the trends in compressor and turbine powers and efficiencies). The change in compressor power absorbed is much smaller, compared to the change in the turbine power and is primarily due to the significant loss in the turbine efficiency.

18.26 Trends in compressor, turbine and maximum-to-minimum cycle temperature are shown due to hot end damage.

The operating point is constrained to operate on a fixed compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient temperature (which is also the compressor inlet temperature), and the compressor speed remain constant. As stated this results in little change in the compressor non-dimensional mass flow and is due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed line.

# 18.4.3 Trends in power and efficiency

The decrease in T₃/T₁ and the compressor pressure ratio result in the reductions in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and power output. At the operating compressor pressure ratios, the loss in power output is largely due to the reduction in T₃/T₁ rather than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. However, the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency is affected by both these parameters. Furthermore, the decrease in the turbine efficiency also affects both the power output and thermal efficiency quite adversely, as shown in Fig. 18.28 (where the trends in gas turbine power and thermal efficiency is shown to be due to hot end damage).

The loss in turbine power due to hot end damage is evident and is shown in Fig. 18.29 (which shows the trends in compressor and turbine powers and efficiencies). The change in compressor power absorbed is much smaller, compared to the change in the turbine power and is primarily due to the significant loss in the turbine efficiency.

# 18.28 Trends in gas turbine and generator power outputs, and thermal efficiency due to the effect of hot end damage.

# 18.4.4 Trends in pressure and temperature

As the ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure remain constant, the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and the turbine pressure ratio result in decreases in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet.
