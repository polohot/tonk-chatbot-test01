A vortex is a region in a fluid where the flow revolves around an axis line, which can be straight or curved. 

The statement that ""the velocity at the eye of each vortex is zero and increases towards the tip of the vortex"" illustrates a fundamental characteristic of vortices. At the center, or ""eye,"" of the vortex, the fluid particles experience minimal movement, resulting in a velocity of zero. As you move outward from the center towards the edges or tips of the vortex, the velocity of the fluid increases. This increase in velocity is due to the conservation of angular momentum; as fluid particles move closer to the axis of rotation, they must speed up to conserve this momentum.

In practical applications, understanding vortex velocity is essential for predicting how fluids behave in various scenarios, such as in the design of industrial gas turbines, where the efficiency of airflow can significantly impact performance. The velocity profile within a vortex can influence factors like lift and drag in aerodynamics, mixing in chemical processes, and the stability of flows in various engineering applications.

In a vortex, the fluid particles experience a change in velocity as they move from the center (eye) to the outer edges. 

According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act upon it. In the case of a vortex, as the fluid moves outward from the center, it accelerates due to the pressure differences created by the rotational motion. The increase in velocity towards the tip of the vortex indicates that the fluid is gaining kinetic energy, which corresponds to a redistribution of momentum within the system.

As the fluid accelerates outward, it exerts a force on the surrounding fluid, which in turn maintains the overall momentum balance of the vortex system. This interaction illustrates how the conservation of momentum governs the behavior of the vortex, ensuring that the momentum lost by the fluid moving inward is balanced by the momentum gained by the fluid moving outward. Thus, the principles of conservation of momentum are fundamental in understanding the dynamics of vortices."
