1. **Identify the temperature** of the air (T) and the saturation vapor pressure (Pₛ) at that temperature. The saturation vapor pressure can be found using empirical formulas or tables.

2. **Calculate the actual vapor pressure (P)** using the relative humidity (RH) as follows:
   \[
   P = \text{RH} \times Pₛ
   \]
   where RH is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 50% relative humidity = 0.50).

3. **Calculate the specific humidity (SH)** using the formula:
   \[
   SH = \frac{0.622 \times P}{P_{\text{atm}} - P}
   \]
   where \( P_{\text{atm}} \) is the atmospheric pressure.

This will give you the specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air."

1. **Accurate Performance Assessment**: By accounting for the heat input needed to raise the temperature of water vapour from the compressor discharge temperature (T₂) to the turbine entry temperature (T₃), engineers can more accurately assess the thermal performance of the gas turbine. This ensures that the calculations reflect the actual conditions within the turbine.

2. **Impact on Efficiency**: The additional heat input affects the thermal efficiency (ηth) of the gas turbine. An accurate calculation helps in optimizing the design and operation of the turbine, leading to improved efficiency and reduced fuel consumption.

3. **Gas Composition Consideration**: The calculation acknowledges the change in gas composition during combustion, which is essential for understanding how different components, including water vapour, influence the combustion process and overall energy output.

4. **Design Optimization**: Understanding the heat input requirements allows for better design choices in turbine components and systems, ensuring that they can handle the thermal loads effectively and operate within safe limits.

5. **Error Minimization**: As highlighted in the summary of calculations, neglecting the heat input from water vapour can lead to significant errors in performance predictions.
