# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

change in gas composition by using different values for cₚ and γ during expansion. Since these values are closer to the true average values for cₚ and γ, the errors in the calculation of the design point performance are small. It must be pointed out that Method 2 is unsuitable for designing gas turbines and Method 3 should be adopted. However, Method 2 gives a quick way of estimating the design point performance of gas turbines.

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the
