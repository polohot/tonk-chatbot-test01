# 8.3 Three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine

A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is shown in Fig. 8.15. The HP shaft, also known as the HP spool, which consists of the HP compressor driven by its own (HP) turbine, may be considered to act as the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine. The LP turbine will now be the corresponding power turbine. The LP turbine drives its own (LP) compressor, which acts as the load, and together they are referred to as the LP spool. Thus, a unique running line on the HP compressor characteristic will be determined by the swallowing and choking capacity of the LP turbine.

The LP turbine pressure ratio is now determined by the matching of the LP and power turbine characteristics. As discussed for a two-shaft engine, the power turbine swallowing capacity again determines the LP turbine pressure ratio. These details are shown in Figure 8.16. The matching of the turbines for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will also establish a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic.

Referring to Fig. 8.15, the power balance equation between the LP compressor and turbine may be written as follows:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

shown in Figure 8.16. For a given LP turbine efficiency, the non-dimensional temperature drop,  ΔT₅₆/T₅, will therefore be constant. If a constant non-dimensional speed line on the LP compressor characteristic is operated on, then from the previous assumption and discussions, the LP compressor non-dimensional temperature rise,  ΔT₂₁/T₁, will also be constant. Ignoring the changes in specific heats (   cpa and  cpg) and any bleeds,  W₅ =  W₁; it may be concluded from the power balance Equation 8.8 that       T₅/T₁ is also constant.

Similarly, the matching of the HP and LP turbine (Fig. 8.16) results in a constant non-dimensional temperature drop (i.e. ΔT₄₅ /T₄ = Constant) across the HP turbine (assuming constant HP and LP turbine efficiencies). Since is constant, it may be concluded that                                      T₅ T₄ is also constant. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, a constant ΔT₂₁/T₁ will result in a constant T₂. Thus T₄/T₂ is constant, which is the maximum to minimum temperature ratio for the HP spool in a three-shaft gas turbine. It has been stated that the HP spool behaves as a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, while the LP turbine acts as the power turbine. Thus the HP compressor will have a unique running line and the intersection of this running line with the corresponding T₄/T₂ line will fix the HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio,  P₃/P₂. Therefore, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, essentially fixes the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic.

The flow compatibility between the LP and HP compressor may be written as:

W₂P T₂ = W¹P T¹ × P¹ × T₂ × W₂ [8.9]

Since the flow along the compressor speed line is approximately vertical, and using the assumptions stated above,       W₁√T₁/P₁ and  T₂/T₁ will be approximately constant. Ignoring bleeds, W₂ = W₁, for a required W₂√T₂/P₂ (HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow) will result in a unique LP compressor pressure ratio,  P₂/P₁. Thus all LP compressor speed lines will have a unique pressure ratio, and joining these points will generate the unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.17, which also shows the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, and  T₄/T₂, on the LP and HP compressor, respectively. Unlike the HP compressor characteristic where the lines of constant temperature ratio,  T₄/T₂, move towards surge as T₄/T₂ increases, the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, move away from surge on the LP compressor, as shown in Fig. 8.17. At low powers, the running line on the LP compressor characteristic may intersect the surge line and, in this case, a variable geometry LP compressor in the form of VIGVs may be necessary for satisfactory operation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

8.17 Running lines of the LP and HP characteristics for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

Since the lines of temperature T₄/T₁ on the LP compressor characteristic move away from surge, three-shaft engines using a free power turbine do not normally encounter surge during acceleration. However, during deceleration, the reduction of LP surge margin could give rise to LP compressor surge. Again, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes would prevent surge by improving the surge margin due to the closure of the VIGV.

# 8.4 Displacement of running line (three-shaft gas turbine)

A similar analysis as was discussed for a two-shaft engine can be carried out for a three-shaft gas turbine. However, discussion will be restricted to the effects of the changes in the power turbine flow capacity. Making the assumption that the turbines remain choked, the HP spool will be shielded from any change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the choked condition of the LP turbine. Therefore, the running line on the HP compressor characteristic will remain unaffected by any change in the flow capacity of the power turbine.

Increasing the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the LP turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.18. This increase in LP turbine pressure ratio will increase the LP turbine power output. If we consider that the LP compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed, the LP compressor discharge temperature will remain approximately constant. Since the non-dimensional speed lines describing the variation of flow with pressure ratio are steep, there is little variation in mass flow rate through the LP compressor with any change in LP compressor pressure. Thus, the power absorbed by the LP compressor will remain essentially constant with the change in power turbine flow capacity.

The turbine entry temperature, T₄, must therefore reduce to maintain the power LP spool balance. Since the HP compressor-running line is not affected by the change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the LP turbine choked conditions, and T₂ is approximately constant, T₄/T₂ will decrease.

This will force the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic running line to fall to a lower pressure ratio and inlet non-dimensional flow, as illustrated in Fig. 8.19.

8.19 Effect of increasing power turbine capacity on the operating points of the LP and HP characteristics.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Considering the flow identity between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor, as described in Equation 8.9, since T₂/T₁ (constant non-dimensional speed), W /W (no bleeds) and W₁√T₁/P₁ are constant (steep non-dimensional speed lines), any reduction in LP compressor non-dimensional discharge flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, must be accompanied by a reduction in P₁/P₂. This implies that the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁ increases. Thus we see why the turbine entry temperature decreases and the LP compressor pressure ratio increases when the power turbine capacity is increased. This effect is illustrated on the LP compressor characteristic in Fig. 8.19.

Consequently, a reduction in the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and causes the operating point to move along the HP compressor running line to a higher non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. The effect on the LP compressor characteristic will be a decrease in pressure ratio along a given non-dimensional speed line.

# 8.5 Running line for a two-shaft gas turbine

The off-design performance prediction of a two-shaft gas turbine was discussed in Chapter 7. It was also stated that the two-shaft gas turbine case is similar to that of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine but with the LP and power turbine being integrated as one component (Fig. 7.7 in Chapter 7). Therefore, the LP turbine now drives both the LP compressor and load. It was also stated that such a configuration is quite suitable for driving a generator and therefore finds application in electrical power generation. Since the LP compressor, LP turbine and the load operate at a constant speed corresponding to the synchronous speed of the generator, for a given ambient temperature, T₁, the running line will be along a constant non-dimensional speed line on the LP compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.20. ",What is the function of the HP spool in a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine?,"The HP spool acts as the gas generator, consisting of the HP compressor driven by its own HP turbine.","In a three-shaft gas turbine, the HP spool functions similarly to the gas generator in a two-shaft gas turbine, driving the HP compressor.","Functioning as the gas generator, the HP spool in a three-shaft gas turbine includes the HP compressor and its corresponding HP turbine.","The HP spool's role is to generate gas, comprising the HP compressor and HP turbine, akin to a two-shaft gas turbine's gas generator.","Acting as the gas generator, the HP spool drives the HP compressor via the HP turbine in the three-shaft gas turbine setup."

Thus, the power absorbed by the LP compressor will remain essentially constant with the change in power turbine flow capacity.

The turbine entry temperature, T₄, must therefore reduce to maintain the power LP spool balance. Since the HP compressor-running line is not affected by the change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the LP turbine choked conditions, and T₂ is approximately constant, T₄/T₂ will decrease.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Considering the flow identity between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor, as described in Equation 8.9, since T₂/T₁ (constant non-dimensional speed), W /W (no bleeds) and W₁√T₁/P₁ are constant (steep non-dimensional speed lines), any reduction in LP compressor non-dimensional discharge flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, must be accompanied by a reduction in P₁/P₂. This implies that the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁ increases. Thus we see why the turbine entry temperature decreases and the LP compressor pressure ratio increases when the power turbine capacity is increased. This effect is illustrated on the LP compressor characteristic in Fig. 8.19.

Consequently, a reduction in the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and causes the operating point to move along the HP compressor running line to a higher non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. The effect on the LP compressor characteristic will be a decrease in pressure ratio along a given non-dimensional speed line.

The off-design performance prediction of a two-shaft gas turbine was discussed in Chapter 7. It was also stated that the two-shaft gas turbine case is similar to that of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine but with the LP and power turbine being integrated as one component (Fig. 7.7 in Chapter 7). Therefore, the LP turbine now drives both the LP compressor and load. It was also stated that such a configuration is quite suitable for driving a generator and therefore finds application in electrical power generation. Since the LP compressor, LP turbine and the load operate at a constant speed corresponding to the synchronous speed of the generator, for a given ambient temperature, T₁, the running line will be along a constant non-dimensional speed line on the LP compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.20.

# 8.3 Three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine

A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is shown in Fig. 8.15. The HP shaft, also known as the HP spool, which consists of the HP compressor driven by its own (HP) turbine, may be considered to act as the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine. The LP turbine will now be the corresponding power turbine. The LP turbine drives its own (LP) compressor, which acts as the load, and together they are referred to as the LP spool. Thus, a unique running line on the HP compressor characteristic will be determined by the swallowing and choking capacity of the LP turbine.

The LP turbine pressure ratio is now determined by the matching of the LP and power turbine characteristics. As discussed for a two-shaft engine, the power turbine swallowing capacity again determines the LP turbine pressure ratio. These details are shown in Figure 8.16. The matching of the turbines for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will also establish a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic.

shown in Figure 8.16. For a given LP turbine efficiency, the non-dimensional temperature drop,  ΔT₅₆/T₅, will therefore be constant. If a constant non-dimensional speed line on the LP compressor characteristic is operated on, then from the previous assumption and discussions, the LP compressor non-dimensional temperature rise,  ΔT₂₁/T₁, will also be constant. Ignoring the changes in specific heats (   cpa and  cpg) and any bleeds,  W₅ =  W₁; it may be concluded from the power balance Equation 8.8 that       T₅/T₁ is also constant.

Similarly, the matching of the HP and LP turbine (Fig. 8.16) results in a constant non-dimensional temperature drop (i.e. ΔT₄₅ /T₄ = Constant) across the HP turbine (assuming constant HP and LP turbine efficiencies). Since is constant, it may be concluded that                                      T₅ T₄ is also constant. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, a constant ΔT₂₁/T₁ will result in a constant T₂. Thus T₄/T₂ is constant, which is the maximum to minimum temperature ratio for the HP spool in a three-shaft gas turbine. It has been stated that the HP spool behaves as a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, while the LP turbine acts as the power turbine. Thus the HP compressor will have a unique running line and the intersection of this running line with the corresponding T₄/T₂ line will fix the HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio,  P₃/P₂. Therefore, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, essentially fixes the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic.

The flow compatibility between the LP and HP compressor may be written as:

W₂P T₂ = W¹P T¹ × P¹ × T₂ × W₂ [8.9]

Since the flow along the compressor speed line is approximately vertical, and using the assumptions stated above,       W₁√T₁/P₁ and  T₂/T₁ will be approximately constant. Ignoring bleeds, W₂ = W₁, for a required W₂√T₂/P₂ (HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow) will result in a unique LP compressor pressure ratio,  P₂/P₁. Thus all LP compressor speed lines will have a unique pressure ratio, and joining these points will generate the unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.17, which also shows the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, and  T₄/T₂, on the LP and HP compressor, respectively. Unlike the HP compressor characteristic where the lines of constant temperature ratio,  T₄/T₂, move towards surge as T₄/T₂ increases, the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, move away from surge on the LP compressor, as shown in Fig. 8.17. At low powers, the running line on the LP compressor characteristic may intersect the surge line and, in this case, a variable geometry LP compressor in the form of VIGVs may be necessary for satisfactory operation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

8.17 Running lines of the LP and HP characteristics for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

Since the lines of temperature T₄/T₁ on the LP compressor characteristic move away from surge, three-shaft engines using a free power turbine do not normally encounter surge during acceleration. However, during deceleration, the reduction of LP surge margin could give rise to LP compressor surge. Again, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes would prevent surge by improving the surge margin due to the closure of the VIGV.

# 8.4 Displacement of running line (three-shaft gas turbine)

A similar analysis as was discussed for a two-shaft engine can be carried out for a three-shaft gas turbine. However, discussion will be restricted to the effects of the changes in the power turbine flow capacity. Making the assumption that the turbines remain choked, the HP spool will be shielded from any change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the choked condition of the LP turbine. Therefore, the running line on the HP compressor characteristic will remain unaffected by any change in the flow capacity of the power turbine.

Increasing the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the LP turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.18. This increase in LP turbine pressure ratio will increase the LP turbine power output. If we consider that the LP compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed, the LP compressor discharge temperature will remain approximately constant. Since the non-dimensional speed lines describing the variation of flow with pressure ratio are steep, there is little variation in mass flow rate through the LP compressor with any change in LP compressor pressure.

Since is constant, it may be concluded that                                      T₅ T₄ is also constant. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, a constant ΔT₂₁/T₁ will result in a constant T₂. Thus T₄/T₂ is constant, which is the maximum to minimum temperature ratio for the HP spool in a three-shaft gas turbine. It has been stated that the HP spool behaves as a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, while the LP turbine acts as the power turbine. Thus the HP compressor will have a unique running line and the intersection of this running line with the corresponding T₄/T₂ line will fix the HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio,  P₃/P₂. Therefore, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, essentially fixes the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic.

The flow compatibility between the LP and HP compressor may be written as:

W₂P T₂ = W¹P T¹ × P¹ × T₂ × W₂ [8.9]

Since the flow along the compressor speed line is approximately vertical, and using the assumptions stated above,       W₁√T₁/P₁ and  T₂/T₁ will be approximately constant. Ignoring bleeds, W₂ = W₁, for a required W₂√T₂/P₂ (HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow) will result in a unique LP compressor pressure ratio,  P₂/P₁. Thus all LP compressor speed lines will have a unique pressure ratio, and joining these points will generate the unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.17, which also shows the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, and  T₄/T₂, on the LP and HP compressor, respectively. Unlike the HP compressor characteristic where the lines of constant temperature ratio,  T₄/T₂, move towards surge as T₄/T₂ increases, the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, move away from surge on the LP compressor, as shown in Fig. 8.17. At low powers, the running line on the LP compressor characteristic may intersect the surge line and, in this case, a variable geometry LP compressor in the form of VIGVs may be necessary for satisfactory operation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

8.17 Running lines of the LP and HP characteristics for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

Since the lines of temperature T₄/T₁ on the LP compressor characteristic move away from surge, three-shaft engines using a free power turbine do not normally encounter surge during acceleration. However, during deceleration, the reduction of LP surge margin could give rise to LP compressor surge. Again, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes would prevent surge by improving the surge margin due to the closure of the VIGV.

# 8.4 Displacement of running line (three-shaft gas turbine)

A similar analysis as was discussed for a two-shaft engine can be carried out for a three-shaft gas turbine. However, discussion will be restricted to the effects of the changes in the power turbine flow capacity. Making the assumption that the turbines remain choked, the HP spool will be shielded from any change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the choked condition of the LP turbine. Therefore, the running line on the HP compressor characteristic will remain unaffected by any change in the flow capacity of the power turbine.

Increasing the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the LP turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.18. This increase in LP turbine pressure ratio will increase the LP turbine power output. If we consider that the LP compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed, the LP compressor discharge temperature will remain approximately constant. Since the non-dimensional speed lines describing the variation of flow with pressure ratio are steep, there is little variation in mass flow rate through the LP compressor with any change in LP compressor pressure. Thus, the power absorbed by the LP compressor will remain essentially constant with the change in power turbine flow capacity.

The turbine entry temperature, T₄, must therefore reduce to maintain the power LP spool balance. Since the HP compressor-running line is not affected by the change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the LP turbine choked conditions, and T₂ is approximately constant, T₄/T₂ will decrease.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Considering the flow identity between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor, as described in Equation 8.9, since T₂/T₁ (constant non-dimensional speed), W /W (no bleeds) and W₁√T₁/P₁ are constant (steep non-dimensional speed lines), any reduction in LP compressor non-dimensional discharge flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, must be accompanied by a reduction in P₁/P₂. This implies that the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁ increases. Thus we see why the turbine entry temperature decreases and the LP compressor pressure ratio increases when the power turbine capacity is increased. This effect is illustrated on the LP compressor characteristic in Fig. 8.19.

Consequently, a reduction in the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and causes the operating point to move along the HP compressor running line to a higher non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. The effect on the LP compressor characteristic will be a decrease in pressure ratio along a given non-dimensional speed line.

# 8.5 Running line for a two-shaft gas turbine

The off-design performance prediction of a two-shaft gas turbine was discussed in Chapter 7. It was also stated that the two-shaft gas turbine case is similar to that of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine but with the LP and power turbine being integrated as one component (Fig. 7.7 in Chapter 7). Therefore, the LP turbine now drives both the LP compressor and load. It was also stated that such a configuration is quite suitable for driving a generator and therefore finds application in electrical power generation. Since the LP compressor, LP turbine and the load operate at a constant speed corresponding to the synchronous speed of the generator, for a given ambient temperature, T₁, the running line will be along a constant non-dimensional speed line on the LP compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.20. ",What role does the LP compressor play in a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine?,"The LP compressor acts as the load driven by the LP turbine, forming the LP spool together.","In this setup, the LP compressor serves as the load for the LP turbine, collectively known as the LP spool.","Functioning as the load, the LP compressor is powered by the LP turbine, constituting the LP spool.","The LP compressor's role is to be the load that the LP turbine drives, making up the LP spool in the process.","As part of the LP spool, the LP compressor is driven by the LP turbine, acting as the system's load."

A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is shown in Fig. 8.15. The HP shaft, also known as the HP spool, which consists of the HP compressor driven by its own (HP) turbine, may be considered to act as the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine. The LP turbine will now be the corresponding power turbine. The LP turbine drives its own (LP) compressor, which acts as the load, and together they are referred to as the LP spool. Thus, a unique running line on the HP compressor characteristic will be determined by the swallowing and choking capacity of the LP turbine.

The LP turbine pressure ratio is now determined by the matching of the LP and power turbine characteristics. As discussed for a two-shaft engine, the power turbine swallowing capacity again determines the LP turbine pressure ratio. These details are shown in Figure 8.16. The matching of the turbines for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will also establish a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic.

# 8.3 Three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine

A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is shown in Fig. 8.15. The HP shaft, also known as the HP spool, which consists of the HP compressor driven by its own (HP) turbine, may be considered to act as the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine. The LP turbine will now be the corresponding power turbine. The LP turbine drives its own (LP) compressor, which acts as the load, and together they are referred to as the LP spool. Thus, a unique running line on the HP compressor characteristic will be determined by the swallowing and choking capacity of the LP turbine.

The LP turbine pressure ratio is now determined by the matching of the LP and power turbine characteristics. As discussed for a two-shaft engine, the power turbine swallowing capacity again determines the LP turbine pressure ratio. These details are shown in Figure 8.16. The matching of the turbines for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will also establish a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic.

Referring to Fig. 8.15, the power balance equation between the LP compressor and turbine may be written as follows:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

shown in Figure 8.16. For a given LP turbine efficiency, the non-dimensional temperature drop,  ΔT₅₆/T₅, will therefore be constant. If a constant non-dimensional speed line on the LP compressor characteristic is operated on, then from the previous assumption and discussions, the LP compressor non-dimensional temperature rise,  ΔT₂₁/T₁, will also be constant. Ignoring the changes in specific heats (   cpa and  cpg) and any bleeds,  W₅ =  W₁; it may be concluded from the power balance Equation 8.8 that       T₅/T₁ is also constant.

Similarly, the matching of the HP and LP turbine (Fig. 8.16) results in a constant non-dimensional temperature drop (i.e. ΔT₄₅ /T₄ = Constant) across the HP turbine (assuming constant HP and LP turbine efficiencies). Since is constant, it may be concluded that                                      T₅ T₄ is also constant. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, a constant ΔT₂₁/T₁ will result in a constant T₂. Thus T₄/T₂ is constant, which is the maximum to minimum temperature ratio for the HP spool in a three-shaft gas turbine. It has been stated that the HP spool behaves as a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, while the LP turbine acts as the power turbine. Thus the HP compressor will have a unique running line and the intersection of this running line with the corresponding T₄/T₂ line will fix the HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio,  P₃/P₂. Therefore, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, essentially fixes the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic.

The flow compatibility between the LP and HP compressor may be written as:

W₂P T₂ = W¹P T¹ × P¹ × T₂ × W₂ [8.9]

Since the flow along the compressor speed line is approximately vertical, and using the assumptions stated above,       W₁√T₁/P₁ and  T₂/T₁ will be approximately constant. Ignoring bleeds, W₂ = W₁, for a required W₂√T₂/P₂ (HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow) will result in a unique LP compressor pressure ratio,  P₂/P₁. Thus all LP compressor speed lines will have a unique pressure ratio, and joining these points will generate the unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.17, which also shows the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, and  T₄/T₂, on the LP and HP compressor, respectively. Unlike the HP compressor characteristic where the lines of constant temperature ratio,  T₄/T₂, move towards surge as T₄/T₂ increases, the lines of constant temperature ratio, T₄/T₁, move away from surge on the LP compressor, as shown in Fig. 8.17. At low powers, the running line on the LP compressor characteristic may intersect the surge line and, in this case, a variable geometry LP compressor in the form of VIGVs may be necessary for satisfactory operation of a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

8.17 Running lines of the LP and HP characteristics for a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

Since the lines of temperature T₄/T₁ on the LP compressor characteristic move away from surge, three-shaft engines using a free power turbine do not normally encounter surge during acceleration. However, during deceleration, the reduction of LP surge margin could give rise to LP compressor surge. Again, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes would prevent surge by improving the surge margin due to the closure of the VIGV.

# 8.4 Displacement of running line (three-shaft gas turbine)

A similar analysis as was discussed for a two-shaft engine can be carried out for a three-shaft gas turbine. However, discussion will be restricted to the effects of the changes in the power turbine flow capacity. Making the assumption that the turbines remain choked, the HP spool will be shielded from any change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the choked condition of the LP turbine. Therefore, the running line on the HP compressor characteristic will remain unaffected by any change in the flow capacity of the power turbine.

Increasing the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the LP turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.18. This increase in LP turbine pressure ratio will increase the LP turbine power output. If we consider that the LP compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed, the LP compressor discharge temperature will remain approximately constant. Since the non-dimensional speed lines describing the variation of flow with pressure ratio are steep, there is little variation in mass flow rate through the LP compressor with any change in LP compressor pressure. Thus, the power absorbed by the LP compressor will remain essentially constant with the change in power turbine flow capacity.

The turbine entry temperature, T₄, must therefore reduce to maintain the power LP spool balance. Since the HP compressor-running line is not affected by the change in the power turbine flow capacity due to the LP turbine choked conditions, and T₂ is approximately constant, T₄/T₂ will decrease.

8.19 Effect of increasing power turbine capacity on the operating points of the LP and HP characteristics.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Considering the flow identity between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor, as described in Equation 8.9, since T₂/T₁ (constant non-dimensional speed), W /W (no bleeds) and W₁√T₁/P₁ are constant (steep non-dimensional speed lines), any reduction in LP compressor non-dimensional discharge flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, must be accompanied by a reduction in P₁/P₂. This implies that the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁ increases. Thus we see why the turbine entry temperature decreases and the LP compressor pressure ratio increases when the power turbine capacity is increased. This effect is illustrated on the LP compressor characteristic in Fig. 8.19.

Consequently, a reduction in the power turbine flow capacity will result in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and causes the operating point to move along the HP compressor running line to a higher non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. The effect on the LP compressor characteristic will be a decrease in pressure ratio along a given non-dimensional speed line.
