Nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) of the power turbine at low power conditions. If the choice is made to modulate the NGV to maintain the EGT, then it may not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine as the engine is already on the EGT limit. However, an open loop control response may be included to overcome the problem, similar to that discussed in Section 10.4.2. With such a control system the NGVs are opened fully for a fixed period of time, thus reducing the EGT. This will enable the engine power output to reach the increased power demand before the control system switches to the closed loop mode where the NGV is closed sufficiently to maintain the EGT on its limiting value.

Such a control strategy can maintain the EGT on the limiting value at off-design conditions; however, during transient operation, the EGT may be reduced and the use of such a control strategy in DLE combustion engines may lead to the fuel–air ratio exceeding the lower extinction limit, causing tripping of the engine. An alternative control strategy may be proposed, which is similar to that also discussed in Section 10.4.2, where the NGV is modulated to alter the power output from the gas turbine and the fuel flow is modulated to maintain the EGT on the limiting value. Such a control strategy will eliminate the need of an open loop response as discussed.

Previously, Figure 10.12 shows a schematic representation of such a control system applied to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

# 10.5 Starting and shutdown

Starting a gas turbine is probably one of the most difficult aspects of engine operation. The process begins with the turning or cranking of the engine using an external power source such as an electric starter motor. Other types of starters include air turbines and hydraulic motors. 3,4 The speed of the compressor must be high enough (about 20% of design speed) to build up sufficient mass flow and pressure in the combustion system so that ignition can be initiated. The igniters are initiated and the fuel is admitted into the combustion system. When ignition occurs, the increased turbine power will accelerate the engine. However, the starter motor will still be engaged, as the compressor speed is too low and the compressor efficiency is therefore poor. Thus, disengaging the starter motor too soon will result in the engine coasting down. Another problem during starting is ‘hanging’ and this is due to insufficient fuel flow or starter motor power. The failure of all the burners to light-up during starting will result in reduced heat input and this can result in a hanged start. Hanging therefore results in a very slow or even no acceleration of the engine during starting. This aspect is discussed further in Harman and Walsh and Fletcher.⁴

# 276 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Starting power demand must be minimised and this is achieved in multi-spooled engines by rotation of only one of the spools, usually the HP spool. Blow-off valves are opened to ensure satisfactory surge margin during starting. The power demand for starting large single-shaft gas turbines can be very large. The compressors of these engines are usually fitted with VIGVs to reduce the mass flow rate, thus decreasing the starting power demands of such gas turbines. These guide vanes are then fully opened during normal operation using a control strategy described in Section 10.4.2.

Although the above gives an overview of the starting process of a gas turbine, there are other sequences or phases that have to be passed before ignition can be initiated. One such sequence is purging where the cranking of the engine is carried without any combustion to clear the combustion system and the engine from fuel–air mixtures that can ignite in an uncontrolled manner and result in an explosion. This is particularly so for natural gas-fired engines where fuel gas can leak into the engine and present an explosive hazard. With liquid-fuelled engines using diesel or kerosene, purging is normally carried out after a trip, where fuel can be still flowing into the combustion system during coasting down after a flameout situation. The liquid fuel contacts the hot engine components and vaporises to forming an explosive mixture when mixed with the air stream.

After successful starting, the engine operates at idle conditions for a period, referred to as thermal soaking, when the engine components can achieve a new operating temperature. Thermal soaking is important in reducing the thermal stressing and minimising life usage. The idle speed is also important and must be above any critical speed to prevent resonance resulting in high engine vibration. A typical idle speed range for gas turbines is between 40% and 70% of the design speed and should be low enough to minimise idle power output of the engine. Figure 10.13 shows the speed–time display during the starting process for a single-shaft gas turbine. The figure also shows the major phases of the starting sequence. The starting torque required and turbine entry temperature (TET) during starting are shown in Fig. 10.14. Note the higher TET requirements at low speeds, which are due to low compressor and turbine efficiencies during low speeds.

It may be thought that shutting down a gas turbine is much simpler and more easily achieved by shutting off the fuel flow to the engine. However, such rapid shutdowns, which occur during engine trips, can cause rapid shrinkage of engine components resulting in temporary or even permanent seizure of the engine. The normal process of shutdown is to bring the engine to idle, where it remains for a suitable cooling down period, before the fuel flow is shut off to shutdown the engine. The cooling down period depends on the engine size, a large engine requiring a long idle period before shutdown.

After successful starting, the engine operates at idle conditions for a period, referred to as thermal soaking, when the engine components can achieve a new operating temperature. Thermal soaking is important in reducing the thermal stressing and minimising life usage. The idle speed is also important and must be above any critical speed to prevent resonance resulting in high engine vibration. A typical idle speed range for gas turbines is between 40% and 70% of the design speed and should be low enough to minimise idle power output of the engine. Figure 10.13 shows the speed–time display during the starting process for a single-shaft gas turbine. The figure also shows the major phases of the starting sequence. The starting torque required and turbine entry temperature (TET) during starting are shown in Fig. 10.14. Note the higher TET requirements at low speeds, which are due to low compressor and turbine efficiencies during low speeds.

It may be thought that shutting down a gas turbine is much simpler and more easily achieved by shutting off the fuel flow to the engine. However, such rapid shutdowns, which occur during engine trips, can cause rapid shrinkage of engine components resulting in temporary or even permanent seizure of the engine. The normal process of shutdown is to bring the engine to idle, where it remains for a suitable cooling down period, before the fuel flow is shut off to shutdown the engine. The cooling down period depends on the engine size, a large engine requiring a long idle period before shutdown.

If the choice is made to modulate the NGV to maintain the EGT, then it may not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine as the engine is already on the EGT limit. However, an open loop control response may be included to overcome the problem, similar to that discussed in Section 10.4.2. With such a control system the NGVs are opened fully for a fixed period of time, thus reducing the EGT. This will enable the engine power output to reach the increased power demand before the control system switches to the closed loop mode where the NGV is closed sufficiently to maintain the EGT on its limiting value.

Such a control strategy can maintain the EGT on the limiting value at off-design conditions; however, during transient operation, the EGT may be reduced and the use of such a control strategy in DLE combustion engines may lead to the fuel–air ratio exceeding the lower extinction limit, causing tripping of the engine. An alternative control strategy may be proposed, which is similar to that also discussed in Section 10.4.2, where the NGV is modulated to alter the power output from the gas turbine and the fuel flow is modulated to maintain the EGT on the limiting value.

# 10.5 Starting and shutdown

Starting a gas turbine is probably one of the most difficult aspects of engine operation. The process begins with the turning or cranking of the engine using an external power source such as an electric starter motor. Other types of starters include air turbines and hydraulic motors. 3,4 The speed of the compressor must be high enough (about 20% of design speed) to build up sufficient mass flow and pressure in the combustion system so that ignition can be initiated. The igniters are initiated and the fuel is admitted into the combustion system. When ignition occurs, the increased turbine power will accelerate the engine. However, the starter motor will still be engaged, as the compressor speed is too low and the compressor efficiency is therefore poor. Thus, disengaging the starter motor too soon will result in the engine coasting down. Another problem during starting is ‘hanging’ and this is due to insufficient fuel flow or starter motor power. The failure of all the burners to light-up during starting will result in reduced heat input and this can result in a hanged start. Hanging therefore results in a very slow or even no acceleration of the engine during starting. This aspect is discussed further in Harman and Walsh and Fletcher.⁴

# 276 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Starting power demand must be minimised and this is achieved in multi-spooled engines by rotation of only one of the spools, usually the HP spool. Blow-off valves are opened to ensure satisfactory surge margin during starting. The power demand for starting large single-shaft gas turbines can be very large. The compressors of these engines are usually fitted with VIGVs to reduce the mass flow rate, thus decreasing the starting power demands of such gas turbines. These guide vanes are then fully opened during normal operation using a control strategy described in Section 10.4.2.

Although the above gives an overview of the starting process of a gas turbine, there are other sequences or phases that have to be passed before ignition can be initiated. One such sequence is purging where the cranking of the engine is carried without any combustion to clear the combustion system and the engine from fuel–air mixtures that can ignite in an uncontrolled manner and result in an explosion. This is particularly so for natural gas-fired engines where fuel gas can leak into the engine and present an explosive hazard. With liquid-fuelled engines using diesel or kerosene, purging is normally carried out after a trip, where fuel can be still flowing into the combustion system during coasting down after a flameout situation.

The process begins with the turning or cranking of the engine using an external power source such as an electric starter motor. Other types of starters include air turbines and hydraulic motors. 3,4 The speed of the compressor must be high enough (about 20% of design speed) to build up sufficient mass flow and pressure in the combustion system so that ignition can be initiated. The igniters are initiated and the fuel is admitted into the combustion system. When ignition occurs, the increased turbine power will accelerate the engine. However, the starter motor will still be engaged, as the compressor speed is too low and the compressor efficiency is therefore poor. Thus, disengaging the starter motor too soon will result in the engine coasting down. Another problem during starting is ‘hanging’ and this is due to insufficient fuel flow or starter motor power. The failure of all the burners to light-up during starting will result in reduced heat input and this can result in a hanged start. Hanging therefore results in a very slow or even no acceleration of the engine during starting. This aspect is discussed further in Harman and Walsh and Fletcher.⁴

Starting power demand must be minimised and this is achieved in multi-spooled engines by rotation of only one of the spools, usually the HP spool. Blow-off valves are opened to ensure satisfactory surge margin during starting. The power demand for starting large single-shaft gas turbines can be very large. The compressors of these engines are usually fitted with VIGVs to reduce the mass flow rate, thus decreasing the starting power demands of such gas turbines. These guide vanes are then fully opened during normal operation using a control strategy described in Section 10.4.2.

Although the above gives an overview of the starting process of a gas turbine, there are other sequences or phases that have to be passed before ignition can be initiated. One such sequence is purging where the cranking of the engine is carried without any combustion to clear the combustion system and the engine from fuel–air mixtures that can ignite in an uncontrolled manner and result in an explosion. This is particularly so for natural gas-fired engines where fuel gas can leak into the engine and present an explosive hazard. With liquid-fuelled engines using diesel or kerosene, purging is normally carried out after a trip, where fuel can be still flowing into the combustion system during coasting down after a flameout situation. The liquid fuel contacts the hot engine components and vaporises to forming an explosive mixture when mixed with the air stream.

After successful starting, the engine operates at idle conditions for a period, referred to as thermal soaking, when the engine components can achieve a new operating temperature. Thermal soaking is important in reducing the thermal stressing and minimising life usage. The idle speed is also important and must be above any critical speed to prevent resonance resulting in high engine vibration. A typical idle speed range for gas turbines is between 40% and 70% of the design speed and should be low enough to minimise idle power output of the engine. Figure 10.13 shows the speed–time display during the starting process for a single-shaft gas turbine. The figure also shows the major phases of the starting sequence. The starting torque required and turbine entry temperature (TET) during starting are shown in Fig. 10.14. Note the higher TET requirements at low speeds, which are due to low compressor and turbine efficiencies during low speeds.

It may be thought that shutting down a gas turbine is much simpler and more easily achieved by shutting off the fuel flow to the engine. However, such rapid shutdowns, which occur during engine trips, can cause rapid shrinkage of engine components resulting in temporary or even permanent seizure of the engine. The normal process of shutdown is to bring the engine to idle, where it remains for a suitable cooling down period, before the fuel flow is shut off to shutdown the engine. The cooling down period depends on the engine size, a large engine requiring a long idle period before shutdown.

In this event, a low signal selection must be included in the control system, which operates the VIGV as shown in Fig. 10.11. Should the gas turbine power output exceed the maximum power limit, as could happen at low ambient temperature, the effect of low signal selection is to close the VIGV so as to maintain the gas turbine power output and the EGT on their maximum limits.

Nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) of the power turbine at low power conditions. If the choice is made to modulate the NGV to maintain the EGT, then it may not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine as the engine is already on the EGT limit. However, an open loop control response may be included to overcome the problem, similar to that discussed in Section 10.4.2. With such a control system the NGVs are opened fully for a fixed period of time, thus reducing the EGT. This will enable the engine power output to reach the increased power demand before the control system switches to the closed loop mode where the NGV is closed sufficiently to maintain the EGT on its limiting value.

Such a control strategy can maintain the EGT on the limiting value at off-design conditions; however, during transient operation, the EGT may be reduced and the use of such a control strategy in DLE combustion engines may lead to the fuel–air ratio exceeding the lower extinction limit, causing tripping of the engine. An alternative control strategy may be proposed, which is similar to that also discussed in Section 10.4.2, where the NGV is modulated to alter the power output from the gas turbine and the fuel flow is modulated to maintain the EGT on the limiting value. Such a control strategy will eliminate the need of an open loop response as discussed.
