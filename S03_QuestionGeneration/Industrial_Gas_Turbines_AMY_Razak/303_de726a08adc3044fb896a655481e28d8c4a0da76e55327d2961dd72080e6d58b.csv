20.14 Increase in gas turbine power output due to the open and closed loop response of VIGV control system.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

After 15 seconds of open loop response from the VIGV control system, the closed loop response takes over and results in the VIGV closing (Fig. 20.12) to maintain the EGT on the set point for the VIGV control system, which now corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. This results in the VIGV closing from 100% (open loop output) to about 70% (closed loop output) and the increase in the EGT during the closed loop response is shown in Fig. 20.13. ",What temperatures are listed in the table for open loop and closed loop responses?,"The temperatures listed are 1600 K, 1400 K, 1200 K (Turbine entry temperature T3), 1000 K (Exhaust gas temperature limit), 800 K, 600 K (Exhaust gas temperature T4 (EGT)), and 400 K (Compressor discharge temperature T2).","From 1600 K down to 400 K, including specific temperatures like T3 at 1200 K and T4 at 600 K.","Temperatures range from 1600 K to 400 K, with notable mentions of T3 and T4.","Listed temperatures include 1600 K, 1400 K, 1200 K (T3), 1000 K, 800 K, 600 K (T4), and 400 K (T2).","The table specifies temperatures from 1600 K to 400 K, highlighting T3 and T4 among others."
