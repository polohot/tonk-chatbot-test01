The reaction, which refers to the change in momentum of the air as it passes through the rotor and stator, varies along the length of the blade. Specifically, the angles of the relative and absolute velocities (β₁, α₁ for the inlet and β₂, α₂ for the outlet) are critical in defining how the air is deflected and diffused as it moves through the compressor stage.

As the air enters the rotor, it is deflected by the rotor blades at a specific angle, and this deflection is designed to prevent stalling. The design assumes a constant axial velocity (Cₐ), and the work done by the compressor stage is related to the change in tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) as a result of this deflection. The greater the deflection of the air by the rotor blades (β₂ - β₁), the more work is absorbed by the compressor stage, which can lead to increased efficiency and reduced number of stages required to achieve a desired pressure ratio.

In summary, the blade design directly impacts the reaction by determining how effectively the air is deflected and how much work is absorbed, which varies from the root to the tip of the blade."

Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,61,5f0ba205577301c1945382b0e12fe6801eb50452099006a00c1e79ecea5f42c1,Describe the role of rotor velocity in the compressor stage's blade profile.,"In the compressor stage's blade profile, rotor velocity (denoted as U) plays a crucial role in determining the performance and efficiency of the compressor. The rotor velocity is the speed at which the rotor blades rotate, and it directly influences the tangential or whirl velocity of the air as it passes through the rotor.

1. **Work Input**: All the work input into the compressor stage is delivered through the rotor due to its rotation. The change in tangential velocity (whirl velocity) is a key factor in the work done by the compressor. The work done per unit mass flow rate (W) is calculated using the rotor velocity, as shown in the equation: 
   \[
   W = U \Delta V_w = U(C_{w2} - C_{w1}) = U C_a(\tan(\alpha_2) - \tan(\alpha_1))
   \]
   Here, ΔVw represents the change in whirl velocity, which is influenced by the rotor's rotational speed.

2. **Momentum Change**: The rotor velocity contributes to the rate of change of momentum of the air passing through the compressor. According to Newton's principles, the force acting on the rotor blade is related to the rate of change of momentum, which is directly affected by the rotor's speed.

3. **Power Absorption**: The power absorbed by the compressor stage is also dependent on rotor velocity. The power can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Power} = W \times m
   \]
   where m is the mass flow rate. A higher rotor velocity results in greater work done and, consequently, more power absorbed by the compressor.

4. **Velocity Triangles**: The rotor velocity is integral to constructing the velocity triangles at the blade mid-height. These triangles illustrate the relationships between the relative and absolute velocities of the air entering and leaving the rotor, which are essential for analyzing the compressor's performance.

In summary, rotor velocity is a fundamental parameter that affects the work input, momentum change, power absorption, and overall efficiency of the compressor stage in gas turbines. It is crucial for optimizing the compressor's design and performance."

These angles are associated with the flow of air through the rotor and stator components of the compressor.

1. **Relative Velocity (V)**: The relative velocity (V₁ and V₂) refers to the velocity of the air as seen from the rotating rotor. The angle β (β₁ for the inlet and β₂ for the outlet) represents the direction of this relative velocity vector concerning the vertical axis. The relative velocity is essential for understanding how effectively the rotor can impart energy to the airflow. 

2. **Absolute Velocity (C)**: The absolute velocity (C₁ and C₂) is the actual velocity of the air as it moves through the compressor, taking into account both the rotor's motion and the airflow direction. The angles α (α₁ for the inlet and α₂ for the outlet) indicate the direction of the absolute velocity vector. 

3. **Performance Implications**:
   - The relationship between the angles β and α affects the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw), which is critical for the work done by the compressor. The change in whirl velocity (ΔVw) is influenced by the difference in these angles: W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)).
   - A larger deflection (β₂ - β₁) indicates a greater change in the direction of airflow, which can enhance the energy transfer from the rotor to the air, thereby increasing the stage work absorbed by the compressor.
   - The efficiency of the compressor is also linked to these angles. For optimal performance, the angles should be designed to minimize losses due to diffusion and ensure that the airflow does not stall.

In summary, the angles of relative and absolute velocities (β and α) are integral to the compressor's design and operation, influencing the efficiency, power absorption, and overall performance of the compressor stage."

1. **Efficiency**: A constant axial velocity helps in optimizing the flow through the compressor stages, ensuring that the air is efficiently directed through the rotor and stator without stalling. This is crucial for maintaining the performance and efficiency of the compressor.

2. **Predictable Performance**: By keeping the axial velocity constant, the behavior of the airflow can be more easily predicted and modeled. This allows for better design and analysis of the compressor stages, leading to improved performance characteristics.

3. **Work Input Calculation**: The equations governing the work done by the compressor depend on the axial velocity. For instance, the work absorbed by the compressor stage is related to the change in tangential velocity, which is influenced by the constant axial velocity. This relationship simplifies the calculations for power requirements and overall performance.

4. **Uniform Flow Distribution**: A constant axial velocity helps in achieving a uniform flow distribution across the compressor blades, which is essential for minimizing losses due to turbulence and ensuring that the compressor operates smoothly.

5. **Reduction in Staging**: By increasing the stage work input while maintaining a constant axial velocity, it is possible to achieve a desired overall pressure ratio with fewer compressor stages. This can lead to a more compact and lighter design, which is beneficial in applications where space and weight are critical factors.

Overall, maintaining a constant axial velocity is fundamental to the effective design and operation of compressors in industrial gas turbines, contributing to their efficiency, performance, and reliability."

1. The change in whirl velocity is defined as the difference between the whirl velocities at the rotor inlet and outlet, given by:
   - Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) (whirl velocity at inlet)
   - Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂) (whirl velocity at outlet)

2. The work done per unit mass flow rate (W) is then expressed as:
   \[
   W = U \Delta Vw = U (Cw₂ - Cw₁) = U Ca (tan(α₂) - tan(α₁)) 
   \]
   where U is the blade velocity and ΔVw is the change in whirl velocity.

3. The power absorbed by the compressor stage can be calculated by multiplying the work done per unit mass flow rate by the mass flow rate (m):
   \[
   \text{Power} = W \times m
   \]

Additionally, the work can also be represented using rotor air angles (β₁ and β₂) as follows:
\[
W = U Ca (tan(β₁) - tan(β₂))
\]
This indicates that the work absorbed increases with the deflection of the air by the rotor, axial velocity, and blade velocity."

Specifically, the force acting on the rotor blade is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the air passing through the compressor stage. In the context of the compressor, as the air flows through the rotor, the change in momentum (which is the product of mass flow rate and change in velocity) results in a force being exerted on the rotor blades. Thus, the force can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Force} = \frac{\Delta \text{Momentum}}{\Delta t} \]

where \(\Delta \text{Momentum}\) is the change in momentum of the air, and \(\Delta t\) is the time over which this change occurs. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage, which is the product of the force and the blade velocity, is directly related to this change in momentum."

When represented in terms of the rotor air angles β₁ and β₂, the stage work \( W \) is given by the equation:

\[ W = U \, C_a \, (\tan(\beta_1) - \tan(\beta_2)) \]

where \( \beta_2 - \beta_1 \) represents the deflection of the air by the rotor. This formulation highlights how the stage work absorbed is influenced by the rotor air angles in addition to the blade velocity \( U \) and the axial velocity \( C_a \)."

Specifically, the greater the deflection of air (represented by the difference between the angles β₂ and β₁), the more the tangential or whirl velocity changes, which in turn increases the stage work input. This implies that a higher deflection leads to more efficient energy transfer from the rotor to the air, resulting in improved compressor performance. Additionally, a well-designed compressor stage with equal rotor and stator deflections can achieve a balanced reaction, optimizing the overall efficiency and reducing the number of stages needed to achieve a desired pressure ratio."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,61,5f0ba205577301c1945382b0e12fe6801eb50452099006a00c1e79ecea5f42c1,In what way does the diffusion in the rotor and stator affect the velocity vectors of air?,"The diffusion in the rotor and stator affects the velocity vectors of air by causing the velocity vector V₂ (the velocity of air leaving the rotor) to be less than the velocity vector V₁ (the velocity of air entering the rotor). Similarly, the absolute velocity vector C₂ (the absolute velocity of air leaving the rotor) is less than the absolute velocity vector C₁ (the absolute velocity of air entering the rotor). This reduction in velocity is a result of the diffusion process, which occurs due to the deflection of air by the rotor and stator. The greater the deflection of the rotor and stator, the more significant the diffusion, leading to a decrease in both the relative and absolute velocities of the air as it passes through the compressor stage."

This means that the amount of diffusion in the rotor and stator is balanced, leading to an equal distribution of work done by the rotor and stator on the airflow. Consequently, this design choice optimizes the efficiency of the compressor stage by ensuring that both components contribute equally to the overall performance."

According to the equations presented in the context, the work done per unit mass flow rate, denoted as W, is given by the formula:

\[ W = U \cdot Ca \cdot (\tan(\beta_1) - \tan(\beta_2)) \]

In this equation, \( U \) represents the blade velocity, \( Ca \) is the constant axial velocity, and \( \tan(\beta_1) \) and \( \tan(\beta_2) \) are the tangents of the angles related to the rotor's deflection. 

As the blade velocity \( U \) increases, the stage work absorbed \( W \) also increases, assuming that the other factors (like the axial velocity and the deflection angles) remain constant. This means that a higher blade velocity contributes to a greater change in whirl velocity, which in turn results in more work being done by the compressor stage. 

Furthermore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is calculated as:

\[ \text{Power} = W \times m \]

where \( m \) is the mass flow rate. Thus, an increase in blade velocity not only increases the stage work but also results in higher power absorption, making blade velocity a critical factor in the performance of a compressor."

As described in the context, the work done per unit mass flow rate (W) is given by the equation:

\[ W = U \Delta Vw = U (Cw₂ - Cw₁) \]

where \( Cw₁ \) and \( Cw₂ \) are the tangential velocities at the inlet and outlet of the rotor, respectively. The efficiency of a compressor is influenced by how effectively it converts the input energy into useful work, which is reflected in the change in tangential velocity.

When the change in tangential velocity (ΔVw) is greater, it indicates a more significant increase in the energy imparted to the air by the rotor. This can lead to higher stage work and, consequently, a higher overall efficiency, as more energy is effectively used to compress the air rather than being lost to other factors such as friction or turbulence.

Additionally, the relationship between the deflection angles (β₁ and β₂) and the tangential velocities shows that optimizing these angles can enhance the change in tangential velocity, further improving the compressor's efficiency. Therefore, a well-designed compressor that maximizes ΔVw while minimizing losses will exhibit better overall efficiency."

They illustrate how the air is deflected as it passes through the compressor, allowing for a clearer understanding of the dynamics at play.

1. **Deflection Visualization**: The combined velocity triangles show the angles of the velocities (V and C) at both the rotor and stator, highlighting the deflection of the airflow. This deflection is crucial for preventing stalling and ensuring efficient airflow through the compressor.

2. **Momentum Changes**: By depicting the relative and absolute velocities, the triangles help in analyzing the changes in momentum as air moves through the compressor.

This relationship is critical for understanding how changes in deflection and velocity impact the overall performance and efficiency of the compressor stage.

4. **Design Implications**: By analyzing the combined velocity triangles, engineers can determine the optimal design parameters for the blades, such as the angle of attack and blade profile, to maximize efficiency and minimize the number of stages required to achieve a desired pressure ratio.

Overall, the combined velocity triangles serve as a fundamental tool for analyzing and optimizing the performance of compressor stages in industrial gas turbines."

\[ W = U C_a (\tan(β₁) - \tan(β₂)) \]

This equation indicates that the work absorbed by the compressor stage is directly related to the difference in the tangents of these angles, which reflects the change in the tangential or whirl velocity of the air. A greater deflection (the difference between β₂ and β₁) leads to an increase in the work done by the compressor, as it indicates a larger change in momentum and thus a greater force acting on the rotor blades. Therefore, the angles β₁ and β₂ are crucial for calculating the efficiency and performance of the compressor stage."

This deflection is essential for maintaining the correct flow conditions and preventing flow separation, which can lead to stalling.

In the compressor stage, the air enters the rotor and is directed by the blade profile at an angle that is suitable for the stator. This design minimizes the risk of stalling by controlling the airflow and maintaining a stable velocity profile. The velocity triangles at blade mid-height illustrate the relationship between the relative and absolute velocities of the air, which are influenced by the blade angles (β₁ and α₁ for the inlet, and β₂ and α₂ for the outlet).

Additionally, the design assumes a constant axial velocity (Cₐ), which helps in managing the airflow through the compressor. By adjusting the convergence of the annulus and considering the increase in density due to rising pressure, the design can optimize the flow characteristics. The balance between the rotor and stator deflections, and the resulting diffusion in the rotor and stator, further contributes to maintaining stable airflow and preventing stalling. 

Overall, the blade profile's design ensures that the air is effectively managed throughout the compressor stage, allowing for efficient operation and reducing the likelihood of stalling."

All the work input into the compressor stage is delivered solely through the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, the work absorbed by the compressor stage is attributed to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity. Specifically, the change in whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) is directly related to the rotor's rotation, as it influences the tangential velocity components of the airflow.

The work done per unit mass flow rate (W) is expressed as:

\[ W = U \Delta V_w = U (Cw₂ - Cw₁) = U Ca (\tan(α₂) - \tan(α₁)) \]
