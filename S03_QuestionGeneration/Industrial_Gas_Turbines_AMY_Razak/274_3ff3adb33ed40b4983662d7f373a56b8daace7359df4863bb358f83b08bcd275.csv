Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant in this case and the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases due to fouling, the fuel flow increases. As a result, the fuel valve position also follows a similar trend to that shown in Figure 18.6. The increase in the temperature rise across the combustor and the approximately constant combustion inlet temperature, T₂, result in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

The decrease in the compressor airflow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. Similarly, the reduction in the turbine flow also results in a decrease in turbine power. The compressor efficiency decrease is due primarily to the effects of compressor fouling. Any reduction in the turbine efficiency is due to the decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed resulting from the increase in the turbine entry temperatures, as observed in Fig. 18.15. ",How do the trends in temperature compare when operating at the EGT limit versus the case described in the text?,"The trends in temperature are opposite, except for the compressor discharge temperature.","Except for the compressor discharge temperature, all other temperature trends are reversed compared to operating at the EGT limit.","Operating at the EGT limit shows opposite temperature trends to the described case, with the compressor discharge temperature being the exception.","The text notes that temperature trends are the opposite of those at the EGT limit, excluding the compressor discharge temperature.","In contrast to the EGT limit scenario, the described case exhibits reversed temperature trends, save for the compressor discharge temperature."

The compressor efficiency decrease is due primarily to the effects of compressor fouling. Any reduction in the turbine efficiency is due to the decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed resulting from the increase in the turbine entry temperatures, as observed in Fig. 18.15. ",How does the power output from the gas turbine behave in the described case of operating at low power?,The power output from the gas turbine remains constant despite the decrease in thermal efficiency due to fouling.,"Even with fouling reducing thermal efficiency, the gas turbine's power output stays constant.","The text states that the gas turbine maintains constant power output, although fouling lowers efficiency.","Despite the impact of fouling on efficiency, power output does not vary in the described low power operation.","Constant power output is achieved by the gas turbine, unaffected by the efficiency drop from fouling."
