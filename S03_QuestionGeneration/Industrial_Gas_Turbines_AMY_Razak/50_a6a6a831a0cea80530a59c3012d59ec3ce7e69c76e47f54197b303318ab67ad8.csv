where Wₙₑₜ is the net specific work, Wₜ is the total turbine work, Wc is the compressor work and Qₙₑₜ is the total heat input. As discussed, in an ideal regenerative reheat cycle Qₙₑₜ = Wₜ then:

ηₜₕ = 1 – Wᶜ                                                [3.13]

Therefore, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency will be a maximum when Wc/Qₙₑₜ is a minimum. For a given compressor pressure ratio, Wc/Qₙₑₜ is a minimum when Qₙₑₜ is a maximum, which occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal (i.e. when turbine pressure ratios are optimised for maximum specific work). Optimised (equal) turbine pressure ratios also result in T₃ = T₅ = T₇ (see Fig. ",How is thermal efficiency (ηₜₕ) defined in the context of the ideal regenerative reheat cycle?,ηₜₕ = 1 – Wᶜ/Qₙₑₜ.,"Thermal efficiency is calculated as one minus the ratio of compressor work to total heat input, ηₜₕ = 1 – Wᶜ/Qₙₑₜ.","In this cycle, ηₜₕ is defined by the equation ηₜₕ = 1 – Wᶜ/Qₙₑₜ, highlighting the impact of compressor work on efficiency.",The formula ηₜₕ = 1 – Wᶜ/Qₙₑₜ quantifies how compressor work relative to heat input affects efficiency.,"Efficiency ηₜₕ is derived as 1 minus the fraction of compressor work over total heat input, ηₜₕ = 1 – Wᶜ/Qₙₑₜ."

where Qs is the combustor heat input and cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure. Although there is a decrease in the combustor heat input, the additional heat input in the reheat chamber, Qr = cₚ(T₆ – T₅) needs to be accounted for. In spite of increased heat input due to reheat, the increased specific work results in an increase in thermal efficiency compared with the ideal simple cycle. The total heat input (Qₙₑₜ) is therefore:

Therefore,

Qₙₑₜ = cₚ(T₄ – T₇) + cₚ(T₆ – T₅)

Rearranging gives

Qₙₑₜ = cₚ(T₄ – T₅) + cₚ(T₆ – T₇) [3.12]

Equation 3.12 is the same as the total turbine work, irrespective of the HP and LP turbine pressure ratio split. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal. Therefore, when the turbine pressure ratio split is optimised for maximum work, the total heat input is also a maximum.

By considering the net work and heat transfers, we may derive an expression relating the thermal efficiency, ηth, with overall pressure ratio and temperature as follows:

ηth = Wnet / (Wt - Wc) = Qnet / Qnet
