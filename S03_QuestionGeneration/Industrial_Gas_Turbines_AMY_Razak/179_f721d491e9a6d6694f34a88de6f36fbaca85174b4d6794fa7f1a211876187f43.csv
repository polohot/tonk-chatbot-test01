The algorithm uses three components to adjust the control output:

1. **Proportional (P)**: This component produces an output that is proportional to the current error value. It provides a control output that is directly related to the magnitude of the error, helping to reduce the overall error.

2. **Integral (I)**: This component accumulates the error over time and integrates it. It addresses the residual steady-state error that may occur with the proportional control alone, ensuring that the process variable reaches and maintains the setpoint.

3. **Derivative (D)**: This component predicts future error based on its rate of change. It provides a control output that dampens the system's response, helping to reduce overshoot and improve stability.

In industrial applications, the PID controller adjusts the control inputs to a process (like temperature, pressure, or flow) based on the calculated output from these three components. This results in improved system performance, stability, and accuracy in maintaining the desired operational conditions. Tuning the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) is essential to optimize the controller's performance for specific applications."

1. **Proportional (P)**: This component produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. It helps to reduce the overall error by adjusting the control output based on the magnitude of the error.

2. **Integral (I)**: This component is concerned with the accumulation of past errors. It integrates the error over time and adjusts the control output to eliminate the residual steady-state error that may occur with a pure proportional controller.

3. **Derivative (D)**: This component predicts future error based on its rate of change. It provides a damping effect by responding to the speed at which the error is changing, helping to reduce overshoot and improve system stability.
