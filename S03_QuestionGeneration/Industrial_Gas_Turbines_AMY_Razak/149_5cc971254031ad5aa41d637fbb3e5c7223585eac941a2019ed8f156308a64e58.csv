For instance, if the compressor exit pressure is lower than expected, this will cause an increase in the non-dimensional flow into the turbine and a decrease in the entropy change during the turbine's expansion. Concurrently, the entropy change during compression will increase. These changes, when compared to the design values for flow and efficiencies, will result in an increase in the turbine fouling and efficiency fault index, while the compressor efficiency fault index will decrease. Such patterns in the fault indices can indicate the presence of instrumentation errors and may prompt the need for calibration."

Specifically, if the compressor exit pressure is reading lower than expected, it leads to an increase in the turbine fouling and efficiency fault index, while the compressor efficiency fault index decreases. This pattern indicates that as the turbine fouling increases due to the erroneous measurements, the efficiency of the compressor is negatively impacted, resulting in a lower compressor efficiency fault index."

Specifically, when there are instrumentation faults, such as an incorrect reading of the compressor exit pressure, it can lead to unexpected changes in the system's performance metrics. 

For instance, if the compressor exit pressure is reading lower than expected, it results in an increase in the non-dimensional flow into the turbine and a simultaneous increase in the entropy change during compression. This discrepancy from the expected design values suggests that the measurements being taken are not accurate, as the changes in entropy and flow dynamics do not align with the anticipated performance of the turbine and compressor.
