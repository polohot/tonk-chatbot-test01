Fault indices can also be used to detect measurement errors. When instrumentation faults are present, the values for the fault indices give rise to unreasonable values, especially where some inter-stage measurement is incorrect. For example, in a single-shaft gas turbine, if the compressor exit pressure is reading lower than expected, the non-dimensional flow into the turbine will increase while the entropy change during the expansion in the turbine will decrease. Also, the entropy change during compression will simultaneously increase. These changes, relative to the design values for flow and efficiencies, will result in an increase in the turbine fouling and efficiency fault index, while the compressor efficiency fault index decreases.
