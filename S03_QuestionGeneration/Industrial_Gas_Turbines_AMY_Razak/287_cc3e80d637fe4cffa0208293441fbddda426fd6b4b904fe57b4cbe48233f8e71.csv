Figure 18.38 shows the trends in the gas turbine and generator power outputs and thermal efficiency. The gas turbine and generator power outputs remain constant during this simulation as no engine operating limits are exceeded during hot end damage due to the low power demand from the gas turbine. The generator power output remains on the power set point of 35 MW. Although there is an increase in the compressor efficiency and pressure ratio, the loss in the turbine efficiency due to hot end damage results in a decrease in the thermal efficiency.
