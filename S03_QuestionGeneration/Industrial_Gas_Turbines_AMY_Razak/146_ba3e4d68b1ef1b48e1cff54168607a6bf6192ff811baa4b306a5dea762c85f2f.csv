They represent the percentage change from the undeteriorated characteristics of components such as compressors and turbines. 

For each component, two specific fault indices can be defined: the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. For instance, if a compressor is fouled, the fouling fault index might indicate a 3% reduction in the compressor's non-dimensional flow characteristic, while the efficiency fault index might show a 1% reduction in isentropic efficiency. Similarly, for turbines, corresponding indices can be established to reflect their deteriorated characteristics.

By utilizing these fault indices, engineers can detect changes in component performance and quantify the deterioration on a component-by-component basis. This process involves comparing measured data from the gas turbine with expected values derived from an engine model representing the undeteriorated state. If discrepancies arise, fault indices are applied to adjust the component characteristics until the measured and predicted data align. 

Ultimately, this iterative process allows for the identification of the specific fault indices for each component, enabling a comprehensive understanding of how performance deterioration impacts overall gas turbine efficiency and power output. Thus, fault indices play a critical role in performance monitoring and diagnostics within gas turbine systems."

These indices represent the percentage change from the undeteriorated characteristics of the components.

To utilize fault indices, the following steps are typically involved:

1. **Definition of Fault Indices**: Two specific fault indices are defined for each component: the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. These indices quantify the extent of performance deterioration. For example, a fouled compressor may have a fouling fault index of –3% and an efficiency fault index of –1%.

2. **Modeling the Undeteriorated State**: An engine model representing the undeteriorated gas turbine is created. This model can be a steady-state model that reflects the expected performance of the gas turbine under normal operating conditions.

3. **Comparison of Measured Data**: Measured performance data from the gas turbine is collected under current operating conditions. This data is then compared with the corresponding data predicted by the engine model.

4. **Adjustment of Component Characteristics**: If discrepancies are found between the measured data and the model predictions, fault indices are applied to adjust the component characteristics iteratively.
