It was stated at the beginning of this chapter that performance deterioration results from the change in component characteristics, namely compressors and turbines, as shown in Figs 9.3, 9.4 for compressors and Figs 9.11 and 9.12 for turbines. It was also stated that measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds are determined by the interaction of engine components and when performance deterioration occurs the change in these component characteristics results in the change in the measurable parameters, as summarised in Fig. 9.1. A performance-related fault can therefore be defined as a change in the component characteristic.

# 9.5.1 Fault indices

Fault indices are means of determining the deteriorated component characteristics. They represent the percentage change of the undeteriorated characteristic. Two fault indices can be defined for any component and they correspond to the fouling and efficiency fault index. For example, the fouled compressor flow characteristic, as shown in Fig. 9.3 is determined by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow for any given non-dimensional speed line by 3%, and the deteriorated compressor efficiency characteristic shown in Fig. 9.4 is obtained by reducing the compressor isentropic efficiency for any given speed line by 1%. Thus, for a fouled compressor, the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index is –3% and –1%, respectively, for this case.

Similarly, fault indices can be used to determine deteriorated turbine characteristics and these fault indices correspond to the turbine fouling fault index and turbine efficiency fault index. The deteriorated turbine characteristics shown in Figs 9.11 and 9.12 are obtained by applying a turbine fouling fault index of 3% and a turbine efficiency fault index of –1%, respectively.

# 9.5.2 Quantifying performance deterioration

Fault indices are quite powerful in quantifying performance deterioration as they provide a means of determining the deteriorated component characteristic. As a result, they also detect and quantify performance deterioration on a component by component basis. Thus, one of the objectives in performance monitoring and diagnostics is achieved by the use of fault indices. Since fault indices give us the deteriorated component characteristic, the engine model with deteriorated component characteristics can now be used to evaluate the loss in power output and increase in heat rate due to performance deterioration and therefore achieve the second objective of performance monitoring and diagnostics.

To determine fault indices, we need to be armed with an engine model representing the undeteriorated gas turbine that we wish to monitor. The model can be a steady-state model, built using the methods discussed in Chapter 7. In this event the measured data should also correspond to steady-state conditions. This can be achieved by filtering the measured data as done by Teukolsky et al.9 and by Dole.10 The engine model is run at the current operating conditions of the gas turbine and the measured data is compared with corresponding data determined by the model (expected or predicted measured values). If they do not match, fault indices are used to alter the component characteristics until they match. At the end of this iterative or implicit process, all the component fault indices are determined. This process for a single-shaft gas turbine is summarised in Fig. ",What are the two main types of fault indices mentioned for gas turbine components?,The two main types are the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index.,Fouling fault index and efficiency fault index are the two main types discussed.,"For gas turbine components, the primary fault indices are fouling and efficiency.",Two key fault indices: one for fouling and another for efficiency.,The text specifies fouling and efficiency as the main fault indices for components.

For example, the fouled compressor flow characteristic, as shown in Fig. 9.3 is determined by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow for any given non-dimensional speed line by 3%, and the deteriorated compressor efficiency characteristic shown in Fig. 9.4 is obtained by reducing the compressor isentropic efficiency for any given speed line by 1%. Thus, for a fouled compressor, the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index is –3% and –1%, respectively, for this case.

Similarly, fault indices can be used to determine deteriorated turbine characteristics and these fault indices correspond to the turbine fouling fault index and turbine efficiency fault index. The deteriorated turbine characteristics shown in Figs 9.11 and 9.12 are obtained by applying a turbine fouling fault index of 3% and a turbine efficiency fault index of –1%, respectively.

# 9.5.2 Quantifying performance deterioration

Fault indices are quite powerful in quantifying performance deterioration as they provide a means of determining the deteriorated component characteristic. As a result, they also detect and quantify performance deterioration on a component by component basis. Thus, one of the objectives in performance monitoring and diagnostics is achieved by the use of fault indices. Since fault indices give us the deteriorated component characteristic, the engine model with deteriorated component characteristics can now be used to evaluate the loss in power output and increase in heat rate due to performance deterioration and therefore achieve the second objective of performance monitoring and diagnostics.

To determine fault indices, we need to be armed with an engine model representing the undeteriorated gas turbine that we wish to monitor. The model can be a steady-state model, built using the methods discussed in Chapter 7. In this event the measured data should also correspond to steady-state conditions. This can be achieved by filtering the measured data as done by Teukolsky et al.9 and by Dole.10 The engine model is run at the current operating conditions of the gas turbine and the measured data is compared with corresponding data determined by the model (expected or predicted measured values). If they do not match, fault indices are used to alter the component characteristics until they match. At the end of this iterative or implicit process, all the component fault indices are determined. This process for a single-shaft gas turbine is summarised in Fig. ",What is the significance of steady-state conditions in determining fault indices?,Steady-state conditions ensure that the model and measured data are comparable for accurate fault index determination.,They provide a consistent basis for comparing model predictions with actual measurements.,Steady-state data is crucial for aligning the engine model with real-world operational data.,Achieving steady-state allows for the precise application of fault indices to match model and measured values.,The text highlights steady-state conditions as essential for reliable fault index calculation.

It was stated at the beginning of this chapter that performance deterioration results from the change in component characteristics, namely compressors and turbines, as shown in Figs 9.3, 9.4 for compressors and Figs 9.11 and 9.12 for turbines. It was also stated that measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds are determined by the interaction of engine components and when performance deterioration occurs the change in these component characteristics results in the change in the measurable parameters, as summarised in Fig. 9.1. A performance-related fault can therefore be defined as a change in the component characteristic.

# 9.5.1 Fault indices

Fault indices are means of determining the deteriorated component characteristics. They represent the percentage change of the undeteriorated characteristic. Two fault indices can be defined for any component and they correspond to the fouling and efficiency fault index. For example, the fouled compressor flow characteristic, as shown in Fig. 9.3 is determined by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow for any given non-dimensional speed line by 3%, and the deteriorated compressor efficiency characteristic shown in Fig. 9.4 is obtained by reducing the compressor isentropic efficiency for any given speed line by 1%. Thus, for a fouled compressor, the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index is –3% and –1%, respectively, for this case.

Similarly, fault indices can be used to determine deteriorated turbine characteristics and these fault indices correspond to the turbine fouling fault index and turbine efficiency fault index. The deteriorated turbine characteristics shown in Figs 9.11 and 9.12 are obtained by applying a turbine fouling fault index of 3% and a turbine efficiency fault index of –1%, respectively.
