Since the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio is fixed, from Equation 2.20, the specific work output from the gas turbine cycle will also remain constant.

# 17.1.2 Trends in power and efficiency

As the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, remains constant during this transient, the compressor air flow rate decreases proportionally with the ambient pressure. Since the specific work does not change with ambient pressure, a decrease in air flow rate results in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine and thus from the generator. This can be seen in

Fig. 17.2, which shows the trends in power output from the gas turbine and the generator. As the thermal efficiency is dependent largely on the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, and as these parameters remain constant during this transient, the thermal efficiency

Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

of the gas turbine also remains nearly constant during this transient. This can be seen in Fig. 17.2, which also shows the trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine during this transient. The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is due primarily to the slight increase in specific humidity as the ambient pressure decreases.

Since the compressor pressure ratio and consequently the turbine pressure ratio remain constant, the power associated with these components also decreases due to the reduction in mass flow rate through these components. This can be seen in Fig. 17.3, which shows the trends in the powers associated with the compressor and turbine. As the operating points on the compressor and turbine characteristics do not change very much, their efficiencies also remain constant during this transient as shown in Fig. 17.3.

# 17.1.3 Trends in pressure

The constant pressure ratios that prevail in the compressor and turbine result in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and in the turbine inlet pressure. The decrease in these pressures is proportional to the decrease in the ambient pressure during this transient, as shown in Fig. 17.4. The figure also shows the trends in compressor inlet pressure and the turbine exit pressure. The decrease in these pressures is due to the introduction of the ambient pressure transient.

Figure 17.5 shows the trend in turbine creep life usage during this transient. It has been stated that the ambient temperature does not change during this transient and therefore the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and the turbine cooling air temperature, T₂, remain constant. Thus the turbine blade metal

temperature also remains constant during this transient. Since the gas turbine speed is constant, the radial stress will not vary. However, we see that the turbine power output decreases due to the reduction in the mass flow rate through the turbine. This results in a decrease in stress in the turbine blade material due to the reduced torque. The consequent reduction in the stress and the constant blade metal temperature result in a slight decrease in the turbine creep life usage as illustrated in Fig. 17.5, which shows the trend in the turbine creep life usage as time to next overhaul.

# 17.1.5 Trends in flow

The reduction in the mass flow rate due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.6. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel flow rate during this transient. Since the power output from the gas turbine decreases and the thermal efficiency remains approximately constant, the fuel flow decreases. Consequently, the fuel valve position also decreases due to the reduction in fuel flow. Since the temperature rise across the combustor remains constant, the air–fuel ratio also remains constant, as shown in Fig. 17.6.

# 17.2 Trends in power output and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

Fig. 17.2, which shows the trends in power output from the gas turbine and the generator. As the thermal efficiency is dependent largely on the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, and as these parameters remain constant during this transient, the thermal efficiency

Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

of the gas turbine also remains nearly constant during this transient. This can be seen in Fig. 17.2, which also shows the trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine during this transient. The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is due primarily to the slight increase in specific humidity as the ambient pressure decreases.

Since the compressor pressure ratio and consequently the turbine pressure ratio remain constant, the power associated with these components also decreases due to the reduction in mass flow rate through these components. This can be seen in Fig. 17.3, which shows the trends in the powers associated with the compressor and turbine. As the operating points on the compressor and turbine characteristics do not change very much, their efficiencies also remain constant during this transient as shown in Fig. 17.3.

# 17.1.3 Trends in pressure

The constant pressure ratios that prevail in the compressor and turbine result in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and in the turbine inlet pressure. The decrease in these pressures is proportional to the decrease in the ambient pressure during this transient, as shown in Fig. 17.4. The figure also shows the trends in compressor inlet pressure and the turbine exit pressure. The decrease in these pressures is due to the introduction of the ambient pressure transient.

# 17.1.4 Trends in creep life

Figure 17.5 shows the trend in turbine creep life usage during this transient. It has been stated that the ambient temperature does not change during this transient and therefore the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and the turbine cooling air temperature, T₂, remain constant. Thus the turbine blade metal

temperature also remains constant during this transient. Since the gas turbine speed is constant, the radial stress will not vary. However, we see that the turbine power output decreases due to the reduction in the mass flow rate through the turbine. This results in a decrease in stress in the turbine blade material due to the reduced torque. The consequent reduction in the stress and the constant blade metal temperature result in a slight decrease in the turbine creep life usage as illustrated in Fig. 17.5, which shows the trend in the turbine creep life usage as time to next overhaul.

# 17.1.5 Trends in flow

The reduction in the mass flow rate due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.6. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel flow rate during this transient. Since the power output from the gas turbine decreases and the thermal efficiency remains approximately constant, the fuel flow decreases. Consequently, the fuel valve position also decreases due to the reduction in fuel flow. Since the temperature rise across the combustor remains constant, the air–fuel ratio also remains constant, as shown in Fig. 17.6.

Since the compressor pressure ratio and consequently the turbine pressure ratio remain constant, the power associated with these components also decreases due to the reduction in mass flow rate through these components. This can be seen in Fig. 17.3, which shows the trends in the powers associated with the compressor and turbine. As the operating points on the compressor and turbine characteristics do not change very much, their efficiencies also remain constant during this transient as shown in Fig. 17.3.

# 17.1.3 Trends in pressure

The constant pressure ratios that prevail in the compressor and turbine result in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and in the turbine inlet pressure. The decrease in these pressures is proportional to the decrease in the ambient pressure during this transient, as shown in Fig. 17.4. The figure also shows the trends in compressor inlet pressure and the turbine exit pressure. The decrease in these pressures is due to the introduction of the ambient pressure transient.

# 17.1.4 Trends in creep life

Figure 17.5 shows the trend in turbine creep life usage during this transient. It has been stated that the ambient temperature does not change during this transient and therefore the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and the turbine cooling air temperature, T₂, remain constant. Thus the turbine blade metal

temperature also remains constant during this transient. Since the gas turbine speed is constant, the radial stress will not vary. However, we see that the turbine power output decreases due to the reduction in the mass flow rate through the turbine. This results in a decrease in stress in the turbine blade material due to the reduced torque. The consequent reduction in the stress and the constant blade metal temperature result in a slight decrease in the turbine creep life usage as illustrated in Fig. 17.5, which shows the trend in the turbine creep life usage as time to next overhaul.

# 17.1.5 Trends in flow

The reduction in the mass flow rate due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.6. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel flow rate during this transient. Since the power output from the gas turbine decreases and the thermal efficiency remains approximately constant, the fuel flow decreases. Consequently, the fuel valve position also decreases due to the reduction in fuel flow. Since the temperature rise across the combustor remains constant, the air–fuel ratio also remains constant, as shown in Fig. 17.6.

# 17.5 Trend in turbine creep life usage during ambient pressure transient.

# 17.1.4 Trends in creep life

Figure 17.5 shows the trend in turbine creep life usage during this transient. It has been stated that the ambient temperature does not change during this transient and therefore the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and the turbine cooling air temperature, T₂, remain constant. Thus the turbine blade metal

Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

temperature also remains constant during this transient. Since the gas turbine speed is constant, the radial stress will not vary. However, we see that the turbine power output decreases due to the reduction in the mass flow rate through the turbine. This results in a decrease in stress in the turbine blade material due to the reduced torque. The consequent reduction in the stress and the constant blade metal temperature result in a slight decrease in the turbine creep life usage as illustrated in Fig. 17.5, which shows the trend in the turbine creep life usage as time to next overhaul.

# 17.1.5 Trends in flow

The reduction in the mass flow rate due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.6. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel flow rate during this transient. Since the power output from the gas turbine decreases and the thermal efficiency remains approximately constant, the fuel flow decreases. Consequently, the fuel valve position also decreases due to the reduction in fuel flow. Since the temperature rise across the combustor remains constant, the air–fuel ratio also remains constant, as shown in Fig. 17.6.
