# 16.3 Effect of ambient temperature on engine performance at low power

The effect of varying the ambient temperature has been considered when the gas turbine is always on an engine limit, which would be encountered at high power operating conditions. The same ambient temperature transient is now considered but at lower power such that the engine never reaches an engine-limiting condition. This is achieved by setting the power demand from the generator to 30 MW. Again, the pressure is maintained at 1.013 Bar, the inlet and exhaust losses at 100 mm water gauge and relative humidity at 60%.

# 16.3.1 Trends in temperature and pressure ratio

Since no engine limit is reached or exceeded during this ambient temperature transient, the power output remains constant. The increased mass flow rate at lower ambient temperatures leads to a reduction in specific work due to maintaining the required (constant) power output from the generator. Thus a reduction in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, occurs in

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

In order to reduce the specific work, (in the period of constant VIGV operation) as seen in Figure 16.16. The reduction in T₁ and T₃/T₁ will result in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃. Since the turbine pressure ratio increases (to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine), the decrease in T₃ results in a decrease in EGT. This is shown in Fig. 16.17, which displays the trends in temperature during this ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.1 Trends in EGT

During this transient, the decrease in EGT is significantly large such that it decreases below the EGT limit of 650 K, which is the set point for VIGV control. The VIGV control system responds by closing the VIGV so that the EGT remains at its set point of 650 K as shown in Fig. 16.17. Thus, during the period when the VIGV is closing, the EGT remains constant. The closure of the VIGV, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁), will reduce the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, (W₁√T₁/P₁). For a given T₃/T₁, the reduction in W₁√T₁/P₁ requires a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.1 (Chapter 8). Although the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature is decreasing, and therefore resulting in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, the closure of the VIGV is sufficient to reduce the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, resulting in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility equation. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio also results in a reduction in turbine pressure ratio. Since the EGT remains constant during the period of VIGV operation, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Thus the trend in T₃ shows a small decrease, as shown in Fig. ",What happens to the turbine non-dimensional speed when the power output limit operates?,The turbine non-dimensional speed increases when the power output limit operates.,"During the operation of the power output limit, there is an increase in the turbine's non-dimensional speed.",An increase in turbine non-dimensional speed is observed as the power output limit comes into effect.,The operation of the power output limit leads to an increase in the turbine's non-dimensional speed.,"When the power output limit is active, the turbine non-dimensional speed rises."

In order to reduce the specific work, (in the period of constant VIGV operation) as seen in Figure 16.16. The reduction in T₁ and T₃/T₁ will result in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃. Since the turbine pressure ratio increases (to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine), the decrease in T₃ results in a decrease in EGT. This is shown in Fig. 16.17, which displays the trends in temperature during this ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.1 Trends in EGT

During this transient, the decrease in EGT is significantly large such that it decreases below the EGT limit of 650 K, which is the set point for VIGV control. The VIGV control system responds by closing the VIGV so that the EGT remains at its set point of 650 K as shown in Fig. 16.17. Thus, during the period when the VIGV is closing, the EGT remains constant. The closure of the VIGV, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁), will reduce the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, (W₁√T₁/P₁). For a given T₃/T₁, the reduction in W₁√T₁/P₁ requires a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.1 (Chapter 8). Although the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature is decreasing, and therefore resulting in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, the closure of the VIGV is sufficient to reduce the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, resulting in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility equation. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio also results in a reduction in turbine pressure ratio. Since the EGT remains constant during the period of VIGV operation, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Thus the trend in T₃ shows a small decrease, as shown in Fig. ",What is the consequence of the decrease in T₃/T₁ on turbine entry temperature?,"A decrease in T₃/T₁ results in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃.","The reduction of T₃/T₁ leads to a lower turbine entry temperature, T₃.","Turbine entry temperature, T₃, falls as a consequence of the decrease in T₃/T₁.","The decline in T₃/T₁ causes the turbine entry temperature, T₃, to decrease.","When T₃/T₁ decreases, it directly results in a reduction of the turbine entry temperature, T₃."

# 16.3 Effect of ambient temperature on engine performance at low power

The effect of varying the ambient temperature has been considered when the gas turbine is always on an engine limit, which would be encountered at high power operating conditions. The same ambient temperature transient is now considered but at lower power such that the engine never reaches an engine-limiting condition. This is achieved by setting the power demand from the generator to 30 MW. Again, the pressure is maintained at 1.013 Bar, the inlet and exhaust losses at 100 mm water gauge and relative humidity at 60%.

The increased mass flow rate at lower ambient temperatures leads to a reduction in specific work due to maintaining the required (constant) power output from the generator. Thus a reduction in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, occurs in
