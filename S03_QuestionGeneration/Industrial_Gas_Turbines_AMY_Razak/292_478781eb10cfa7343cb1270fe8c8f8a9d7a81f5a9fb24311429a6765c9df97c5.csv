# Power augmentation by increasing VIGV angle

Some manufacturers of single-shaft gas turbines offer a modification, where the VIGV angle may be increased by a small amount. Such modifications to the VIGV angle will increase the compressor flow rate and thus the power output from the gas turbine. However, this increase in power output is possible

19.5 Change in CO₂ emissions due to effect of peak rating. only when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, which normally occurs at high ambient temperatures. Opening of the VIGV angle could reduce the surge margin as shown in Fig. 16.21 (Chapter 16) and the maximum power limit of the gas turbine may have to be reduced, therefore decreasing the compressor pressure ratio to ensure a satisfactory compressor surge margin when operating at low ambient temperatures. Thus, at low ambient temperatures when the power output is limited, there may be a penalty paid in engine performance. Power augmentation by increasing the VIGV angle is simulated by increasing the compressor fouling fault index by 3%.

The increase in the compressor mass flow rate and thus the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV result in a higher compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine, as shown in Fig. 19.6. To maintain the compressor pressure ratio at or below the base rating case, and to ensure adequate compressor surge margin at low ambient temperatures, the maximum power limit is reduced to about 42MW, as can be seen in Fig. 19.7. There is a useful increase in the power output from the gas turbine of about 3.5% at high ambient temperatures, but at low ambient temperatures there is a substantial decrease in the power output of about 10%. It has been assumed that the maximum compressor pressure ratio is near or just below the base rating case at low ambient temperatures. However, if the opening of the VIGV erodes the surge margin significantly, the compressor pressure ratio must be decreased further at low ambient temperatures to ensure a satisfactory compressor surge margin. This will require a further reduction in the maximum power limit.

19.7 Change in gas turbine power output due to effect of increasing the VIGV angle.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio at high ambient temperatures also results in an improvement in the gas turbine thermal efficiency due to the increase in the VIGV position. But, at low ambient temperatures, when the engine is operating at the maximum power limit, the turbine entry temperature decreases due to the reduced gas turbine maximum power limit. Thus there is a reduction in the maximum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, relative.

Power augmentation to the base case, which results in a noticeable decrease in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 19.8.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is EGT limited, the increase in power output from the gas turbine is due largely to the increase in the air flow rate through the engine, due to the increase in the VIGV angle. Thus, there is only a slight increase in the temperature entry temperature, and hence in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the increase in turbine power results in an increase of the torque in the turbine blade material and this raises stresses in the turbine blade material. The increased turbine metal temperature and stress result in a small increase in the turbine creep life usage at higher ambient temperatures as shown in Fig. 19.9. At low ambient temperatures, the decrease in the gas turbine power output and reduced turbine entry temperature result in a substantial decrease in the turbine creep life usage. Thus there will be no need to increase the mean time between overhauls due to the increase in turbine creep life usage at high ambient temperature. In fact, it could be argued that the EGT limit should be increased to compensate for the significant decrease in creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. Such an increase in the EGT limit will augment the gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency further at high ambient temperatures, resulting in increased production and reduced fuel costs.

The increase in the VIGV angle results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio at high ambient temperature when the gas turbine power output is limited by the EGT. This results in an increase in the combustion pressure. The increase in the combustion pressure increases the NOx emissions, while

There is a useful increase in the power output from the gas turbine of about 3.5% at high ambient temperatures, but at low ambient temperatures there is a substantial decrease in the power output of about 10%. It has been assumed that the maximum compressor pressure ratio is near or just below the base rating case at low ambient temperatures. However, if the opening of the VIGV erodes the surge margin significantly, the compressor pressure ratio must be decreased further at low ambient temperatures to ensure a satisfactory compressor surge margin. This will require a further reduction in the maximum power limit.

19.7 Change in gas turbine power output due to effect of increasing the VIGV angle.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio at high ambient temperatures also results in an improvement in the gas turbine thermal efficiency due to the increase in the VIGV position. But, at low ambient temperatures, when the engine is operating at the maximum power limit, the turbine entry temperature decreases due to the reduced gas turbine maximum power limit. Thus there is a reduction in the maximum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, relative.

Power augmentation to the base case, which results in a noticeable decrease in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 19.8.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is EGT limited, the increase in power output from the gas turbine is due largely to the increase in the air flow rate through the engine, due to the increase in the VIGV angle. Thus, there is only a slight increase in the temperature entry temperature, and hence in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the increase in turbine power results in an increase of the torque in the turbine blade material and this raises stresses in the turbine blade material. The increased turbine metal temperature and stress result in a small increase in the turbine creep life usage at higher ambient temperatures as shown in Fig. 19.9. At low ambient temperatures, the decrease in the gas turbine power output and reduced turbine entry temperature result in a substantial decrease in the turbine creep life usage. Thus there will be no need to increase the mean time between overhauls due to the increase in turbine creep life usage at high ambient temperature. In fact, it could be argued that the EGT limit should be increased to compensate for the significant decrease in creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. Such an increase in the EGT limit will augment the gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency further at high ambient temperatures, resulting in increased production and reduced fuel costs.

The increase in the VIGV angle results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio at high ambient temperature when the gas turbine power output is limited by the EGT. This results in an increase in the combustion pressure. The increase in the combustion pressure increases the NOx emissions, while

# Power augmentation by increasing VIGV angle

Some manufacturers of single-shaft gas turbines offer a modification, where the VIGV angle may be increased by a small amount. Such modifications to the VIGV angle will increase the compressor flow rate and thus the power output from the gas turbine. However, this increase in power output is possible

19.5 Change in CO₂ emissions due to effect of peak rating. only when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, which normally occurs at high ambient temperatures. Opening of the VIGV angle could reduce the surge margin as shown in Fig. 16.21 (Chapter 16) and the maximum power limit of the gas turbine may have to be reduced, therefore decreasing the compressor pressure ratio to ensure a satisfactory compressor surge margin when operating at low ambient temperatures. Thus, at low ambient temperatures when the power output is limited, there may be a penalty paid in engine performance. Power augmentation by increasing the VIGV angle is simulated by increasing the compressor fouling fault index by 3%.

The increase in the compressor mass flow rate and thus the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV result in a higher compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine, as shown in Fig. 19.6. To maintain the compressor pressure ratio at or below the base rating case, and to ensure adequate compressor surge margin at low ambient temperatures, the maximum power limit is reduced to about 42MW, as can be seen in Fig. 19.7. There is a useful increase in the power output from the gas turbine of about 3.5% at high ambient temperatures, but at low ambient temperatures there is a substantial decrease in the power output of about 10%. It has been assumed that the maximum compressor pressure ratio is near or just below the base rating case at low ambient temperatures. However, if the opening of the VIGV erodes the surge margin significantly, the compressor pressure ratio must be decreased further at low ambient temperatures to ensure a satisfactory compressor surge margin. This will require a further reduction in the maximum power limit.

19.7 Change in gas turbine power output due to effect of increasing the VIGV angle.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio at high ambient temperatures also results in an improvement in the gas turbine thermal efficiency due to the increase in the VIGV position. But, at low ambient temperatures, when the engine is operating at the maximum power limit, the turbine entry temperature decreases due to the reduced gas turbine maximum power limit. Thus there is a reduction in the maximum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, relative.

Power augmentation to the base case, which results in a noticeable decrease in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 19.8.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is EGT limited, the increase in power output from the gas turbine is due largely to the increase in the air flow rate through the engine, due to the increase in the VIGV angle. Thus, there is only a slight increase in the temperature entry temperature, and hence in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the increase in turbine power results in an increase of the torque in the turbine blade material and this raises stresses in the turbine blade material. The increased turbine metal temperature and stress result in a small increase in the turbine creep life usage at higher ambient temperatures as shown in Fig. 19.9. At low ambient temperatures, the decrease in the gas turbine power output and reduced turbine entry temperature result in a substantial decrease in the turbine creep life usage. Thus there will be no need to increase the mean time between overhauls due to the increase in turbine creep life usage at high ambient temperature. In fact, it could be argued that the EGT limit should be increased to compensate for the significant decrease in creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. Such an increase in the EGT limit will augment the gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency further at high ambient temperatures, resulting in increased production and reduced fuel costs.

The increase in the VIGV angle results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio at high ambient temperature when the gas turbine power output is limited by the EGT. This results in an increase in the combustion pressure. The increase in the combustion pressure increases the NOx emissions, while
