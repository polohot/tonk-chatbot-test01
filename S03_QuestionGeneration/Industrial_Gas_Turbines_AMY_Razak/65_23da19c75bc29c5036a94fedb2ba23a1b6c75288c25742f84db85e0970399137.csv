The layer prevents the air exit angle from reaching the blade exit angle, thus the deviation δ will not be zero. The growth of the boundary layer depends on the blade incidence, i. The larger the incidence, the greater is the boundary layer growth and this results in an increased amount of diffusion and loss, as illustrated by Fig. 4.11, which shows the profile loss varying with incidence. The profile loss manifests itself as a loss in compressor stage efficiency.

As the incidence continues to increase, the blade will eventually stall (i.e. the boundary layer will separate) and this results in a rapid increase in profile loss and deviation as illustrated in Figs 4.11 and 4.12, respectively. At negative incidence, flow increases through the stage resulting in increased profile loss. At very high flows, the inlet Mach number increases (above the critical Mach number) and the losses increase appreciably due to shock loss and are often referred to as negative shock stall. In addition, at high Mach numbers the compressor inlet will choke, restricting the flow in this part of the characteristic (see Fig. 4.9). ",What effect does air viscosity have on the boundary layer along the blade in gas turbines?,"Air viscosity causes the growth of a boundary layer along the blade, preventing the air exit angle from matching the blade exit angle, leading to a non-zero deviation δ.","Due to air's viscous nature, a boundary layer develops on the blade, which affects the air exit angle and introduces deviation δ.","The viscous property of air results in boundary layer growth along the blade, impacting the stage's efficiency by causing deviation δ.","In gas turbines, the viscosity of air leads to boundary layer formation on blades, which hinders the air exit angle from aligning with the blade exit angle, creating deviation.","Boundary layer growth along the blade, caused by air viscosity, prevents the air exit angle from reaching the blade exit angle, resulting in deviation δ and efficiency loss."
