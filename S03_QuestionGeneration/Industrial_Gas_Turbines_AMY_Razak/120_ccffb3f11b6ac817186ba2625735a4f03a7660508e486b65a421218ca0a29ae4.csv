# 7.8.3 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing intercooling, regeneration and reheat

To predict the off-design performance of an intercooled–regenerative–reheat gas turbine an additional estimate is required to that described in Section 7.8.2 where the performance of the intercooled regenerative gas turbine was considered. This corresponds to the HP turbine pressure ratio, P₆/P₇, as shown in Fig. 7.11, which shows a schematic representation of an intercooled–regenerative–reheat gas turbine. It is also necessary to specify the reheat exit temperature, which also corresponds with the LP turbine entry temperature, T₈. The estimated vector data are:

1. compressor inlet mass flow, W₁
2. LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁
3. HP compressor inlet temperature, T₃

# 7.9 Off-design prediction of a two-shaft gas turbine using a free power turbine and employing intercooling, regeneration and reheat

The method applied to predict the off-design performance of a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine (Section 7.3) may be modified to include intercooling, regeneration and reheating. Three more estimates need to be added, which correspond to the intercooler exit temperature (i.e. ",How does the LP compressor pressure ratio (P2/P1) influence the performance of an intercooled gas turbine according to 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,The LP compressor pressure ratio (P2/P1) affects the compressor's efficiency and the overall cycle performance by determining the pressure increase before intercooling.,P2/P1 is critical in setting the stage for intercooling efficiency and impacts the turbine's overall thermal efficiency.,"According to the book, P2/P1 plays a key role in optimizing the intercooling process and enhancing cycle performance.",This pressure ratio influences the effectiveness of intercooling and the gas turbine's energy efficiency.,"P2/P1 is a determinant factor in the intercooled gas turbine's performance, affecting both intercooling and overall efficiency."
