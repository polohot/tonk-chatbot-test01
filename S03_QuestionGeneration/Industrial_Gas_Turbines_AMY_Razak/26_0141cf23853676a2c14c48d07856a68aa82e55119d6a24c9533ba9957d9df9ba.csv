# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

The temperature of 1400 K is also shown and is likely to be found in existing gas turbines. The ideal cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparison. Unlike the ideal cycle case, the thermal efficiency initially increases with pressure ratio and then decreases as the pressure ratio is further increased. The thermal efficiency therefore peaks and the peak thermal efficiency, and the pressure ratio at which it occurs, also increase with T₃. For example, when T₃ equals 700 K, the peak efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 4 and corresponds to about 15%. At a T₃ value of 900 K, the peak thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8 and the peak thermal efficiency is about 24%.

Simple gas turbine thermal efficiency varying with pressure ratio.

The temperature of 1400 K is also shown and is likely to be found in existing gas turbines. The ideal cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparison. Unlike the ideal cycle case, the thermal efficiency initially increases with pressure ratio and then decreases as the pressure ratio is further increased. The thermal efficiency therefore peaks and the peak thermal efficiency, and the pressure ratio at which it occurs, also increase with T₃. For example, when T₃ equals 700 K, the peak efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 4 and corresponds to about 15%. At a T₃ value of 900 K, the peak thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8 and the peak thermal efficiency is about 24%.

Although the specific work of an ideal cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, the effect of irreversibility is to reduce the specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 2.20. ",What effect does irreversibility have on the specific work of a gas turbine cycle?,Irreversibility reduces the specific work of a gas turbine cycle compared to an ideal cycle.,"The specific work is decreased by irreversibility in a gas turbine cycle, making it less than that of an ideal cycle.","Due to irreversibility, the specific work in a gas turbine cycle is lower than in an ideal scenario.",Irreversibility causes a reduction in the specific work achievable in a gas turbine cycle.,The presence of irreversibility means the specific work of a gas turbine cycle is less than it would be in an ideal cycle.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

Three values of T3 varying from 700 K to 900 K, enable comparison of the performance with the ideal simple cycle as discussed in Section 2.6. The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a maximum cycle
