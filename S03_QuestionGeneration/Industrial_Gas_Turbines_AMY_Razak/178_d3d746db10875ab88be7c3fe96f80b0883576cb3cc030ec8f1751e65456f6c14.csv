Many such methods have been developed, from simple Euler to more advanced methods such as Rung–Kutta–Felberg and Gears methods.

Rung–Kutta–Felberg and Euler are referred to as the single-step methods because the current solutions and rates of change only are required to determine the solution at the next (time) step. Gears, on the other hand, requires previous solutions and rates of change and is known as a multi-step or predictor–corrector method. This method is generally more efficient compared with Rung–Kutta–Felberg, as fewer coefficients are needed to determine the next solution. However, single-step methods such as Rung–Kutta–Felberg are initially invoked to generate the necessary past solutions and rates of change before switching to multi-step methods. In this case, multi-step methods can be employed directly because steady-state conditions are always in place at the start. In this situation the previous solutions can be conveniently set to the current values and the previous rates of change set to zero.

Numerical methods have drawbacks where the solutions become unstable. For example, Euler would require very small time steps to achieve stable solutions and is rarely used. Rung–Kutta–Felberg and Gears can achieve stable solutions using larger steps and are therefore more efficient. Gears method is particularly suited because it is capable of overcoming a particular type of numerical instability referred to as stiff equations. Such instabilities occur when the general solution contains an exponential term such as *Cebx where b > 0 with initial conditions C = 0, but the rounding off errors in the numerical computation produces a solution in which C &lt;&gt; 0*.
