# 17.3.1 Compressor characteristics and trends in pressure and temperature ratios

As the ambient pressure decreases and the VIGV remains fully opened, it is observed that the air flow rate through the engine decreases (Section 17.2.4). This results in an increase in specific work to compensate for the loss in air flow rate in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine. The increase in specific work is achieved by increasing the turbine entry temperature, T₃, thus increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. The increase in turbine entry temperature also increases

The change in the compressor characteristic due to the opening of the VIGV is shown in Fig. 17.17. The resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow increases the compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility, as indicated by the operating points on the compressor characteristic.
