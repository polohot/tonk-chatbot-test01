The gas turbine simulator is a part of a combined-cycle power plant. If the stack temperature is limited to 120 degrees Celsius and the steam plant thermal efficiency is 32%, estimate the maximum combined-cycle thermal efficiency and power output. The ambient temperature and pressure are 15 degrees Celsius and 1.013 Bar at site conditions. ",How does the optimised power turbine capacity change when the relative humidity decreases from 60% to 20% at an ambient temperature of 35 degrees Celsius?,"The optimised power turbine capacity increases as the relative humidity decreases from 60% to 20%, due to the reduced air density and cooling load requirements.","Decreasing the relative humidity to 20% at 35 degrees Celsius enhances the turbine's performance, leading to a higher optimised capacity compared to 60% humidity.","At 20% relative humidity, the cooling load is lower, allowing for an increase in the optimised power turbine capacity over the 60% humidity scenario.","The optimised capacity is greater at 20% relative humidity than at 60%, because the lower humidity reduces the cooling load and improves air flow conditions.","With relative humidity at 20%, the power turbine can achieve a higher optimised capacity due to less moisture in the air, which decreases the cooling load compared to 60% humidity."
