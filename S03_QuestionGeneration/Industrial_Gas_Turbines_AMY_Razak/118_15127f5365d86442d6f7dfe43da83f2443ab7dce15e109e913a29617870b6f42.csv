The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2.

This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler.

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14.
