The gas generator speed limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature as the relative humidity increases, as observed in Fig. 11.31. ",What is the effect of relative humidity on NOx emissions according to the text?,"The text mentions the impact of relative humidity on NOx emissions, suggesting a relationship worth exploring.","Relative humidity's effect on NOx emissions is highlighted, indicating its significance in emissions control.","NOx emissions are influenced by relative humidity, as noted in the discussion.",The text points to relative humidity as a factor affecting NOx emissions levels.,An examination of relative humidity's role in NOx emissions is suggested by the text.

However, the increase in specific humidity reduces the thermal efficiency, due to the additional fuel required to heat the water vapour to the required turbine entry temperature. The variation of gas turbine thermal efficiency with ambient temperature for a series of values of relative humidity, is shown in Fig. 11.32. At high ambient temperatures (30 degrees Celsius), the increase in gas turbine power output due to the increase in relative humidity (from 0% to 100%) can be about 1.5% and this increase in power increases with ambient temperature. Thus, at high ambient temperature, an increase in humidity will result in a worthwhile increase in power output. Operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed, γ N₁/√( RT), an increase in the gas constant, R, due to the increase in specific humidity, will require an increase in the gas.

The gas generator speed limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature as the relative humidity increases, as observed in Fig. 11.31. ",Why is the increase in power output due to humidity more significant at higher ambient temperatures?,"At higher ambient temperatures, the air is less dense, making the humid air's higher density more beneficial for power output.",The density difference between dry and humid air becomes more advantageous for power generation in warmer conditions.,Warmer temperatures amplify the power output benefits of humid air's increased density.,"High ambient temperatures enhance the positive impact of humidity on air density, boosting power output.",The effect of humidity on increasing air density and thus power output is magnified at higher ambient temperatures.
