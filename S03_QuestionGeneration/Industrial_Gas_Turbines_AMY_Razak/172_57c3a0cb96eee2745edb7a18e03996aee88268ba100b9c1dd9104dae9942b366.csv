ρ = dM / dV [10.8]

where ρ is the static density at some midpoint within the element and V is the volume of the element.

Substituting Equation 10.8 into Equation 10.7:

V dρ = W₁ – W₂ [10.9]

The equation of state for gases is given by Ps = ρ × R × Ts. For a given temperature and gas this equation in differential form is given by:

dPs = RTs × dρ [10.10]

Note: It has been assumed that the gas or fluid is perfect and this is usually the case for air and products of combustion at pressures and temperatures present in gas turbines. Since the methods developed here are applicable to all gases, the compressibility factor, Z, discussed in Chapter 2, should be included when appropriate.

Substituting Equation 10.10 into Equation 10.9 and rearranging:

dPs = RTs (W₁ – W₂) / V [10.11]

Thus the rate of change of pressure at some midpoint within the element is given by Equation 10.11.

# 10.6.2 Momentum

In Section 10.6.1, the charging and discharging of the element due to flows entering and exiting the element were effectively considered and an equation was developed describing the rate of change of pressure within the element. It is also possible to consider the fluid within the element in motion. ",What role does the volume of the element (V) play in Equation 10.9?,"The volume (V) scales the relationship between density changes and mass flow differences, integral to pressure dynamics.","It acts as a proportionality factor, converting mass flow rate differences into density changes within the element.","V is crucial for determining how mass flow imbalances affect the fluid's density and, consequently, pressure in the element.","In Equation 10.9, V links the physical size of the element to the rate of density change due to mass flow variations.","The element's volume is a key parameter in translating flow rate differences into density and pressure changes, central to system analysis."
