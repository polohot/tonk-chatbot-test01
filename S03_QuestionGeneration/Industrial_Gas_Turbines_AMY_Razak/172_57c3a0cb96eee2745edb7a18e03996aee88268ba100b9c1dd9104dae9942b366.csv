1. **Conservation of Mass**: The law of conservation of mass states that the change in mass (M) trapped within an element is equal to the difference in mass flow rates at the inlet (W₁) and the exit (W₂) of the element. This relationship is mathematically expressed as:
   \[
   dM = W₁ - W₂ \quad [10.7]
   \]

2. **Density Relation**: The density (ρ) of the fluid within the element can be expressed in differential form as:
   \[
   \rho = \frac{dM}{dV} \quad [10.8]
   \]
   where V is the volume of the element.

3. **Substituting Density into Mass Change**: By substituting the expression for density (Equation 10.8) into the mass change equation (Equation 10.7), we obtain:
   \[
   V d\rho = W₁ - W₂ \quad [10.9]
   \]

4. **Equation of State for Gases**: The equation of state for gases relates pressure (P), density (ρ), and temperature (T) as follows:
   \[
   P_s = \rho \times R \times T_s
   \]
   In differential form, this becomes:
   \[
   dP_s = R T_s \times d\rho \quad [10.10]
   \]

5. **Substituting Pressure Change into Mass Change**: By substituting Equation 10.10 into Equation 10.9 and rearranging, we can express the rate of change of pressure (dP_s) in terms of the flow rates and volume:
   \[
   dP_s = \frac{R T_s (W₁ - W₂)}{V} \quad [10.11]
   \]

Thus, the derived equation for the rate of change of pressure within the element, \( dP_s \), is directly linked to the conservation of mass through the relationships established between mass flow rates, density, and the equation of state for gases. This shows how changes in mass flow rates at the inlet and exit of the element affect the pressure within it."

Specifically, in Equation 10.11, the rate of change of pressure (dPs) is expressed as:

\[ dPs = \frac{RTs (W₁ – W₂)}{V} \]

In this equation, \( V \) represents the volume of the element. The presence of \( V \) in the denominator indicates that the rate of change of pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. This means that for a given difference in fluid flow rates (W₁ – W₂), a smaller volume will result in a larger rate of change of pressure, while a larger volume will lead to a smaller rate of change of pressure. Therefore, the volume of the element directly influences how quickly the pressure can change in response to changes in mass flow rates entering and exiting the element."

1. **Continuity**: The principle of continuity, derived from the law of conservation of mass, states that the mass flow rate of fluid entering a system must equal the mass flow rate of fluid exiting the system, assuming there is no accumulation of mass within the system. In the context of a gas turbine, this can be expressed mathematically using the equation:

   \[
   dM = W₁ - W₂
   \]

   where \( W₁ \) is the mass flow rate entering the element and \( W₂ \) is the mass flow rate exiting. This relationship allows engineers to determine how changes in flow rates at the inlet and outlet affect the mass trapped within various components of the turbine, such as compressors, turbines, and combustors.

In the context of gas turbines, this principle dictates that the mass of fluid (air and combustion gases) entering a component must equal the mass exiting that component, assuming no mass is lost or accumulated within the system over a steady-state condition.

In practical terms, this means that the flow rates at the inlet and outlet of components such as compressors, turbines, and combustors must be carefully balanced. The equation derived from the conservation of mass, \( dM = W₁ - W₂ \), where \( W₁ \) is the mass flow rate entering the component and \( W₂ \) is the mass flow rate exiting, illustrates how the change in mass within the component is directly related to these flow rates.

When designing gas turbine components, engineers must ensure that the geometry and operational parameters (like pressure and temperature) are optimized to maintain this balance. For instance, if the inlet flow rate is higher than the outlet flow rate, it could lead to an accumulation of mass, which may affect the pressure and performance of the turbine. Conversely, if the outlet flow rate exceeds the inlet, it could indicate a loss of mass, leading to inefficiencies or potential operational issues.
