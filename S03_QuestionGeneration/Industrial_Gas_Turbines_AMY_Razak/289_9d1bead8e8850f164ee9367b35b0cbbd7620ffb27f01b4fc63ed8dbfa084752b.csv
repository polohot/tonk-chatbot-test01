# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.5 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The increase in the VIGV position to maintain the EGT on its set point during hot end damage is shown as a trend in Fig. 18.42. The VIGV opens from about 72% to 92% in order to maintain the EGT on its set point. The

Trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio due to the effect of hot end damage when operating at low power with VIGV operation.

The trend in the compressor non-dimensional speed shows no variation because the compressor speed and the inlet temperature remain constant. ",What trends are shown in Fig. 18.41 regarding flows due to hot end damage at low powers?,Fig. 18.41 shows trends in flows indicating an increase in compressor mass flow rate and fuel flow due to hot end damage at low powers.,The figure illustrates how hot end damage at low powers leads to higher compressor mass flow rate and fuel flow.,Trends in Fig. 18.41 reveal increased compressor mass flow and fuel flow under hot end damage conditions at low power.,"At low powers, hot end damage results in elevated compressor mass flow and fuel flow, as depicted in Fig. 18.41.",Fig. 18.41 displays the rise in compressor mass flow rate and fuel flow caused by hot end damage during low power operation.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.
