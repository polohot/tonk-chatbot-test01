The ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, and other airborne debris leads to the build-up of deposits on the compressor blades. This build-up decreases the effective flow area, which in turn reduces the flow coefficient of the compressor. 

As a result, the compressor's flow capacity is diminished, particularly affecting the front stages of the compressor where the flow is primarily controlled during normal high-speed operation. The fouling also alters the blade profile, increasing the likelihood of flow separation at the trailing edge, further contributing to the reduction in efficiency and overall performance of the compressor."
