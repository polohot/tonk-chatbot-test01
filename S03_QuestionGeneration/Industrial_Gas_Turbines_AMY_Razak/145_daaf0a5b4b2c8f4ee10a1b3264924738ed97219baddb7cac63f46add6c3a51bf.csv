# 9.3 Hot end damage

Hot end damage is normally associated with turbines. Turbines operate at very high gas temperatures, often above the melting point of the turbine blade material. Extensive turbine cooling is therefore employed (as discussed in Section 5.7) to achieve satisfactory turbine creep life. The highest temperatures that occur are at the stagnation points which correspond to the leading and trailing edges of the turbine blade. The trailing edge of the turbine blade has little material and cooling is often difficult; thus, over a period of time, damage can occur to this part of the turbine blade. The flow capacity of the turbine is normally controlled by the nozzle guide vane (NGV) and is determined by the flow area defined by the trailing edge of the blade. Any change in the turbine blade profile involving the trailing edge of the blade will also have an impact on the turbine characteristic and thus on the performance of the engine.

Hot end damage will normally increase the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity and any change in the incidence of the gas on the turbine rotor will also affect its efficiency. Figure 9.10 shows a schematic representation of the nozzle guide vane, indicating trailing edge damage. The increase in turbine flow capacity does not reduce turbine performance necessarily. Under certain circumstances, for example, when the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine, an increase in power output is possible; however, an adverse impact on turbine life would occur. A reduction in turbine efficiency will always have a negative impact on the gas turbine performance.

Engine life. Figures 9.11 and 9.12 show the changes in the turbine flow and efficiency characteristics due to hot end damage, respectively.

The effect of hot end damage on the gas generator turbine of a two-shaft gas turbine (using a free power turbine) would be to move the running line away from surge, as discussed in Section 8.2, ‘Displacement of running line (single- and two-shaft free power turbine gas turbine’. Thus, the variation of compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed would be similar to that observed during compressor fouling. Gas turbines that burn fuel containing high ash content may suffer from a reduction in the turbine flow capacity due to deposit of ash on the turbine components, and the variation of compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional.

# 9.4 Tip rubs and seal damage

The clearances between the rotor and the casing in turbomachinery should be kept to a minimum in order to minimise overtip leakages. In axial compressors, the stage pressure ratios are small compared with axial turbines. Thus, turbine rotors are usually provided with tip seals, in the form of a shroud to prevent such overtip leakages. Compressors normally do not have such shrouds; however, the clearances are kept to a minimum.

During normal operation, rubs occur during start-up and also, possibly, due to high vibration. Operation over a period of time will also increase these clearances due to wear. In axial compressors, an increase in tip clearance of the front stages would result in a change in both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, as it is the front stages of the compressor that control the flow. Increases in clearance of the HP stages of an axial compressor normally affect the compressor efficiency rather than the flow capacity. Thus, the change in capacity characteristic of the compressor due to front stages rubbing is similar to that of compressor fouling. However, unlike compressor fouling, this performance loss is not recoverable after an engine wash.

The effect of damage to the turbine shroud normally affects the efficiency of the turbine rather than the flow and this is mainly due to the flow capacity of the turbine being set by the choking of the nozzle guide vanes. Other seals are also provided in compressors and turbines to prevent or reduce internal leakages. One type of seal is called a labyrinth seal, which consists of knife-edges on a static or rotating component of the turbine or compressor assembly, as illustrated in Fig. 9.13. Other types of seals are honeycomb seals and ring seals. Damage to these seals normally affects the compressor/turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity.

The effect of hot end damage on the gas generator turbine of a two-shaft gas turbine (using a free power turbine) would be to move the running line away from surge, as discussed in Section 8.2, ‘Displacement of running line (single- and two-shaft free power turbine gas turbine’. Thus, the variation of compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed would be similar to that observed during compressor fouling. Gas turbines that burn fuel containing high ash content may suffer from a reduction in the turbine flow capacity due to deposit of ash on the turbine components, and the variation of compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional.

# 9.4 Tip rubs and seal damage

The clearances between the rotor and the casing in turbomachinery should be kept to a minimum in order to minimise overtip leakages. In axial compressors, the stage pressure ratios are small compared with axial turbines. Thus, turbine rotors are usually provided with tip seals, in the form of a shroud to prevent such overtip leakages. Compressors normally do not have such shrouds; however, the clearances are kept to a minimum.

During normal operation, rubs occur during start-up and also, possibly, due to high vibration. Operation over a period of time will also increase these clearances due to wear. In axial compressors, an increase in tip clearance of the front stages would result in a change in both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, as it is the front stages of the compressor that control the flow. Increases in clearance of the HP stages of an axial compressor normally affect the compressor efficiency rather than the flow capacity. Thus, the change in capacity characteristic of the compressor due to front stages rubbing is similar to that of compressor fouling. However, unlike compressor fouling, this performance loss is not recoverable after an engine wash.

The effect of damage to the turbine shroud normally affects the efficiency of the turbine rather than the flow and this is mainly due to the flow capacity of the turbine being set by the choking of the nozzle guide vanes. Other seals are also provided in compressors and turbines to prevent or reduce internal leakages. One type of seal is called a labyrinth seal, which consists of knife-edges on a static or rotating component of the turbine or compressor assembly, as illustrated in Fig. 9.13. Other types of seals are honeycomb seals and ring seals. Damage to these seals normally affects the compressor/turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity.

# 9.3 Hot end damage

Hot end damage is normally associated with turbines. Turbines operate at very high gas temperatures, often above the melting point of the turbine blade material. Extensive turbine cooling is therefore employed (as discussed in Section 5.7) to achieve satisfactory turbine creep life. The highest temperatures that occur are at the stagnation points which correspond to the leading and trailing edges of the turbine blade. The trailing edge of the turbine blade has little material and cooling is often difficult; thus, over a period of time, damage can occur to this part of the turbine blade. The flow capacity of the turbine is normally controlled by the nozzle guide vane (NGV) and is determined by the flow area defined by the trailing edge of the blade. Any change in the turbine blade profile involving the trailing edge of the blade will also have an impact on the turbine characteristic and thus on the performance of the engine.

Hot end damage will normally increase the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity and any change in the incidence of the gas on the turbine rotor will also affect its efficiency. Figure 9.10 shows a schematic representation of the nozzle guide vane, indicating trailing edge damage. The increase in turbine flow capacity does not reduce turbine performance necessarily. Under certain circumstances, for example, when the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine, an increase in power output is possible; however, an adverse impact on turbine life would occur. A reduction in turbine efficiency will always have a negative impact on the gas turbine performance.
