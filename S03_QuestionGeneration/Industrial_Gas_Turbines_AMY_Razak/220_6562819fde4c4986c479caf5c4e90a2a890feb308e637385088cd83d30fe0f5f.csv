# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

# 13.23 Trends in gas turbine emissions during compressor fouling at low power.

It has been stated that in industries where the fuel cost is relatively low, the impact of compressor fouling on revenue is small when operating at low power. However, if emissions become important, the operators may be taxed on the amount of emissions produced by their gas turbines. Then, compressor fouling at low power output becomes important as increased emissions would have an adverse effect on profitability.

# 13.2.9 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling (low power)

The displacement of the running line is no different from that shown in Fig. 13.13, as the amount of compressor fouling for the high and low power cases are the same. All that changes are the operating points, as shown in Fig. 13.24, which illustrates the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Figure 13.25 shows the displacement of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed. It is again observed that the displacement of the running line is the same as that shown for the high power case (Fig. 13.14), since the compressor fouling simulation is no different. The two operating points are shown for the clean and fouled cases, respectively, when the engine is operating at low power. The high power operating points are also shown for comparison.

# Turbine damage

Turbines are exposed to very high temperatures, particularly the gas generator turbine, and these turbines often employ cooling to achieve satisfactory

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft creep life

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

13.30 Trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio results in a decrease in the compressor discharge temperature. Since the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance (constant EGT), the decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as explained, will decrease the turbine.

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

entry temperature, the primary zone temperature and T₃/T₁, as seen in Fig. 13.28. However, the decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio will increase the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, as seen in Fig. 13.30.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

13.30 Trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio results in a decrease in the compressor discharge temperature. Since the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance (constant EGT), the decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as explained, will decrease the turbine.

entry temperature, the primary zone temperature and T₃/T₁, as seen in Fig. 13.28. However, the decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio will increase the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, as seen in Fig. 13.30.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

# 13.23 Trends in gas turbine emissions during compressor fouling at low power.

It has been stated that in industries where the fuel cost is relatively low, the impact of compressor fouling on revenue is small when operating at low power. However, if emissions become important, the operators may be taxed on the amount of emissions produced by their gas turbines. Then, compressor fouling at low power output becomes important as increased emissions would have an adverse effect on profitability.

# 13.2.9 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling (low power)

The displacement of the running line is no different from that shown in Fig. 13.13, as the amount of compressor fouling for the high and low power cases are the same. All that changes are the operating points, as shown in Fig. 13.24, which illustrates the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Figure 13.25 shows the displacement of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed. It is again observed that the displacement of the running line is the same as that shown for the high power case (Fig. 13.14), since the compressor fouling simulation is no different. The two operating points are shown for the clean and fouled cases, respectively, when the engine is operating at low power. The high power operating points are also shown for comparison.

# Turbine damage

Turbines are exposed to very high temperatures, particularly the gas generator turbine, and these turbines often employ cooling to achieve satisfactory

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft creep life

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio results in a decrease in the compressor discharge temperature. Since the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance (constant EGT), the decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as explained, will decrease the turbine.

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

entry temperature, the primary zone temperature and T₃/T₁, as seen in Fig. 13.28. However, the decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio will increase the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, as seen in Fig. 13.30.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

# 13.23 Trends in gas turbine emissions during compressor fouling at low power.

It has been stated that in industries where the fuel cost is relatively low, the impact of compressor fouling on revenue is small when operating at low power. However, if emissions become important, the operators may be taxed on the amount of emissions produced by their gas turbines. Then, compressor fouling at low power output becomes important as increased emissions would have an adverse effect on profitability.

# 13.2.9 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling (low power)

The displacement of the running line is no different from that shown in Fig. 13.13, as the amount of compressor fouling for the high and low power cases are the same. All that changes are the operating points, as shown in Fig. 13.24, which illustrates the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Figure 13.25 shows the displacement of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed. It is again observed that the displacement of the running line is the same as that shown for the high power case (Fig. 13.14), since the compressor fouling simulation is no different. The two operating points are shown for the clean and fouled cases, respectively, when the engine is operating at low power. The high power operating points are also shown for comparison.

# Turbine damage

Turbines are exposed to very high temperatures, particularly the gas generator turbine, and these turbines often employ cooling to achieve satisfactory

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft creep life

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio results in a decrease in the compressor discharge temperature. Since the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance (constant EGT), the decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as explained, will decrease the turbine.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

# 13.23 Trends in gas turbine emissions during compressor fouling at low power.

It has been stated that in industries where the fuel cost is relatively low, the impact of compressor fouling on revenue is small when operating at low power. However, if emissions become important, the operators may be taxed on the amount of emissions produced by their gas turbines. Then, compressor fouling at low power output becomes important as increased emissions would have an adverse effect on profitability.

# 13.2.9 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling (low power)

The displacement of the running line is no different from that shown in Fig. 13.13, as the amount of compressor fouling for the high and low power cases are the same. All that changes are the operating points, as shown in Fig. 13.24, which illustrates the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Figure 13.25 shows the displacement of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed. It is again observed that the displacement of the running line is the same as that shown for the high power case (Fig. 13.14), since the compressor fouling simulation is no different. The two operating points are shown for the clean and fouled cases, respectively, when the engine is operating at low power. The high power operating points are also shown for comparison.

# Turbine damage

Turbines are exposed to very high temperatures, particularly the gas generator turbine, and these turbines often employ cooling to achieve satisfactory

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft creep life

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

# 13.23 Trends in gas turbine emissions during compressor fouling at low power.

It has been stated that in industries where the fuel cost is relatively low, the impact of compressor fouling on revenue is small when operating at low power. However, if emissions become important, the operators may be taxed on the amount of emissions produced by their gas turbines. Then, compressor fouling at low power output becomes important as increased emissions would have an adverse effect on profitability.

# 13.2.9 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling (low power)

The displacement of the running line is no different from that shown in Fig. 13.13, as the amount of compressor fouling for the high and low power cases are the same. All that changes are the operating points, as shown in Fig. 13.24, which illustrates the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Figure 13.25 shows the displacement of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed. It is again observed that the displacement of the running line is the same as that shown for the high power case (Fig. 13.14), since the compressor fouling simulation is no different. The two operating points are shown for the clean and fouled cases, respectively, when the engine is operating at low power. The high power operating points are also shown for comparison.

# Turbine damage

Turbines are exposed to very high temperatures, particularly the gas generator turbine, and these turbines often employ cooling to achieve satisfactory

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft creep life

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio results in a decrease in the compressor discharge temperature. Since the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance (constant EGT), the decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as explained, will decrease the turbine.

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down.

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.

# 13.22 Trends in creep life during compressor fouling

The power turbine operates at a constant speed as dictated by the generator with the load being constant, thus the stress in the power turbine blades will also remain constant. However, the increase in the exhaust gas temperature due to compressor fouling results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature leading to an increase in power turbine creep life usage. Note that the gas generator turbine time to overhaul decreases from about 75,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling to about 35,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The power turbine time to overhaul is in excess of 300,000 hours at the start of compressor fouling and decreases to about 240,000 hours at the end of compressor fouling. The creep life for both turbines at the end of compressor fouling is still in excess of the hours when engine overhauls take place (about 20,000 hours). Thus decreases in turbine creep life are of little consequence unless the actual turbine creep life is monitored. As the creep life is in excess of 20,000 hours at low gas turbine power outputs, proper monitoring of turbine creep life usage can result in a significant increase in time between overhauls resulting in reduced maintenance costs.

# 13.2.8 Trends in emissions

The increase in primary zone temperature during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.17, results in an increase in NOx during fouling, although there is a slight decrease in compressor discharge pressure and therefore in combustion pressure. The effect of the changes in these parameters on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow due to the reduction in gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in CO2 emission and this is seen in Fig.

# 13.23 Trends in gas turbine emissions during compressor fouling at low power.

It has been stated that in industries where the fuel cost is relatively low, the impact of compressor fouling on revenue is small when operating at low power. However, if emissions become important, the operators may be taxed on the amount of emissions produced by their gas turbines. Then, compressor fouling at low power output becomes important as increased emissions would have an adverse effect on profitability.

# 13.2.9 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling (low power)

The displacement of the running line is no different from that shown in Fig. 13.13, as the amount of compressor fouling for the high and low power cases are the same. All that changes are the operating points, as shown in Fig. 13.24, which illustrates the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Figure 13.25 shows the displacement of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed. It is again observed that the displacement of the running line is the same as that shown for the high power case (Fig. 13.14), since the compressor fouling simulation is no different. The two operating points are shown for the clean and fouled cases, respectively, when the engine is operating at low power. The high power operating points are also shown for comparison.

# Turbine damage

Turbines are exposed to very high temperatures, particularly the gas generator turbine, and these turbines often employ cooling to achieve satisfactory

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft creep life

However, during exposure to high temperatures over prolonged periods, damage can occur resulting in a change in performance of the turbines. Two cases of deterioration for turbines will be considered. First, the effect of hot end damage as discussed in Section 9.3 will be simulated. Hot end damage will be applied to the gas generator turbine, as this is where hot end damage is most likely to occur. Secondly, the effect of turbine rotor tip rub will be simulated and this deterioration applied to the power turbine, although such deterioration could occur with either turbine.

# 13.3.1 Hot end damage

Hot end damage results in an increase in non-dimensional flow of the turbine. Thus, the effects of hot end damage are simulated by increasing the gas generator turbine fouling fault index to 3%. Since such damage is likely to reduce the turbine efficiency, the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index is also reduced by 2% simultaneously. Hot end damage may occur over a long period due to prolonged exposure of the turbine to high temperature combustion gases, or it may occur in a short period of time due to combustion problems that result in a poor combustor temperature traverse.

Since slow deterioration was considered when compressor fouling was discussed, turbine deterioration will be introduced over a short period of time, where these changes in the fault indices are applied in a 10-second time period. To see the impact of this deterioration on engine performance at high power output conditions, the generator power demand is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity are set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the engine performance will be limited by the exhaust gas temperature limit. Figure 13.26 shows the trends in the fault indices where it can be seen that the gas generator turbine fouling fault index increases from 0 to 3% and its efficiency fault index decreases simultaneously from 0 to –2% in 10 seconds.

# Trends in speed

In Section 8.2, the displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic due to the reduced gas generator turbine non-dimensional flow caused by closing the NGV of the turbine was discussed. This resulted in an increase in the gas generator pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.13, to maintain the required non-dimensional flow into the power turbine. The non-dimensional flow into the gas generator turbine has now been increased in order to simulate the impact of hot end damage on engine performance. As a result, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases.

This reduction in gas generator turbine pressure ratio will reduce work done by the gas generator turbine and thus the power output from the turbine.

13.26 Trends in gas generator turbine fault indices due to hot end damage in the power turbine.

Since the power output from the gas generator turbine drives the compressor, the gas generator will slow down, as seen in Fig. 13.27, where the speed trends are shown. The compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease due to the reduction in the gas generator speed.

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The reduction in gas generator speed due to hot end damage will reduce the compressor pressure ratio as the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves down. The effect of increased non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine due to hot end damage will also move the compressor running line away from surge, thus further reducing the compressor pressure ratio. This can be seen in Fig. 13.28, which shows the trends in pressure ratios due to the effect of hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. The trends also show a reduction in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

It is also observed that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases due to increasing non-dimensional flow through the gas generator turbine, as discussed previously. The compressor pressure ratio decreases from about 17.3 to 15.8, whereas the gas generator turbine pressure ratio decreases from about 4.1 to about 3.9. Since the fall in compressor pressure ratio is greater than the fall in gas generator turbine pressure ratio, a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio is observed.

13.30 Trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are shown in Fig. 13.30. The reduction in compressor pressure ratio results in a decrease in the compressor discharge temperature. Since the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance (constant EGT), the decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as explained, will decrease the turbine.

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

entry temperature, the primary zone temperature and T₃/T₁, as seen in Fig. 13.28. However, the decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio will increase the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, as seen in Fig. 13.30.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The decrease in the gas generator turbine efficiency and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, reduces the specific work. Furthermore, the compressor inlet airflow will also decrease as can be seen in Fig. 13.32, resulting in a decrease in the gas power and the gas turbine power output. The decreases in compressor pressure ratio, gas generator turbine efficiency and the cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in a decrease in the thermal efficiency. Thus the decrease in powers and thermal efficiencies are observed as shown in Fig. 13.31, where the trends in power and thermal efficiency due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine are illustrated.

The generator power output decreases from about 20.5 MW to 18.1 MW, representing nearly a 12% loss in generation power and thus revenue. The gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases from about 36% to 34.6%, this representing nearly 4% increase in fuel cost in real terms.
