produce as an exercise. The increase in compressor airflow and therefore increased exhaust flow rate due to turbine inlet cooling also increases the heat rejection from the gas turbine and is beneficial to combined cycle power plants.

Turbine inlet cooling using wetted media and fogging requires water for evaporation and water requirements are shown in Fig. 14.23. The simulator is a useful calculator to determine the water requirements for a given level of turbine inlet cooling. The information can be scaled to suit any gas turbine engine. Details are given in the simulation user guide. With chillers,

It can be seen that chillers produce the largest gain in power output, followed by fogging and wetted media. The figure also shows the effect of the cooling technology employed by chillers. With vapour compression chillers, the impact of power demand by the chiller on generator output is significant and appears as a parasitic loss. Nevertheless, there is still a significant increase in power output at the generator terminals. With vapour absorption chillers, this parasitic loss is small and is ignored by the simulator as the simulator represents an open cycle gas turbine, and the heating required by the absorption refrigeration system can be provided from the gas turbine exhaust heat.

The decrease in compressor inlet temperature due to turbine inlet cooling also increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine, which the user should
