# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure on engine performance

The impact of the change in ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Chapter 11, where the negative impact of high ambient temperatures on performance was observed. Another factor that affects engine performance is the ambient pressure, where low ambient pressure reduces maximum power output from the engine. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to investigate the effects of the change in ambient pressure on engine performance.

The ambient pressure may change quite significantly at a given elevation. At sea level it may vary from 1.04 Bar to 0.96 Bar for a high pressure day and a low pressure day, respectively. This represents about an 8% change in ambient pressure corresponding to those days. Gas turbines that operate at high elevations, where the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level will show a reduced power output. For example, at an elevation of 1000 metres, the ambient pressure would be about 0.9 Bar on an ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) day. However, the ambient temperature at this altitude will be lower, thus partly compensating for the reduced power output.

To cover this ambient pressure range, the ambient pressure will be varied from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour (3600 seconds). Also considered will be two operating cases, which correspond to high power and low power operating conditions. ",How does an increase in relative humidity at low ambient temperatures affect the power output of a gas turbine when limited by gas generator speed or N1/√T1?,There is a very small loss in power output due to minimal changes in gas properties like R and cp.,The power output decreases slightly because the changes in gas properties such as R and cp are small.,"Minimal impact on power output is observed, as the alterations in gas properties (R and cp) are negligible.","A negligible reduction in power output occurs, attributed to minor variations in gas properties including R and cp.","The effect is a slight decrease in power output, resulting from small changes in the gas's R and cp values."
