3. Start the simulator and introduce a variable stator vane (VSV) fault where the VSV has closed. This fault is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index to –10. Now load the gas turbine by setting the power demand from the generator to 20 MW. Explain why the generator power demand cannot be met and what limits the power output. Ambient pressure and temperature are 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius.
",What will be the consequence of a VSV fault where the VSV has closed on the electrical system?,"The consequence of a VSV fault where the VSV has closed is that the compressor's efficiency decreases, leading to a reduced power output from the gas turbine.","A closed VSV fault results in compressor fouling, which diminishes the gas turbine's ability to meet the generator power demand due to decreased airflow and efficiency.","When the VSV closes unexpectedly, it simulates a compressor fouling condition, causing the gas turbine to underperform and fail to achieve the desired power output.","The electrical system experiences a drop in power generation capacity because the VSV fault (closed position) leads to compressor inefficiency, limiting the gas turbine's output.","A VSV fault that causes the VSV to close affects the electrical system by reducing the gas turbine's power output, as the compressor cannot operate optimally under fouling conditions."

",What will the loss in power output be if the proportional band is 75% instead of 100%?,"If the proportional band is reduced to 75% from 100%, the power output loss will be significant, as the system's ability to respond to load demands is compromised.","A proportional band of 75% instead of 100% leads to a decrease in power output, as the control system's sensitivity and response to changes are reduced.","The loss in power output when the proportional band is 75% can be attributed to the diminished control system efficiency, resulting in less optimal performance under load.",Reducing the proportional band to 75% causes a loss in power output because the system cannot adjust as effectively to maintain optimal performance levels.,"With a proportional band set at 75%, the power output is lower than at 100% due to the system's reduced capability to manage and adapt to the generator's power demand efficiently."

","Why can the generator power demand of 20 MW not be met when a VSV fault is introduced, and what limits the power output?","The generator power demand of 20 MW cannot be met due to the VSV fault causing compressor fouling, which limits the gas turbine's power output by reducing efficiency and airflow.","A VSV fault that closes the VSV leads to compressor fouling, restricting the gas turbine's ability to generate enough power to meet the 20 MW demand, thus limiting output.","The inability to meet the 20 MW demand stems from the VSV fault-induced compressor fouling, which hampers the gas turbine's performance by limiting its operational efficiency.","When a VSV fault closes the VSV, it simulates compressor fouling, directly impacting the gas turbine's power output and preventing it from reaching the 20 MW generator demand.","The power output is limited and the 20 MW demand cannot be met because the VSV fault causes the compressor to foul, significantly reducing the gas turbine's efficiency and output capacity."
