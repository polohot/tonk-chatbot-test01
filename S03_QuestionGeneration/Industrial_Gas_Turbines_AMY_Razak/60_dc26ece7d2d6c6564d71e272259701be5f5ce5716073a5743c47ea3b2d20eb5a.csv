# 4.1 Axial compressors

An axial compressor consists of a series of stages where each stage comprises a rotor and a stator as shown in Fig. 4.1. The kinetic energy of the working fluid, which is usually air, is increased by the rotor and then diffused (the air velocity is reduced) in the stage to increase the static pressure at the outlet of the stage. The amount of diffusion in the rotor and stator is controlled by

the design of the compressor and is often called the reaction of the stage. When all the diffusion takes place in the rotor, the reaction is said to be 100%, and when all the diffusion takes place in the stator, the reaction is 0% (also known as impulse stage). High diffusion in the rotor or stator reduces the efficiency of the compressor and it is normal practice to design for 50% reaction, in which case the diffusion is equal in the stator and the rotor. This is the case at blade mid-height.
