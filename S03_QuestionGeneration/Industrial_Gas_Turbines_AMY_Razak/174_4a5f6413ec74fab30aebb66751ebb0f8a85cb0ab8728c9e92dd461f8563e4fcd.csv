Using a similar argument to that above for continuity, the dynamics of the energy equation can be considered. The rate of change of the internal energy, U, of the element can be given by:

The internal energy for the element is given by:

U =  McvT                                                 [10.17]

where c is the specific heat at constant volume and T is the mean temperature of the element.

The rate of change of internal energy can be represented by:

dU =  ∂U dM +  ∂U dT                                      [10.18]

From Equation 10.17,  ∂U  = c T and  ∂U  = Mc. Substituting these partial derivatives into Equation 10.18:

dU = c T dM  + Mc dT                                    [10.19]

# 10.6.5 Choice of model

Much of the early work on dynamic simulation of gas turbines was carried out by Corbett and Elder5 and also by Elder and MacDougal6. They report that the simulated results for the lumped and linearly distributed models were in good agreement, but that the linear model required a significant increase in computational effort (some 2–3 times more computing time). Thus lumped models are often employed in the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines. It should be pointed out that such models are equally applicable in the simulation of gas compression system present in the process industry.7

The equations described use static values for pressures and temperatures. However, total or stagnation values for these parameters are preferable in analysing engine performance in general. If element boundaries are chosen where the Mach number is low (Mx < 0.3), the differences between the static and total values will be small and the values computed using the equations described above could be treated as total or stagnation values. Examples of such boundaries are upstream and downstream of compressor stages rather than choosing boundaries between the rotor and stator of a compressor stage or close to the rotor inlet where the velocities are very high.

The assumption in the lumped parameter model imposes frequency limitations because second- or higher-order equations are being solved. Such systems of equations employed in predicting transient performance of gas turbines and gas compression systems are capable of simulating longitudinal waves. For air, the element length, Δx, in Equation 10.26 should be less than about 34 metres (Δx << 34 m) as determined by Corbett and Elder5. This is usually the case with gas turbine components.

It should be noted that these models are capable of simulating compressor surge cycles. Elder and Macdougal6 developed a frequency parameter model to account for surge and pre-surge oscillations during the transient response of the compressor element. They related a frequency parameter to the phase change across the compressor element in terms of an expected error when comparing the lumped parameter model with the true solutions. Using an

# Engine control systems and transient performance

expected frequency of interest, fₓ, and Mach number, Mₓ, of 0.3 or less, a suitable element length for the compressor could be determined using:

2πfₓΔx &lt; a(1 – Mₓ) [10.28]

where a is the velocity of sound.

Although the above analysis improves the simulation, the elements do not communicate in a realistic manner if the adjacent element volumes are significantly different. In order for elements to interact in a realistic manner, a criterion of approximately equal volumes is used, in conjunction with the frequency parameter model.

Other researchers in the field of transient analysis of gas turbines include Greitzer8 and Fawke and Saravamuttoo9. Although Greitzer used a similar approach to the one described by Elder and discussed above, Fawke and Saravamuttoo restricted their models to continuity only. Pre- and post-surge oscillations are unavailable using the continuity-only model.

# 10.6.6 Element definition

The starting values for pressures, flows, temperatures and speeds for transient analysis would be determined by a steady-state model of the gas turbine as discussed in Chapter 7. However, the force and energy terms Fₙₑₜ and Eₙₑₜ need to be defined in Equations 10.26 and 10.27, respectively. These are determined by applying the quasi-steady-state assumption, where the instantaneous values are used with the steady-state component characteristic to determine these terms, as discussed below.

# Compressor

In the dynamic simulation of gas turbines, it is usual to employ compressor stage characteristics rather than overall characteristics as discussed in Chapter 7, where the prediction of the off-design performance of the gas turbine was considered. These stage characteristics are normally stacked together10 to produce the overall characteristic used in the prediction of the steady-state performance of the gas turbine. A typical compressor stage characteristic is shown in Fig. 10.16.

# 10.6.5 Choice of model

Much of the early work on dynamic simulation of gas turbines was carried out by Corbett and Elder5 and also by Elder and MacDougal6. They report that the simulated results for the lumped and linearly distributed models were in good agreement, but that the linear model required a significant increase in computational effort (some 2–3 times more computing time). Thus lumped models are often employed in the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines. It should be pointed out that such models are equally applicable in the simulation of gas compression system present in the process industry.7

The equations described use static values for pressures and temperatures. However, total or stagnation values for these parameters are preferable in analysing engine performance in general. If element boundaries are chosen where the Mach number is low (Mx < 0.3), the differences between the static and total values will be small and the values computed using the equations described above could be treated as total or stagnation values. Examples of such boundaries are upstream and downstream of compressor stages rather than choosing boundaries between the rotor and stator of a compressor stage or close to the rotor inlet where the velocities are very high.

The assumption in the lumped parameter model imposes frequency limitations because second- or higher-order equations are being solved. Such systems of equations employed in predicting transient performance of gas turbines and gas compression systems are capable of simulating longitudinal waves. For air, the element length, Δx, in Equation 10.26 should be less than about 34 metres (Δx << 34 m) as determined by Corbett and Elder5. This is usually the case with gas turbine components.

It should be noted that these models are capable of simulating compressor surge cycles. Elder and Macdougal6 developed a frequency parameter model to account for surge and pre-surge oscillations during the transient response of the compressor element. They related a frequency parameter to the phase change across the compressor element in terms of an expected error when comparing the lumped parameter model with the true solutions. Using an

expected frequency of interest, fₓ, and Mach number, Mₓ, of 0.3 or less, a suitable element length for the compressor could be determined using:

2πfₓΔx &lt; a(1 – Mₓ) [10.28]

where a is the velocity of sound.

Although the above analysis improves the simulation, the elements do not communicate in a realistic manner if the adjacent element volumes are significantly different. In order for elements to interact in a realistic manner, a criterion of approximately equal volumes is used, in conjunction with the frequency parameter model.

Other researchers in the field of transient analysis of gas turbines include Greitzer8 and Fawke and Saravamuttoo9. Although Greitzer used a similar approach to the one described by Elder and discussed above, Fawke and Saravamuttoo restricted their models to continuity only. Pre- and post-surge oscillations are unavailable using the continuity-only model.

# 10.6.6 Element definition

The starting values for pressures, flows, temperatures and speeds for transient analysis would be determined by a steady-state model of the gas turbine as discussed in Chapter 7. However, the force and energy terms Fₙₑₜ and Eₙₑₜ need to be defined in Equations 10.26 and 10.27, respectively. These are determined by applying the quasi-steady-state assumption, where the instantaneous values are used with the steady-state component characteristic to determine these terms, as discussed below.

# Compressor

In the dynamic simulation of gas turbines, it is usual to employ compressor stage characteristics rather than overall characteristics as discussed in Chapter 7, where the prediction of the off-design performance of the gas turbine was considered. These stage characteristics are normally stacked together10 to produce the overall characteristic used in the prediction of the steady-state performance of the gas turbine. A typical compressor stage characteristic is shown in Fig. 10.16. ",What does Equation 10.16 represent in the energy dynamics of an element?,"Equation 10.16 represents the rate of change of internal energy, dU/dt, as W1cp1T1 - W2cp2T2 + Enet.","It shows how internal energy changes over time due to energy flows at inlet and exit, plus any net external energy.",The equation dU/dt = W1cp1T1 - W2cp2T2 + Enet accounts for energy transport and external energy input or loss.,This equation models the internal energy rate change by considering energy carried by flow and external energy contributions.,"dU/dt is given by the difference in energy flow rates at the boundaries plus the net external energy, Enet."

# 10.6.5 Choice of model

Much of the early work on dynamic simulation of gas turbines was carried out by Corbett and Elder5 and also by Elder and MacDougal6. They report that the simulated results for the lumped and linearly distributed models were in good agreement, but that the linear model required a significant increase in computational effort (some 2–3 times more computing time). Thus lumped models are often employed in the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines. It should be pointed out that such models are equally applicable in the simulation of gas compression system present in the process industry.7

The equations described use static values for pressures and temperatures. However, total or stagnation values for these parameters are preferable in analysing engine performance in general. If element boundaries are chosen where the Mach number is low (Mx < 0.3), the differences between the static and total values will be small and the values computed using the equations described above could be treated as total or stagnation values. Examples of such boundaries are upstream and downstream of compressor stages rather than choosing boundaries between the rotor and stator of a compressor stage or close to the rotor inlet where the velocities are very high.

The assumption in the lumped parameter model imposes frequency limitations because second- or higher-order equations are being solved. Such systems of equations employed in predicting transient performance of gas turbines and gas compression systems are capable of simulating longitudinal waves. For air, the element length, Δx, in Equation 10.26 should be less than about 34 metres (Δx << 34 m) as determined by Corbett and Elder5. This is usually the case with gas turbine components.

It should be noted that these models are capable of simulating compressor surge cycles. Elder and Macdougal6 developed a frequency parameter model to account for surge and pre-surge oscillations during the transient response of the compressor element. They related a frequency parameter to the phase change across the compressor element in terms of an expected error when comparing the lumped parameter model with the true solutions. Using an

# Engine control systems and transient performance

expected frequency of interest, fₓ, and Mach number, Mₓ, of 0.3 or less, a suitable element length for the compressor could be determined using:

2πfₓΔx &lt; a(1 – Mₓ) [10.28]

where a is the velocity of sound.

Although the above analysis improves the simulation, the elements do not communicate in a realistic manner if the adjacent element volumes are significantly different. In order for elements to interact in a realistic manner, a criterion of approximately equal volumes is used, in conjunction with the frequency parameter model.

Other researchers in the field of transient analysis of gas turbines include Greitzer8 and Fawke and Saravamuttoo9. Although Greitzer used a similar approach to the one described by Elder and discussed above, Fawke and Saravamuttoo restricted their models to continuity only. Pre- and post-surge oscillations are unavailable using the continuity-only model.

# 10.6.6 Element definition

The starting values for pressures, flows, temperatures and speeds for transient analysis would be determined by a steady-state model of the gas turbine as discussed in Chapter 7. However, the force and energy terms Fₙₑₜ and Eₙₑₜ need to be defined in Equations 10.26 and 10.27, respectively. These are determined by applying the quasi-steady-state assumption, where the instantaneous values are used with the steady-state component characteristic to determine these terms, as discussed below.

These stage characteristics are normally stacked together10 to produce the overall characteristic used in the prediction of the steady-state performance of the gas turbine. A typical compressor stage characteristic is shown in Fig. 10.16. ",Why are lumped models often preferred in the transient performance prediction of gas turbines?,"Lumped models are preferred due to their computational efficiency, requiring significantly less computing time than linearly distributed models.","Because they offer a good balance between accuracy and computational effort, making them practical for simulations.","Their reduced computational demand, without significant loss of accuracy, makes them suitable for gas turbine performance predictions.","Lumped models simplify the simulation process, allowing for faster computations while still providing reliable results.",The preference stems from their ability to simulate transient performance effectively with less computational resources.

# 10.6.3 Energy

Using a similar argument to that above for continuity, the dynamics of the energy equation can be considered. The rate of change of the internal energy, U, of the element can be given by:

dU = Wc T1 – Wc T2 + E                             [10.16]

dt     1 p1 1    2  p2 2    net

where Enet is the net external energy entering or leaving the element and T1 and T2 are the total or stagnation temperatures at inlet and exit of the element.

The internal energy for the element is given by:

U =  McvT                                                 [10.17]

where c is the specific heat at constant volume and T is the mean temperature of the element.

The rate of change of internal energy can be represented by:

dU =  ∂U dM +  ∂U dT                                      [10.18]

# Engine control systems and transient performance

From Equation 10.17,  ∂U  = c T and  ∂U  = Mc. Substituting these partial derivatives into Equation 10.18:

dU = c T dM  + Mc dT                                    [10.19]

# 10.6.4 Linearly distributed and lumped model

The rates of change of pressures, flows and temperatures discussed above occur at some midpoint within the element. However, these rates of change are required either at the inlet or exit of the element. Two models can be used to determine these rates of change at the required element boundary and they correspond to the linearly distributed and lumped models.

The linearly distributed model assumes that these rates of change are linear across the element. Applying the linear distributed model to Equations 10.11, 10.15 and 10.21:

# 10.6.5 Choice of model

Much of the early work on dynamic simulation of gas turbines was carried out by Corbett and Elder5 and also by Elder and MacDougal6. They report that the simulated results for the lumped and linearly distributed models were in good agreement, but that the linear model required a significant increase in computational effort (some 2–3 times more computing time). Thus lumped models are often employed in the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines. It should be pointed out that such models are equally applicable in the simulation of gas compression system present in the process industry.7

The equations described use static values for pressures and temperatures. However, total or stagnation values for these parameters are preferable in analysing engine performance in general. If element boundaries are chosen where the Mach number is low (Mx < 0.3), the differences between the static and total values will be small and the values computed using the equations described above could be treated as total or stagnation values. Examples of such boundaries are upstream and downstream of compressor stages rather than choosing boundaries between the rotor and stator of a compressor stage or close to the rotor inlet where the velocities are very high.

The assumption in the lumped parameter model imposes frequency limitations because second- or higher-order equations are being solved. Such systems of equations employed in predicting transient performance of gas turbines and gas compression systems are capable of simulating longitudinal waves. For air, the element length, Δx, in Equation 10.26 should be less than about 34 metres (Δx << 34 m) as determined by Corbett and Elder5. This is usually the case with gas turbine components.

It should be noted that these models are capable of simulating compressor surge cycles. Elder and Macdougal6 developed a frequency parameter model to account for surge and pre-surge oscillations during the transient response of the compressor element. They related a frequency parameter to the phase change across the compressor element in terms of an expected error when comparing the lumped parameter model with the true solutions. Using an

# Engine control systems and transient performance

expected frequency of interest, fₓ, and Mach number, Mₓ, of 0.3 or less, a suitable element length for the compressor could be determined using:

2πfₓΔx &lt; a(1 – Mₓ) [10.28]

where a is the velocity of sound.

Although the above analysis improves the simulation, the elements do not communicate in a realistic manner if the adjacent element volumes are significantly different. In order for elements to interact in a realistic manner, a criterion of approximately equal volumes is used, in conjunction with the frequency parameter model.

Other researchers in the field of transient analysis of gas turbines include Greitzer8 and Fawke and Saravamuttoo9. Although Greitzer used a similar approach to the one described by Elder and discussed above, Fawke and Saravamuttoo restricted their models to continuity only. Pre- and post-surge oscillations are unavailable using the continuity-only model.

# 10.6.6 Element definition

The starting values for pressures, flows, temperatures and speeds for transient analysis would be determined by a steady-state model of the gas turbine as discussed in Chapter 7. However, the force and energy terms Fₙₑₜ and Eₙₑₜ need to be defined in Equations 10.26 and 10.27, respectively. These are determined by applying the quasi-steady-state assumption, where the instantaneous values are used with the steady-state component characteristic to determine these terms, as discussed below.

# Compressor

In the dynamic simulation of gas turbines, it is usual to employ compressor stage characteristics rather than overall characteristics as discussed in Chapter 7, where the prediction of the off-design performance of the gas turbine was considered. These stage characteristics are normally stacked together10 to produce the overall characteristic used in the prediction of the steady-state performance of the gas turbine. A typical compressor stage characteristic is shown in Fig. 10.16.
