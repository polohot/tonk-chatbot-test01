For a given power turbine pressure ratio, the efficiency is dependent on the non-dimensional speed of the turbine, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The power turbine speed (mechanical speed) is determined by the driven load, and therefore the driven load has a direct impact on the power turbine non-dimensional speed.

In our simulator, it has been assumed that the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which requires the power turbine speed to remain constant with the change in load to maintain the required frequency. However, in other cases such as mechanical drive applications (process compressors and pumps), the speed of the process compressor may be low during dense phase operation due to high suction pressures in the process compressor. The process compressor speed and therefore the power turbine speed may be as low as 70% of the rated (100%) speed. Hence it is important to determine the power output of the gas turbine at different power turbine speeds.

Figure 14.26 shows the variation of the power developed by the power turbine with power turbine speed at ISO conditions and zero inlet and exhaust losses. The power output has been drawn for different gas generator speeds and of particular interest is the 100% gas generator (GG) speed, as this situation normally corresponds to the maximum gas power generated by the gas generator. At a power turbine of 70% speed, which corresponds to a power turbine 2100 RPM, the power output decreases by about 11%, hence illustrating the importance of the power turbine performance. At high power turbine speeds, there is little variation of power turbine efficiency with the power turbine non-dimensional speed, thus resulting in a relatively flat power curve when operating at these speeds. It will therefore be necessary for our loads to operate at relatively high speeds or a very flat power turbine curve will be required if a significant loss in power is not to be incurred at low power turbine speeds (similar in shape to the curve describing the 85% GG speed in Fig. 14.26). The figure also shows the effect of the gas generator speed on power output. There is a loss in power output at lower gas generator speeds due to the reduction in air mass flow and turbine entry temperature and generally in pressure ratio (i.e. reduced gas power).

14.27 Variation of gas turbine efficiency with power output for different power turbine speeds.

The variation of the gas turbine thermal efficiency with power output for different power turbine speeds is shown in Fig. 14.27. The decrease in thermal efficiency with power for a given power turbine speed is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed, resulting in lower compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. However, for a given power output, the thermal efficiency improves with the increase in power turbine speed and this is due.

# 404 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

to the improvement in the power turbine efficiency. At high power turbine speeds (around 3000 RPM), there is only a small variation in the thermal efficiency with the power turbine speed and this is due to minimal variation in power turbine efficiency at these speeds. Thus the loss in performance in the power turbine at low speeds is responsible for the low thermal efficiency at these power turbine speeds.

Furthermore, gas turbines are most efficient at high load conditions and, if a significant turndown in power is required, it is best to employ two smaller engines, where each engine operates near its design condition at any given load condition. This is the principle of Combination Of Gas turbine Or Gas turbine (COGOG)/Combination Of Gas turbine And Gas turbine (COGAG) where one engine is used at low powers and either or both engines operate at higher power requirements.

The principle of COGOG and COGAG is often used in naval applications where the cruise speed of the ship is about half the boost speed. Due to the propeller law, which states that the power required is proportional to the cube of the speed, the cruise power requirement is only about 12.5% of the boost power requirements. At such low powers, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine will be very poor. The thermal efficiency at cruise conditions is improved by employing a smaller gas turbine to operate at cruise conditions and switching to a larger gas turbine for boost conditions. The power output of the cruise gas turbine is about 30% of the total propulsive power requirement. It is worth noting that naval ships spend a significant time (about 95%) at cruise conditions.

For naval applications, the use of a variable pitch propeller would enable the power turbine speed to be varied independently of the power requirements. By employing a variable pitch propeller, it would be possible to operate at the maximum thermal efficiency for a given gas generator speed resulting in a useful improvement in thermal efficiency, particularly at low power operation, typical of cruise conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.28, where the gas turbine thermal efficiency is displayed as a function of power turbine speed for different gas generator speeds. The figure shows the load lines for a fixed pitch propeller and also for an electrical generator. The optimum line indicates what could be achieved by using a variable pitch propeller for naval propulsion. At low power, a 4% improvement in thermal efficiency may be possible using a variable pitch propeller and this corresponds to a significant reduction in fuel cost.

The impact of the change in fuel from natural gas to diesel on gas turbine performance will now be considered. Table 14.1 shows the tabulated output of the exhaust gas composition as mole percentages when the gas turbine is operating with natural gas. Table 14.2 shows the tabulated output for the case when the gas turbine is operating with diesel fuel. Note that the exhaust gas composition has changed in that the amount of CO2 has increased and the amount of H2O has decreased when.

Diesel fuel is employed. The decrease in H2O results in a decrease in the specific heat of the products of combustion, cp. However, the impact of the isentropic index, γ = cp/cv, is small when changing from natural gas to diesel. The isentropic index, γ, relates to cp by the expression 1/γ = 1 – R/cp, where R = Ro/MW is the gas constant of the products of combustion, and Ro and MW are the universal gas constant and molecular weight, respectively. An increase in R when operating with natural gas is due to its lower molecular weight compared with diesel fuel, but this is compensated by the increase in cp. Hence only a small change in γ occurs when switching from natural gas to diesel. However, the increase in cp results in an increase in the power developed by the turbine and hence an improvement in gas turbine performance occurs when natural gas is used. The improvement in performance depends on the fuel gas composition. An increase in power output and thermal efficiency of about 1 to 2 per cent is possible when operating with natural gas compared with diesel.

In this simulator, about 1 per cent increase in engine performance was obtained when the switch was made from diesel oil to natural gas and the reader is left to demonstrate this effect of the change in fuel on engine performance.

The effect of switching from natural gas to diesel fuel has a significant impact on engine emissions, as shown in Fig. 14.29.

At a power turbine of 70% speed, which corresponds to a power turbine 2100 RPM, the power output decreases by about 11%, hence illustrating the importance of the power turbine performance. At high power turbine speeds, there is little variation of power turbine efficiency with the power turbine non-dimensional speed, thus resulting in a relatively flat power curve when operating at these speeds. It will therefore be necessary for our loads to operate at relatively high speeds or a very flat power turbine curve will be required if a significant loss in power is not to be incurred at low power turbine speeds (similar in shape to the curve describing the 85% GG speed in Fig. 14.26). The figure also shows the effect of the gas generator speed on power output. There is a loss in power output at lower gas generator speeds due to the reduction in air mass flow and turbine entry temperature and generally in pressure ratio (i.e. reduced gas power).

14.27 Variation of gas turbine efficiency with power output for different power turbine speeds.

The variation of the gas turbine thermal efficiency with power output for different power turbine speeds is shown in Fig. 14.27. The decrease in thermal efficiency with power for a given power turbine speed is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed, resulting in lower compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. However, for a given power output, the thermal efficiency improves with the increase in power turbine speed and this is due.

# 404 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

to the improvement in the power turbine efficiency. At high power turbine speeds (around 3000 RPM), there is only a small variation in the thermal efficiency with the power turbine speed and this is due to minimal variation in power turbine efficiency at these speeds. Thus the loss in performance in the power turbine at low speeds is responsible for the low thermal efficiency at these power turbine speeds.

Furthermore, gas turbines are most efficient at high load conditions and, if a significant turndown in power is required, it is best to employ two smaller engines, where each engine operates near its design condition at any given load condition. This is the principle of Combination Of Gas turbine Or Gas turbine (COGOG)/Combination Of Gas turbine And Gas turbine (COGAG) where one engine is used at low powers and either or both engines operate at higher power requirements.

The principle of COGOG and COGAG is often used in naval applications where the cruise speed of the ship is about half the boost speed. Due to the propeller law, which states that the power required is proportional to the cube of the speed, the cruise power requirement is only about 12.5% of the boost power requirements. At such low powers, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine will be very poor. The thermal efficiency at cruise conditions is improved by employing a smaller gas turbine to operate at cruise conditions and switching to a larger gas turbine for boost conditions. The power output of the cruise gas turbine is about 30% of the total propulsive power requirement. It is worth noting that naval ships spend a significant time (about 95%) at cruise conditions.

For naval applications, the use of a variable pitch propeller would enable the power turbine speed to be varied independently of the power requirements. By employing a variable pitch propeller, it would be possible to operate at the maximum thermal efficiency for a given gas generator speed resulting in a useful improvement in thermal efficiency, particularly at low power operation, typical of cruise conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.28, where the gas turbine thermal efficiency is displayed as a function of power turbine speed for different gas generator speeds. The figure shows the load lines for a fixed pitch propeller and also for an electrical generator. The optimum line indicates what could be achieved by using a variable pitch propeller for naval propulsion. At low power, a 4% improvement in thermal efficiency may be possible using a variable pitch propeller and this corresponds to a significant reduction in fuel cost.

Note that the exhaust gas composition has changed in that the amount of CO2 has increased and the amount of H2O has decreased when.

Diesel fuel is employed. The decrease in H2O results in a decrease in the specific heat of the products of combustion, cp. However, the impact of the isentropic index, γ = cp/cv, is small when changing from natural gas to diesel. The isentropic index, γ, relates to cp by the expression 1/γ = 1 – R/cp, where R = Ro/MW is the gas constant of the products of combustion, and Ro and MW are the universal gas constant and molecular weight, respectively. An increase in R when operating with natural gas is due to its lower molecular weight compared with diesel fuel, but this is compensated by the increase in cp. Hence only a small change in γ occurs when switching from natural gas to diesel. However, the increase in cp results in an increase in the power developed by the turbine and hence an improvement in gas turbine performance occurs when natural gas is used. The improvement in performance depends on the fuel gas composition. An increase in power output and thermal efficiency of about 1 to 2 per cent is possible when operating with natural gas compared with diesel.

In this simulator, about 1 per cent increase in engine performance was obtained when the switch was made from diesel oil to natural gas and the reader is left to demonstrate this effect of the change in fuel on engine performance.

The effect of switching from natural gas to diesel fuel has a significant impact on engine emissions, as shown in Fig. 14.29.

The power turbine speed (mechanical speed) is determined by the driven load, and therefore the driven load has a direct impact on the power turbine non-dimensional speed.

In our simulator, it has been assumed that the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which requires the power turbine speed to remain constant with the change in load to maintain the required frequency. However, in other cases such as mechanical drive applications (process compressors and pumps), the speed of the process compressor may be low during dense phase operation due to high suction pressures in the process compressor. The process compressor speed and therefore the power turbine speed may be as low as 70% of the rated (100%) speed. Hence it is important to determine the power output of the gas turbine at different power turbine speeds.

14.27 Variation of gas turbine efficiency with power output for different power turbine speeds.

The variation of the gas turbine thermal efficiency with power output for different power turbine speeds is shown in Fig. 14.27. The decrease in thermal efficiency with power for a given power turbine speed is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed, resulting in lower compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. However, for a given power output, the thermal efficiency improves with the increase in power turbine speed and this is due.

# 404 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

to the improvement in the power turbine efficiency. At high power turbine speeds (around 3000 RPM), there is only a small variation in the thermal efficiency with the power turbine speed and this is due to minimal variation in power turbine efficiency at these speeds. Thus the loss in performance in the power turbine at low speeds is responsible for the low thermal efficiency at these power turbine speeds.

Furthermore, gas turbines are most efficient at high load conditions and, if a significant turndown in power is required, it is best to employ two smaller engines, where each engine operates near its design condition at any given load condition. This is the principle of Combination Of Gas turbine Or Gas turbine (COGOG)/Combination Of Gas turbine And Gas turbine (COGAG) where one engine is used at low powers and either or both engines operate at higher power requirements.

The principle of COGOG and COGAG is often used in naval applications where the cruise speed of the ship is about half the boost speed. Due to the propeller law, which states that the power required is proportional to the cube of the speed, the cruise power requirement is only about 12.5% of the boost power requirements. At such low powers, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine will be very poor. The thermal efficiency at cruise conditions is improved by employing a smaller gas turbine to operate at cruise conditions and switching to a larger gas turbine for boost conditions. The power output of the cruise gas turbine is about 30% of the total propulsive power requirement. It is worth noting that naval ships spend a significant time (about 95%) at cruise conditions.

For naval applications, the use of a variable pitch propeller would enable the power turbine speed to be varied independently of the power requirements. By employing a variable pitch propeller, it would be possible to operate at the maximum thermal efficiency for a given gas generator speed resulting in a useful improvement in thermal efficiency, particularly at low power operation, typical of cruise conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.28, where the gas turbine thermal efficiency is displayed as a function of power turbine speed for different gas generator speeds. The figure shows the load lines for a fixed pitch propeller and also for an electrical generator. The optimum line indicates what could be achieved by using a variable pitch propeller for naval propulsion. At low power, a 4% improvement in thermal efficiency may be possible using a variable pitch propeller and this corresponds to a significant reduction in fuel cost.

The impact of the change in fuel from natural gas to diesel on gas turbine performance will now be considered. Table 14.1 shows the tabulated output of the exhaust gas composition as mole percentages when the gas turbine is operating with natural gas. Table 14.2 shows the tabulated output for the case when the gas turbine is operating with diesel fuel. Note that the exhaust gas composition has changed in that the amount of CO2 has increased and the amount of H2O has decreased when.

Diesel fuel is employed. The decrease in H2O results in a decrease in the specific heat of the products of combustion, cp. However, the impact of the isentropic index, γ = cp/cv, is small when changing from natural gas to diesel. The isentropic index, γ, relates to cp by the expression 1/γ = 1 – R/cp, where R = Ro/MW is the gas constant of the products of combustion, and Ro and MW are the universal gas constant and molecular weight, respectively. An increase in R when operating with natural gas is due to its lower molecular weight compared with diesel fuel, but this is compensated by the increase in cp. Hence only a small change in γ occurs when switching from natural gas to diesel. However, the increase in cp results in an increase in the power developed by the turbine and hence an improvement in gas turbine performance occurs when natural gas is used. The improvement in performance depends on the fuel gas composition. An increase in power output and thermal efficiency of about 1 to 2 per cent is possible when operating with natural gas compared with diesel.

In this simulator, about 1 per cent increase in engine performance was obtained when the switch was made from diesel oil to natural gas and the reader is left to demonstrate this effect of the change in fuel on engine performance.

The effect of switching from natural gas to diesel fuel has a significant impact on engine emissions, as shown in Fig. 14.29. ",What changes occur in exhaust gas composition when switching from natural gas to diesel fuel in a gas turbine?,The amount of CO2 increases and the amount of H2O decreases when diesel fuel is used instead of natural gas.,Switching to diesel fuel results in higher CO2 and lower H2O levels in the exhaust gas compared to natural gas.,Diesel fuel usage leads to an increase in CO2 and a decrease in H2O in the exhaust gas composition.,Exhaust gas composition shifts to more CO2 and less H2O when the fuel is changed from natural gas to diesel.,"When diesel replaces natural gas, the exhaust gas shows elevated CO2 and reduced H2O concentrations."

For a given power turbine pressure ratio, the efficiency is dependent on the non-dimensional speed of the turbine, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The power turbine speed (mechanical speed) is determined by the driven load, and therefore the driven load has a direct impact on the power turbine non-dimensional speed.

In our simulator, it has been assumed that the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which requires the power turbine speed to remain constant with the change in load to maintain the required frequency. However, in other cases such as mechanical drive applications (process compressors and pumps), the speed of the process compressor may be low during dense phase operation due to high suction pressures in the process compressor. The process compressor speed and therefore the power turbine speed may be as low as 70% of the rated (100%) speed. Hence it is important to determine the power output of the gas turbine at different power turbine speeds.

Figure 14.26 shows the variation of the power developed by the power turbine with power turbine speed at ISO conditions and zero inlet and exhaust losses. The power output has been drawn for different gas generator speeds and of particular interest is the 100% gas generator (GG) speed, as this situation normally corresponds to the maximum gas power generated by the gas generator. At a power turbine of 70% speed, which corresponds to a power turbine 2100 RPM, the power output decreases by about 11%, hence illustrating the importance of the power turbine performance. At high power turbine speeds, there is little variation of power turbine efficiency with the power turbine non-dimensional speed, thus resulting in a relatively flat power curve when operating at these speeds. It will therefore be necessary for our loads to operate at relatively high speeds or a very flat power turbine curve will be required if a significant loss in power is not to be incurred at low power turbine speeds (similar in shape to the curve describing the 85% GG speed in Fig. 14.26). The figure also shows the effect of the gas generator speed on power output. There is a loss in power output at lower gas generator speeds due to the reduction in air mass flow and turbine entry temperature and generally in pressure ratio (i.e. reduced gas power).

By employing a variable pitch propeller, it would be possible to operate at the maximum thermal efficiency for a given gas generator speed resulting in a useful improvement in thermal efficiency, particularly at low power operation, typical of cruise conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.28, where the gas turbine thermal efficiency is displayed as a function of power turbine speed for different gas generator speeds. The figure shows the load lines for a fixed pitch propeller and also for an electrical generator. The optimum line indicates what could be achieved by using a variable pitch propeller for naval propulsion. At low power, a 4% improvement in thermal efficiency may be possible using a variable pitch propeller and this corresponds to a significant reduction in fuel cost.

operate on a range of fuels, which include liquid fuels such as diesel, kerosene, naphtha, crude oil and residual fuels. This simulator can operate on either natural gas, methane or diesel fuel. The impact of the change in fuel from natural gas to diesel on gas turbine performance will now be considered. Table 14.1 shows the tabulated output of the exhaust gas composition as mole percentages when the gas turbine is operating with natural gas. Table 14.2 shows the tabulated output for the case when the gas turbine is operating with diesel fuel. Note that the exhaust gas composition has changed in that the amount of CO2 has increased and the amount of H2O has decreased when.

Diesel fuel is employed. The decrease in H2O results in a decrease in the specific heat of the products of combustion, cp. However, the impact of the isentropic index, γ = cp/cv, is small when changing from natural gas to diesel. The isentropic index, γ, relates to cp by the expression 1/γ = 1 – R/cp, where R = Ro/MW is the gas constant of the products of combustion, and Ro and MW are the universal gas constant and molecular weight, respectively. An increase in R when operating with natural gas is due to its lower molecular weight compared with diesel fuel, but this is compensated by the increase in cp. Hence only a small change in γ occurs when switching from natural gas to diesel. However, the increase in cp results in an increase in the power developed by the turbine and hence an improvement in gas turbine performance occurs when natural gas is used. The improvement in performance depends on the fuel gas composition. An increase in power output and thermal efficiency of about 1 to 2 per cent is possible when operating with natural gas compared with diesel.

In this simulator, about 1 per cent increase in engine performance was obtained when the switch was made from diesel oil to natural gas and the reader is left to demonstrate this effect of the change in fuel on engine performance.

The effect of switching from natural gas to diesel fuel has a significant impact on engine emissions, as shown in Fig. 14.29. ","What is the significance of the isentropic index, γ, in gas turbine performance when changing fuels?","The isentropic index, γ, relates to cp by the expression 1/γ = 1 – R/cp. Only a small change in γ occurs when switching from natural gas to diesel due to compensatory changes in cp and R.","γ, defined by 1/γ = 1 – R/cp, experiences minimal change between natural gas and diesel, as adjustments in cp and R offset each other.","Changing fuels affects γ slightly because variations in cp and R balance out, keeping γ relatively stable.","The isentropic index γ remains largely unchanged when fuels are switched, thanks to compensating changes in cp and R.","γ sees little variation with fuel change, as the effects on cp and R counteract each other, maintaining γ's value."
