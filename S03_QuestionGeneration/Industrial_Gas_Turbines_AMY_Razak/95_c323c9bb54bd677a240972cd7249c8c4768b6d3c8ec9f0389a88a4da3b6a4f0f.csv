Also, the potential exists for corrosion of hot sections and therefore increased maintenance costs. The heat absorbed by the water also results in increased fuel consumption. Although there is an increase in power output, the net effect is a reduction in thermal efficiency.

In spite of these drawbacks, water injection is used for NOₓ suppression because, for many years, water injection was the most effective means to suppress NOₓ emissions substantially. In fact, about 35% of industrial gas turbines currently employ water injection for NOₓ suppression. When such engines use liquid fuels, water injection is probably the most effective means of NOₓ control. Operators also use water injection for power augmentation. Although there is a loss in thermal efficiency, the increased power output is worthwhile in terms of increased production and revenue.

Steam injection has a similar impact in reducing NOₓ but the impact on thermal efficiency is more favourable because the latent heat of evaporation is normally supplied from the turbine exhaust heat. However, NOₓ suppression using water injection is greater.

# 6.10 Selective catalytic reduction (SCR)

Another means of reducing gas turbine emissions is to employ selective catalytic reduction. SCR converts NOₓ into nitrogen by injecting ammonia into the exhaust stream in the presence of a catalyst. The CO and UHC are also removed by using an oxidation catalyst to convert these emissions into CO₂ and water vapour.

The NOₓ levels may be first reduced by using water or steam injection to reduce the NOₓ levels to about 30 ppmv, and SCR then reduces them further to about 10 ppmv. SCR systems are quite complex and work when the exhaust gas temperature is within a fairly narrow band ranging from 550 K to about 700 K. Therefore, SCR is normally restricted to applications where exhaust heat recovery is applicable, such as combined heat and power or combined cycle power plants. However, in simple-cycle power plants where no heat recovery is accomplished, high temperature catalysts (e.g. Zeolite), which can operate at temperatures up to 870K, are an option.

Methods of reducing emissions using water/steam injection and SCR methods have been discussed and their drawbacks highlighted. What is desirable is to achieve low emissions by controlling the combustion temperature. The effect

of primary zone fuel–air ratio on NOₓ is shown in Fig. 6.24. The figure also shows the regions of fuel–air ratio where conventional (diffusion) combustion occurs giving high NOₓ emissions and regions of low fuel–air ratio where NOₓ formation is low, which is close to the lean extinction limit. The variation of NOₓ with primary zone temperature, which is influenced by the primary zone fuel–air ratio, is illustrated in Fig. 6.25. The figure also shows the required operating range for low emissions.

# 160 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

For a small range of primary zone temperatures, approximately between 1700 K and 1900 K, the NOx and CO emissions are less than 25 ppmv. The principle behind combustors designed for low emissions is to maintain the primary zone temperature within these limits. This can be achieved if the primary zone fuel–air ratio is kept reasonably constant as the engine load varies.

# 6.12 Variable geometry combustor

A constant primary zone fuel–air ratio can be achieved as the load is reduced by diverting part of the primary zone air to the dilution zone by means of some variable geometry. This action maintains a constant primary zone temperature and low emissions. Figure 6.26 shows a schematic representation of a variable geometry combustor. The primary zone airflow is controlled by the variable geometry flow controller as the fuel flow changes, so maintaining a constant primary zone fuel–air ratio and thereby maintaining low emissions. Variable geometry has been used in large industrial gas turbines, but its reliability has proved to be a problem with smaller gas turbines.

# 6.13 Staged combustion

The problems presented by the variable geometry combustors have led to the development of the staged combustor. The variable geometry combustor controls the combustion temperature within the limits where low emissions occur by controlling or maintaining the fuel–air ratio as the engine load changes. This is achieved by switching combustion air from one zone (primary zone) to another (dilution zone) as the load changes. In staged combustion, the airflow distribution between zones is unaltered but the fuel flow is switched from one zone to another.

# Gas turbine combustion

To obtain the same flexibility as variable geometry combustion systems, staged combustors will require many stages, which is impractical. In practice, however, staged combustors seldom exceed three stages. Two arrangements of staged combustion are possible and are referred to as parallel and series staging. Figure 6.27 shows a schematic representation of these two staged combustion systems.

The first stage is active at low power operation and both stages are active at high power settings. The main advantage of the parallel staging system is that the combustion system length is shorter compared with the series staging system. The series staging system often uses a radial inward arrangement to overcome the increased length but the combustion flow path can be tortuous, as shown in Fig. 6.28.

The main disadvantage of the parallel staging system is that the combustion air temperature for all the stages corresponds to the compressor discharge temperature, resulting in a poor lean extinction limit. Also, at low power settings, the lower temperature of the second stage may ‘chill’ the combustion in the first stage resulting in increased amounts of CO and UHC.

# 162 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Staging systems often employ combustion air bleeds to control the fuel–air ratio, thus preventing the increase in CO and UHC. These bleeds are normally dumped overboard and result in a loss in gas turbine performance.

Series staging has a lower lean extinction limit because the first stage acts as a pilot for the second (main) stage and the hot gases from the first stage act as a reliable ignition source for the second stage. Also, the flow of hot gases from the pilot stage into the main stage ensures good combustion efficiency even at very low equivalence ratios. However, as the second stage combustion temperature starts to fall with engine load, CO will start to rise and bleeds as discussed for parallel staging may be required. By increasing the first stage temperature (higher equivalence ratio) at low loads, the CO may be reduced without having to use combustion bleeds.

# 6.13.1 DLE combustors for industrial gas turbines

The above description of staged combustion has found application in aero-derived gas turbines. There are a significant number of industrial designs, which have adapted a different approach and achieve low emission combustion effectively in a single stage. These engines are of the single shaft type and often employ a variable inlet guide vane to maintain approximately constant fuel–air ratio, as discussed in Section 6.17. A notable design developed by ABB/Alstom is the EV burner, 5 which uses two half cones, shifted to form two air slots of constant width 6 as shown in Fig. 6.29. Gaseous fuels are injected into the combustion air by means of fuel distribution tubes consisting of two rows of small holes perpendicular to the inlet ports of the swirler. The fuel and air is completely mixed shortly after injection. The swirl mixture of fuel and air then flows into the flame zone. The breakdown of the swirling flow at the outlet of the burner results in flame stabilisation in free space just downstream of the burner. During start-up, the EV burner is piloted by fuel supplied to a central fuel nozzle in the tip of the cone through a lance leading to a diffusion type flame. Other manufacturers such as General Electric have also designed DLE for their industrial gas turbines and these are described by Davis and Washam.7

# 6.14 Rich-burn, quick-quench, lean-burn (RQL) combustor

Series staging lends itself well to RQL combustion. The first stage operates at a high equivalence ratio of about 1.5. ",What are the drawbacks of using water injection for NOₓ suppression in gas turbines?,"The drawbacks include increased operating costs due to water treatment, potential corrosion of hot sections leading to higher maintenance costs, increased fuel consumption because of the heat absorbed by water, and a reduction in thermal efficiency despite increased power output.","Increased operating and maintenance costs, higher fuel consumption, and reduced thermal efficiency are the main drawbacks of water injection for NOₓ suppression.","Water injection leads to higher costs (operating and maintenance), more fuel use, and lower thermal efficiency, even though it boosts power output.","Despite its effectiveness in NOₓ suppression, water injection raises operational costs, risks corrosion, increases fuel usage, and diminishes thermal efficiency.","The cons of water injection for NOₓ control encompass elevated expenses, corrosion risks, additional fuel consumption, and a drop in thermal efficiency."

The primary zone airflow is controlled by the variable geometry flow controller as the fuel flow changes, so maintaining a constant primary zone fuel–air ratio and thereby maintaining low emissions. Variable geometry has been used in large industrial gas turbines, but its reliability has proved to be a problem with smaller gas turbines.

# 6.13 Staged combustion

The problems presented by the variable geometry combustors have led to the development of the staged combustor. The variable geometry combustor controls the combustion temperature within the limits where low emissions occur by controlling or maintaining the fuel–air ratio as the engine load changes. This is achieved by switching combustion air from one zone (primary zone) to another (dilution zone) as the load changes. In staged combustion, the airflow distribution between zones is unaltered but the fuel flow is switched from one zone to another.

# Gas turbine combustion

To obtain the same flexibility as variable geometry combustion systems, staged combustors will require many stages, which is impractical. In practice, however, staged combustors seldom exceed three stages. Two arrangements of staged combustion are possible and are referred to as parallel and series staging. Figure 6.27 shows a schematic representation of these two staged combustion systems.

The first stage is active at low power operation and both stages are active at high power settings. The main advantage of the parallel staging system is that the combustion system length is shorter compared with the series staging system. The series staging system often uses a radial inward arrangement to overcome the increased length but the combustion flow path can be tortuous, as shown in Fig. 6.28.

The main disadvantage of the parallel staging system is that the combustion air temperature for all the stages corresponds to the compressor discharge temperature, resulting in a poor lean extinction limit. Also, at low power settings, the lower temperature of the second stage may ‘chill’ the combustion in the first stage resulting in increased amounts of CO and UHC.

# 162 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Staging systems often employ combustion air bleeds to control the fuel–air ratio, thus preventing the increase in CO and UHC. These bleeds are normally dumped overboard and result in a loss in gas turbine performance.

Series staging has a lower lean extinction limit because the first stage acts as a pilot for the second (main) stage and the hot gases from the first stage act as a reliable ignition source for the second stage. Also, the flow of hot gases from the pilot stage into the main stage ensures good combustion efficiency even at very low equivalence ratios. However, as the second stage combustion temperature starts to fall with engine load, CO will start to rise and bleeds as discussed for parallel staging may be required. By increasing the first stage temperature (higher equivalence ratio) at low loads, the CO may be reduced without having to use combustion bleeds.

# 6.13.1 DLE combustors for industrial gas turbines

The above description of staged combustion has found application in aero-derived gas turbines. There are a significant number of industrial designs, which have adapted a different approach and achieve low emission combustion effectively in a single stage. These engines are of the single shaft type and often employ a variable inlet guide vane to maintain approximately constant fuel–air ratio, as discussed in Section 6.17. A notable design developed by ABB/Alstom is the EV burner, 5 which uses two half cones, shifted to form two air slots of constant width 6 as shown in Fig. 6.29. Gaseous fuels are injected into the combustion air by means of fuel distribution tubes consisting of two rows of small holes perpendicular to the inlet ports of the swirler. The fuel and air is completely mixed shortly after injection. The swirl mixture of fuel and air then flows into the flame zone. The breakdown of the swirling flow at the outlet of the burner results in flame stabilisation in free space just downstream of the burner. During start-up, the EV burner is piloted by fuel supplied to a central fuel nozzle in the tip of the cone through a lance leading to a diffusion type flame. Other manufacturers such as General Electric have also designed DLE for their industrial gas turbines and these are described by Davis and Washam.7

Series staging lends itself well to RQL combustion. The first stage operates at a high equivalence ratio of about 1.5. ",What is selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and how does it reduce NOₓ emissions?,"SCR is a method that converts NOₓ into nitrogen by injecting ammonia into the exhaust stream in the presence of a catalyst, also removing CO and UHC through oxidation into CO₂ and water vapor.","By injecting ammonia into the exhaust with a catalyst, SCR transforms NOₓ into nitrogen, while an oxidation catalyst turns CO and UHC into CO₂ and water vapor.","SCR reduces NOₓ emissions by using ammonia and a catalyst to produce nitrogen, and it oxidizes CO and UHC into less harmful substances.","The process involves ammonia injection and catalytic conversion to nitrogen for NOₓ, plus oxidation of CO and UHC into CO₂ and water vapor.","Through catalytic reactions with ammonia, SCR effectively lowers NOₓ levels and converts other pollutants into CO₂ and water vapor."

Also, the potential exists for corrosion of hot sections and therefore increased maintenance costs. The heat absorbed by the water also results in increased fuel consumption. Although there is an increase in power output, the net effect is a reduction in thermal efficiency.

In spite of these drawbacks, water injection is used for NOₓ suppression because, for many years, water injection was the most effective means to suppress NOₓ emissions substantially. In fact, about 35% of industrial gas turbines currently employ water injection for NOₓ suppression. When such engines use liquid fuels, water injection is probably the most effective means of NOₓ control. Operators also use water injection for power augmentation. Although there is a loss in thermal efficiency, the increased power output is worthwhile in terms of increased production and revenue.

Steam injection has a similar impact in reducing NOₓ but the impact on thermal efficiency is more favourable because the latent heat of evaporation is normally supplied from the turbine exhaust heat. However, NOₓ suppression using water injection is greater.

# 6.10 Selective catalytic reduction (SCR)

Another means of reducing gas turbine emissions is to employ selective catalytic reduction. SCR converts NOₓ into nitrogen by injecting ammonia into the exhaust stream in the presence of a catalyst. The CO and UHC are also removed by using an oxidation catalyst to convert these emissions into CO₂ and water vapour.

The NOₓ levels may be first reduced by using water or steam injection to reduce the NOₓ levels to about 30 ppmv, and SCR then reduces them further to about 10 ppmv. SCR systems are quite complex and work when the exhaust gas temperature is within a fairly narrow band ranging from 550 K to about 700 K. Therefore, SCR is normally restricted to applications where exhaust heat recovery is applicable, such as combined heat and power or combined cycle power plants. However, in simple-cycle power plants where no heat recovery is accomplished, high temperature catalysts (e.g. Zeolite), which can operate at temperatures up to 870K, are an option.

The figure also shows the regions of fuel–air ratio where conventional (diffusion) combustion occurs giving high NOₓ emissions and regions of low fuel–air ratio where NOₓ formation is low, which is close to the lean extinction limit.

For a small range of primary zone temperatures, approximately between 1700 K and 1900 K, the NOx and CO emissions are less than 25 ppmv. The principle behind combustors designed for low emissions is to maintain the primary zone temperature within these limits. This can be achieved if the primary zone fuel–air ratio is kept reasonably constant as the engine load varies.

Also, the potential exists for corrosion of hot sections and therefore increased maintenance costs. The heat absorbed by the water also results in increased fuel consumption. Although there is an increase in power output, the net effect is a reduction in thermal efficiency.

In spite of these drawbacks, water injection is used for NOₓ suppression because, for many years, water injection was the most effective means to suppress NOₓ emissions substantially. In fact, about 35% of industrial gas turbines currently employ water injection for NOₓ suppression. When such engines use liquid fuels, water injection is probably the most effective means of NOₓ control. Operators also use water injection for power augmentation. Although there is a loss in thermal efficiency, the increased power output is worthwhile in terms of increased production and revenue.

Steam injection has a similar impact in reducing NOₓ but the impact on thermal efficiency is more favourable because the latent heat of evaporation is normally supplied from the turbine exhaust heat. However, NOₓ suppression using water injection is greater.

# 6.10 Selective catalytic reduction (SCR)

Another means of reducing gas turbine emissions is to employ selective catalytic reduction. SCR converts NOₓ into nitrogen by injecting ammonia into the exhaust stream in the presence of a catalyst. The CO and UHC are also removed by using an oxidation catalyst to convert these emissions into CO₂ and water vapour.

The NOₓ levels may be first reduced by using water or steam injection to reduce the NOₓ levels to about 30 ppmv, and SCR then reduces them further to about 10 ppmv. SCR systems are quite complex and work when the exhaust gas temperature is within a fairly narrow band ranging from 550 K to about 700 K. Therefore, SCR is normally restricted to applications where exhaust heat recovery is applicable, such as combined heat and power or combined cycle power plants. However, in simple-cycle power plants where no heat recovery is accomplished, high temperature catalysts (e.g. Zeolite), which can operate at temperatures up to 870K, are an option.

Methods of reducing emissions using water/steam injection and SCR methods have been discussed and their drawbacks highlighted. What is desirable is to achieve low emissions by controlling the combustion temperature. The effect

of primary zone fuel–air ratio on NOₓ is shown in Fig. 6.24. The figure also shows the regions of fuel–air ratio where conventional (diffusion) combustion occurs giving high NOₓ emissions and regions of low fuel–air ratio where NOₓ formation is low, which is close to the lean extinction limit. The variation of NOₓ with primary zone temperature, which is influenced by the primary zone fuel–air ratio, is illustrated in Fig. 6.25. The figure also shows the required operating range for low emissions.

# 160 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

For a small range of primary zone temperatures, approximately between 1700 K and 1900 K, the NOx and CO emissions are less than 25 ppmv. The principle behind combustors designed for low emissions is to maintain the primary zone temperature within these limits. This can be achieved if the primary zone fuel–air ratio is kept reasonably constant as the engine load varies.

# 6.12 Variable geometry combustor

A constant primary zone fuel–air ratio can be achieved as the load is reduced by diverting part of the primary zone air to the dilution zone by means of some variable geometry. This action maintains a constant primary zone temperature and low emissions. Figure 6.26 shows a schematic representation of a variable geometry combustor. The primary zone airflow is controlled by the variable geometry flow controller as the fuel flow changes, so maintaining a constant primary zone fuel–air ratio and thereby maintaining low emissions. Variable geometry has been used in large industrial gas turbines, but its reliability has proved to be a problem with smaller gas turbines.

# 6.13 Staged combustion

The problems presented by the variable geometry combustors have led to the development of the staged combustor. The variable geometry combustor controls the combustion temperature within the limits where low emissions occur by controlling or maintaining the fuel–air ratio as the engine load changes. This is achieved by switching combustion air from one zone (primary zone) to another (dilution zone) as the load changes. In staged combustion, the airflow distribution between zones is unaltered but the fuel flow is switched from one zone to another.

# Gas turbine combustion

To obtain the same flexibility as variable geometry combustion systems, staged combustors will require many stages, which is impractical. In practice, however, staged combustors seldom exceed three stages. Two arrangements of staged combustion are possible and are referred to as parallel and series staging. Figure 6.27 shows a schematic representation of these two staged combustion systems.

The first stage is active at low power operation and both stages are active at high power settings. The main advantage of the parallel staging system is that the combustion system length is shorter compared with the series staging system. The series staging system often uses a radial inward arrangement to overcome the increased length but the combustion flow path can be tortuous, as shown in Fig. 6.28.

The main disadvantage of the parallel staging system is that the combustion air temperature for all the stages corresponds to the compressor discharge temperature, resulting in a poor lean extinction limit. Also, at low power settings, the lower temperature of the second stage may ‘chill’ the combustion in the first stage resulting in increased amounts of CO and UHC.

# 162 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Staging systems often employ combustion air bleeds to control the fuel–air ratio, thus preventing the increase in CO and UHC. These bleeds are normally dumped overboard and result in a loss in gas turbine performance.

Series staging has a lower lean extinction limit because the first stage acts as a pilot for the second (main) stage and the hot gases from the first stage act as a reliable ignition source for the second stage. Also, the flow of hot gases from the pilot stage into the main stage ensures good combustion efficiency even at very low equivalence ratios. However, as the second stage combustion temperature starts to fall with engine load, CO will start to rise and bleeds as discussed for parallel staging may be required. By increasing the first stage temperature (higher equivalence ratio) at low loads, the CO may be reduced without having to use combustion bleeds.

# 6.13.1 DLE combustors for industrial gas turbines

The above description of staged combustion has found application in aero-derived gas turbines. There are a significant number of industrial designs, which have adapted a different approach and achieve low emission combustion effectively in a single stage. These engines are of the single shaft type and often employ a variable inlet guide vane to maintain approximately constant fuel–air ratio, as discussed in Section 6.17. A notable design developed by ABB/Alstom is the EV burner, 5 which uses two half cones, shifted to form two air slots of constant width 6 as shown in Fig. 6.29. Gaseous fuels are injected into the combustion air by means of fuel distribution tubes consisting of two rows of small holes perpendicular to the inlet ports of the swirler. The fuel and air is completely mixed shortly after injection. The swirl mixture of fuel and air then flows into the flame zone. The breakdown of the swirling flow at the outlet of the burner results in flame stabilisation in free space just downstream of the burner. During start-up, the EV burner is piloted by fuel supplied to a central fuel nozzle in the tip of the cone through a lance leading to a diffusion type flame.
