The process involves the injection of ammonia into the exhaust stream in the presence of a catalyst. Here’s how it works:

1. **Injection of Ammonia**: Ammonia is injected into the exhaust gases emitted from the gas turbine.

2. **Catalytic Reaction**: The ammonia reacts with the NOₓ in the presence of a catalyst, which facilitates the conversion of NOₓ into nitrogen (N₂), a harmless gas.

3. **Additional Emission Control**: Alongside the reduction of NOₓ, the SCR system also employs an oxidation catalyst to convert carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapor.

4. **Preliminary NOₓ Reduction**: Prior to the SCR process, the NOₓ levels can be reduced using water or steam injection. This initial step can lower the NOₓ concentration to about 30 parts per million by volume (ppmv).

5. **Further Reduction**: The SCR system then further reduces the NOₓ levels from approximately 30 ppmv to about 10 ppmv.

6. **Operational Conditions**: SCR systems operate effectively when the exhaust gas temperature is maintained within a specific range, typically between 550 K and 700 K. In applications where exhaust heat recovery is possible, such as combined heat and power or combined cycle power plants, SCR is commonly used. For simple-cycle power plants, high-temperature catalysts (like Zeolite) that can function at temperatures up to 870 K may be utilized.

Overall, SCR is a complex but effective method for significantly reducing NOₓ emissions from gas turbines, contributing to cleaner air and compliance with environmental regulations."

The hot gases produced by the first stage provide a reliable ignition source for the second stage, ensuring good combustion efficiency even at very low equivalence ratios. However, as the combustion temperature in the second stage decreases with engine load, the potential for carbon monoxide (CO) emissions to rise increases, which may necessitate the use of combustion air bleeds to maintain emissions control. In contrast, the parallel staging system does not have this pilot stage effect, which can lead to a higher lean extinction limit."

A higher equivalence ratio means that there is more fuel relative to the amount of air, which can lead to more complete combustion. This is important because incomplete combustion is a primary cause of CO emissions. 

When the first stage operates at a higher temperature, it acts as a pilot for the second stage, providing hot gases that promote efficient combustion. This ensures that even at low engine loads, the combustion efficiency remains high, which helps to minimize the production of CO. Additionally, by maintaining a higher temperature in the first stage, the need for combustion air bleeds to control emissions can be reduced, further enhancing overall gas turbine performance and efficiency."

As engine load decreases, the combustion temperature in the second stage of a series staging system tends to fall. This reduction in temperature can lead to an increase in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, necessitating the use of combustion bleeds to control the fuel–air ratio and prevent further increases in CO and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC).

In contrast, in a parallel staging system, the combustion air temperature for all stages corresponds to the compressor discharge temperature, which can also result in a poor lean extinction limit at low power settings. The lower temperature of the second stage may 'chill' the combustion in the first stage, potentially increasing CO and UHC emissions. To mitigate these issues, combustion bleeds may be required to maintain an appropriate fuel–air ratio and ensure efficient combustion.

Overall, as engine load decreases, the likelihood of requiring combustion bleeds increases in both series and parallel staging systems to manage emissions effectively."

Unlike variable geometry combustors, which adjust the airflow to maintain a constant fuel–air ratio, staged combustors keep the airflow distribution between the primary and dilution zones unchanged. Instead, they manage the fuel flow, directing it from one zone to another based on the engine load. This allows the combustion system to adapt to varying loads while aiming to maintain low emissions. The first stage typically operates at low power, while both stages are active at higher power settings, ensuring efficient combustion across different operational conditions."

1. **Increased Pressure Drop**: The complex flow path can create resistance, resulting in a higher pressure drop across the combustion system, which can negatively affect overall efficiency.

2. **Uneven Temperature Distribution**: The tortuous path may lead to uneven heating of the combustion gases, which can affect combustion stability and efficiency.

3. **Increased Emissions**: If the flow path causes incomplete combustion or poor mixing of fuel and air, it can result in higher emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC).

4. **Potential for Flame Stability Issues**: The complexity of the flow path may lead to difficulties in maintaining stable flame conditions, particularly at varying loads.

5. **Maintenance Challenges**: The intricate design may complicate maintenance and inspection processes, making it harder to identify and address issues that arise within the combustion system.

Overall, these challenges can impact the performance and reliability of the gas turbine system."

Maintaining the primary zone temperature within specific limits is essential for achieving low emissions. This is primarily accomplished by keeping the primary zone fuel–air ratio reasonably constant as the engine load varies. When the primary zone temperature is controlled effectively, it helps to minimize the production of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). 

In systems like variable geometry combustors and staged combustors, the management of airflow and fuel distribution between different combustion zones is designed to maintain this constant primary zone temperature, thereby ensuring that emissions remain low. If the primary zone temperature is not properly controlled, it can lead to increased emissions as the combustion process becomes less efficient."

By implementing a two-stage combustion system, as seen in aero-derived gas turbines, the first stage can operate at a higher equivalence ratio to maintain efficient combustion even under low load conditions. This approach ensures that the flow of hot gases from the pilot stage into the main stage supports good combustion efficiency. If CO levels begin to rise as the second stage temperature drops, adjustments can be made, such as increasing the first stage temperature, to mitigate CO emissions without resorting to combustion bleeds.

Additionally, designs like the ABB/Alstom EV burner demonstrate how staged combustion can be effectively achieved in a single stage by utilizing variable inlet guide vanes and innovative fuel injection methods. This allows for a consistent fuel-air ratio and thorough mixing of fuel and air, leading to improved flame stability and reduced emissions.

Overall, the application of staged combustion principles in gas turbines enhances combustion efficiency by allowing for better control of combustion conditions, optimizing fuel-air mixing, and reducing harmful emissions."
