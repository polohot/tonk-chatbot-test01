When operating at low power, compressor fouling will increase the EGT if the VIGV remains open as was found in Section 18.2.2. In this case, the VIGV control system will open, the VIGV to maintain the EGT at its set point. The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, thus compensating for the reduced flow capacity of the compressor due to fouling. Hence, the operating point on the compressor characteristic remains essentially unchanged as shown in Fig. 18.22.

Furthermore, the opening of the VIGV improves the compressor efficiency due to the operating point matching on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is higher. The compensates for the loss in compressor efficiency due to fouling and is discussed in Section 16.3.3.
