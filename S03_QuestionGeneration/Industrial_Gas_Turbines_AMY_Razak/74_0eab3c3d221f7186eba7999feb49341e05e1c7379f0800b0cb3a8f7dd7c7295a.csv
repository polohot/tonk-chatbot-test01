The amount of expansion in the stator and rotor is controlled by the design of the turbine and is called the reaction of the stage.

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

|ΔVW|α1|β2| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|β1|Ca|V₁|C₁|V₂|C₂|Ca|α2|

# Axial turbines

ΔH/U2 and Ca/U are called the stage loading and flow coefficients, respectively. It is worth noting that the stage loading coefficient is also given by ΔVw/U.

Smith4 generated a correlation relating turbine efficiency with the stage loading and flow coefficients and this is often referred to as the Smith plot. This is shown in Fig. ",What determines the reaction of a turbine stage according to the text?,"The reaction of a turbine stage is determined by the design of the turbine, specifically how much expansion takes place in the stator and rotor.","It's controlled by the turbine's design, with 100% reaction when all expansion occurs in the rotor and 0% (impulse stage) when all expansion is in the stator.","The reaction is defined by the distribution of expansion between the stator and rotor, as per the turbine's design.","According to the text, the reaction percentage depends on where the gas expansion happens: entirely in the rotor for 100%, or entirely in the stator for 0%.","The turbine stage's reaction is a measure of expansion distribution, fully in the rotor for complete reaction and fully in the stator for no reaction."

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

This is shown in Fig. ",Why is there no question of turbines surging as mentioned in the text?,"Turbines operate under a favourable pressure gradient, decreasing pressure through stages, eliminating surge concerns.","The favourable pressure gradient in turbines, where pressure decreases through stages, prevents surging.","Due to the decreasing pressure through turbine stages, known as a favourable pressure gradient, surging is not an issue.","Surging isn't a concern in turbines because they work with a pressure that decreases through the stages, a condition referred to as favourable pressure gradient.","The text states turbines don't surge thanks to their operation under a favourable pressure gradient, with pressure decreasing through stages."

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

|ΔVW|α1|β2| | | | | |

This is shown in Fig. ",How does the pressure gradient in turbines compare to that in compressors?,"Turbines have a favourable pressure gradient with decreasing pressure, unlike compressors, leading to less boundary layer growth.","The pressure decreases in turbines, creating a favourable gradient, which contrasts with compressors and reduces boundary layer issues.","Unlike compressors, turbines operate under a decreasing pressure gradient, minimizing boundary layer growth.","Turbines experience a favourable pressure gradient (pressure decreases), differing from compressors and resulting in smaller boundary layer growth.","The text notes turbines' favourable pressure gradient, with pressure decreasing through stages, unlike compressors, affecting boundary layer growth."

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.
