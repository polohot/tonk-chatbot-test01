To achieve this, the flow area is increased progressively along the turbine. By enlarging the flow area, the cross-sectional space available for the fluid to pass through becomes larger, which compensates for the decreasing density of the fluid. As a result, even though the density is lower, the axial velocity can be kept constant by ensuring that the mass flow rate remains consistent.

1. **Constant Flow Area**: The design of axial turbines allows for an increase in flow area along the turbine to accommodate the decreasing density of the working fluid. By maintaining a constant axial velocity, the turbine can ensure that the flow remains efficient and stable throughout its operation.

2. **Velocity Triangles**: The inlet and exit velocity triangles are superimposed on a common base, \( U \), which corresponds to the axial velocity. This relationship helps in visualizing and analyzing the flow characteristics and performance of the turbine, allowing engineers to optimize the design for better efficiency.

3. **Stage Loading and Flow Coefficients**: The axial velocity is integral to defining the stage loading coefficient (\( \Delta H/U^2 \)) and the flow coefficient (\( Ca/U \)). These coefficients are essential for assessing the performance of the turbine and are used in correlations, such as the Smith plot, which relates turbine efficiency to these parameters.
