# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

# 5.10 Turbine efficiency characteristic.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

|Exhaust gases|LP|
|---|---|
|economiser|LP|
|boiler|LP drum|
|HP|economiser|
|HP drum|HP|
|boiler|HP superheater|
|LP superheater|LP steam|
|HP steam|Condenser|
|Gas turbine|Generator|
|HP steam turbine|LP steam|
|Steam for turbine cooling| |

5.15 Gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for the turbine cooling system.

# 134 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

",How is the stage pressure ratio (Rs) calculated in the context of industrial gas turbines?,"The stage pressure ratio (Rs) is calculated using the formula: Rs = 1/[1 – ΔT/(T × ηₛ)]^(γ/(γ–1)), where ΔT is the stage temperature change, T is the stage inlet temperature, ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency, and γ is the ratio of specific heats.","Rs is determined by the stage temperature change (ΔT), inlet temperature (T), isentropic efficiency (ηₛ), and the ratio of specific heats (γ), following the equation Rs = 1/[1 – ΔT/(T × ηₛ)]^(γ/(γ–1)).","To find Rs, use ΔT (from ΔH/cₚ), T, ηₛ, and γ in the expression Rs = 1/[1 – ΔT/(T × ηₛ)]^(γ/(γ–1)), as detailed in 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'.","In 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance', Rs is given by 1/[1 – ΔT/(T × ηₛ)]^(γ/(γ–1)), incorporating stage temperature change, inlet temperature, efficiency, and specific heats ratio.","The calculation involves ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, then applying Rs = 1/[1 – ΔT/(T × ηₛ)]^(γ/(γ–1)), where all variables are defined in the text."

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

|Exhaust gases|LP|
|---|---|

5.15 Gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for the turbine cooling system.

# 134 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

# 5.10 Turbine efficiency characteristic.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

Pressure ratio

# 5.10 Turbine efficiency characteristic.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

|Exhaust gases|LP|
|---|---|

|boiler|LP drum|
|HP|economiser|

5.15 Gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for the turbine cooling system.

# 134 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

# 5.10 Turbine efficiency characteristic.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

|Exhaust gases|LP|
|---|---|
|economiser|LP|
|boiler|LP drum|
|HP|economiser|
|HP drum|HP|
|boiler|HP superheater|
|LP superheater|LP steam|
|HP steam|Condenser|

|Steam for turbine cooling| |

5.15 Gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for the turbine cooling system.

# 134 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature.

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life.

The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

|Exhaust gases|LP|
|---|---|
|economiser|LP|
|boiler|LP drum|
|HP|economiser|
|HP drum|HP|
|boiler|HP superheater|
|LP superheater|LP steam|

|Steam for turbine cooling| |

5.15 Gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for the turbine cooling system.

# 134 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

",How does steam cooling compare to air cooling in turbine blade applications according to the text?,"Steam cooling, unlike air cooling, doesn't mix with the gas stream, reducing temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane and potentially increasing stator outlet temperature.","Steam cooling avoids the temperature reduction seen with air cooling by not reintroducing cooling medium into the gas stream, enhancing performance.","It offers advantages in combined cycle plants by utilizing steam from the cycle, with heat removal contributing to power production, unlike air cooling.","Steam cooling can increase SOT relative to air cooling, requiring lower firing temperatures for the same NOx levels, as it doesn't dilute the gas stream.","The text suggests steam cooling is more efficient in certain contexts, especially in combined cycles, by leveraging steam's properties and avoiding the drawbacks of air cooling."

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

# 5.10 Turbine efficiency characteristic.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

Pressure ratio

# 5.10 Turbine efficiency characteristic.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

# Axial turbines

of non-dimensional flow with turbine speed but this is usually small, particularly in the normal operating speed range (90% and above) of the turbine. The turbine characteristic for a choked rotor is shown in Fig. 5.9.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

As discussed previously, the importance of high turbine entry temperature on engine performance has been established. As a result, modern gas turbines operate at very high temperatures where creep is a serious problem. Special nickel-based alloys have been developed to resist creep. Currently, industrial gas turbines can operate continuously at blade metal temperatures at about 1000 K. Nonetheless, creep is a major factor that limits the allowable turbine entry temperature.

One parameter that has found widespread use in assessing creep life is the Larson–Miller (LM) parameter. This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

# 5.7 Turbine blade cooling

Gas turbine performance is dependent on the gas temperature at entry to the turbine. In the absence of turbine blade cooling, the gas temperature and the turbine blade temperature will be the same. Significant increases in gas temperature can be achieved by cooling the turbine blade so as to maintain the blade metal temperature at an acceptable value, thus achieving the required creep life. The benefit in increased engine performance due to the higher gas temperature is still substantial, even after accounting for any additional losses in the turbine due to the effects of employing cooling techniques.

Turbine blade cooling can use either liquid or air as the cooling medium. Liquid cooling systems using water have been tried but have proved to be unreliable; currently, air as a cooling medium is used almost exclusively. However, steam, and mist (wet steam) cooling have been investigated and are currently applied to gas turbines used in combined cycle plants.

Air is normally bled from the compressor discharge and channelled into the turbine nozzle and rotor internal passages. The bleeding of air for cooling purposes has an impact on engine performance, and the cooling air is normally re-introduced into the gas stream after carrying out the cooling function, to minimise the loss due to these bleeds.

The four following techniques are used for turbine (air) cooling, based on convection, impingement, film and transpiration cooling processes.

# Axial turbines

# 5.7.1 Convection cooling

Convection cooling involves the cooling air being directed to flow inside the nozzles and rotor blades, thereby removing heat from the blade material. The flow is usually radial, making multiple passes through the nozzle or rotor blade. The cooling air normally re-enters the gas stream at the blade tip and trailing edge. Figure 5.12 shows a schematic of convection cooling.

# 5.7.2 Impingement cooling

Impingement cooling is similar to convection cooling but with a much higher intensity. The cooling air is forced to impinge on the blade internal surfaces, usually at the leading edge of the blade. The increased level of turbulence that is generated increases the heat transfer and is used to cool the leading edge of the blade where the maximum blade temperature usually occurs (stagnation point). The cooling air may also enter the gas stream at the trailing edge of the blade. An example of impingement cooling of the blade leading edge is shown in Fig. 5.13.

5.12 Schematic of a convection-cooled blade.

5.13 Impingement cooling.

# 5.7.3 Film cooling

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

# 5.7.4 Transpiration cooling

The method of cooling in transpiration cooling is similar to that of film cooling, but the cooling air leaves the internals of the blade through a porous section of the blade wall. The cooling air can cover the whole blade and therefore is very effective for very high temperature applications. However, it has a negative effect on stage efficiency.

# 5.7.5 Steam and mist cooling

As stated earlier, steam and mist cooling is a new development in turbine cooling and uses steam as the cooling medium. As explained in Chapter 2, there are advantages in employing steam cooling, particularly in reducing the temperature drop across the nozzle guide vane. As a result, steam cooling increases the stator outlet temperature (SOT) relative to an air-cooled turbine where the cooling air returns to the gas stream and reduces the gas temperature due to mixing. Therefore, air-cooled turbines require increased firing temperatures (TET) to maintain the required SOT, thus increasing NOx emissions. However, a large amount of steam is needed and current developments are looking at the application of mist cooling where water vapour is injected into the steam for blade cooling. The high latent heat of water helps reduce the steam cooling requirements. Some issues of steam and mist cooling are discussed in Wang et al.6

# Axial turbines

The scheme for steam cooling is similar to convection cooling as shown in Fig. 5.12; however, the steam does not enter the gas stream but returns to the external cooling system. In a combined cycle plant the turbine cooling steam is provided from the steam cycle, and the heat removed from the turbine blades is returned to the steam cycle, where it is utilised in power production, thus improving the performance of the combined cycle.7

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

|Exhaust gases|LP|
|---|---|

5.15 Gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for the turbine cooling system.

# 134 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

# 5.4 Stage pressure ratio

The temperature change in the stage is determined by the stage stagnation enthalpy change ΔH. Assuming the products of combustion act as a perfect gas, the stage temperature change is given by ΔT = ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the

# 126 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

specific heat of the gas at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio, Rs, can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = 1 γ

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- and T is the stage inlet temperature (total or stagnation).

# 5.4.1 Worked example

The turbine (Fig. 5.1) consists of two stages whose stage-loading coefficients are identical and the turbine uses a constant mean diameter design.

# First stage

- Stage-loading coefficient = 2.5
- Blade velocity, U = 250 m/s
- Stage inlet temperature, T₁ = 1400 K
- Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9
- cₚ = 1.147 kJ/kg K
- γ = 1.333
- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K

From Equation 5.11:

Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1400 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.58036

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1400 – 136.22 = 1263.78 K

# Second stage

- ΔH = 2.5(250)²/1000 = 156.25 kJ/kg
- ΔT = ΔH/cₚ = 156.25/1.147 = 136.22 K
- Rs = 1/[1 – 136.22/(1263.78 × 0.9)]1.333/(1.333–1) = 1.6657
- T₂ = T₁ – ΔT = 1263.78 – 136.22 = 1127.56 K

# Axial turbines

The overall pressure ratio will be the product of the two stage pressure ratios. Hence the turbine overall pressure ratio Prₒ = 1.58036 × 1.6657 = 2.5045.

If the two-stage turbine were to drive the compressor, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.5), there would be a shortage on power. The enthalpy rise per compressor stage is 31.25 kJ/kg. For 16 stages, the total enthalpy per unit mass flow rate would be 500 kJ/kg. The turbine produces only an enthalpy drop of 156.25 × 2 = 312.5 kJ/kg. If the blade velocity, U, is increased from 250 m/s to 325 m/s and the same enthalpy rise in the compressor is maintained, then the turbine will produce an enthalpy drop of 528.125 kJ/kg, which is in excess of that needed by the compressor.

A turbine entry temperature of 1400 K will require cooled turbine blades and the efficiency will be reduced to about 90%. A constant enthalpy rise has been maintained across the compressor stage and the speed has been increased. This will result in a reduced stage-loading coefficient and will benefit the compressor by improving the efficiency of the compressor.

It may be concluded that a two-stage turbine could drive the compressor discussed above, thus illustrating that the higher stage-loading coefficients present in turbines require fewer turbine stages to drive many stages of compressors.

# 5.5 Overall turbine characteristics

As with compressors, it is convenient to represent turbine performance in terms of non-dimensional parameters such as flows and speeds, which are based on all the stages in the turbine. This is very useful when we wish to carry out off-design performance calculations of the gas turbine. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, where the inlet.

Non-dimensional flow and turbine isentropic efficiency are plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. The non-dimensional mass flow and speeds are relative to the design. The non-dimensional mass flow increases with pressure ratio and beyond a certain pressure ratio the Mach number inside the aerofoil reaches unity and this restricts the amount of non-dimensional flow that can pass through the turbine. Under these operating conditions the turbine is said to be choked. The non-dimensional mass flow remains constant due to choking only if the stator (NGV) is choked, as shown in Fig. 5.8. If the rotor is choked, there is some variation.

A typical turbine efficiency characteristic is shown in Fig. 5.10. There is some decrease in the efficiency with pressure ratio at lower speeds but in the normal operating speed range, at 80% and higher the efficiency is essentially constant.

# 5.6 Turbine creep life

Metals operating above a certain temperature under tensile stress will elongate with time. This phenomenon is commonly known as creep and is measured by the rate of strain per hour for a given stress and temperature. The higher the stress and temperature, the greater is the amount of creep strain. Creep deformation will eventually result in fracture of the turbine blade material.

This parameter combines temperature and creep life data and is a useful analytical technique for evaluating the effects of stress on creep life over a range of temperatures. The parameter, LM, is quoted as:

LM = 1.8T(20 + ln( t)) [5.12]

where T is the metal temperature in K and t is the creep life in hours.

Figure 5.11 shows a typical Larson–Miller curve relating stress to the LM parameter.

If, for a given stress level, a creep life of say 25 000 hours is required at a blade temperature of 900 K, from Equation 5.12 a Larson–Miller parameter is obtained of 48 805. If the same blade now operates at a slightly lower temperature of 880 K but at a constant stress level, the creep life will be increased to 49 575 hours. The creep life has nearly doubled for a 20 K reduction in blade temperature at a constant stress level. A similar effect on creep life is also found with a change in tensile stress. However, the change in creep life is not as dramatic as is found with a change in blade temperature. Further details of turbine creep life and turbine materials may be found in Boyce.⁵

Film cooling is achieved by allowing the cooling air to flow over the blade exterior, thus forming an insulating layer to protect the blade material from the hot gases. The cooling air leaves the blade internals through cooling slots on the blade surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

A schematic representation of a gas turbine combined cycle plant employing steam for turbine cooling is shown in Fig. 5.15. Steam for turbine cooling is taken at the exit of the high pressure (HP) steam turbine and returned to the inlet of the low pressure (LP) steam turbine after cooling the gas turbine blades.

# 5.8 Turbine metal temperature assessment

The previous section discussed the blade cooling technology that can be employed to lower the turbine blade metal temperature below that of the gas stream. For air-cooled turbines, the turbine metal temperature can be calculated by using the cooling effectiveness parameter which is defined by:

ε = Tᵍ – Tᵐ [5.13]

where

- ε is the cooling effectiveness parameter
- Tg is the gas temperature
- Tₘ is the turbine blade metal temperature
- Tc is the cooling air temperature.

The value of ε will vary depending on the cooling technology employed and, this value could be about 0.65 for film cooling, or higher for advanced cooling concepts.

The cooling air for the high-pressure turbine stages will be bled off at the compressor discharge and the cooling air temperature will be about 630 K. For a turbine entry temperature of 1400 K and a cooling effectiveness parameter of 0.65, the turbine metal temperature will then be about 900 K. From our analysis of turbine life using the Larson–Miller parameter above, these conditions will give a creep life of about 25 000 hours. The importance of the cooling air temperature on the metal temperature, hence on creep life, must be emphasised. A reduction in compressor efficiency will increase the compressor discharge temperature and therefore the cooling air temperature.

If the cooling air temperature is raised by 20 K, due to poor compressor efficiency, the metal temperature will increase to 912.5 K. We have seen that a 20 K increase in metal temperature can reduce the creep life by about half. In this instance the creep life will reduce to about 16 500 hours, representing a significant loss in creep and therefore blade life. Thus, reducing the cooling air temperature by external cooling or employing intercooled cycles as discussed in Chapter 3 will be beneficial in significantly increasing the turbine creep life.

# 5.9 Effect of cooling technology on thermal efficiency

The cooling air requirements for two different cooling technologies are illustrated in Fig. 5.16 for a metal temperature of about 1000 K. The cooling air mass flow requirement for convection cooling is always higher than for film cooling. In fact, the cooling air requirement for convection cooling increases exponentially with increase in turbine entry temperature, and as the turbine entry temperature increases, the cooling air requirement becomes prohibitively high. This is also illustrated in Fig. 5.17, which shows the impact of these cooling technologies on the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Figure 5.17 shows the thermal efficiency actually decreasing with convection cooling at turbine temperatures above 1250 K.

# Impact of different cooling technologies on gas turbine thermal efficiency.

Although convection cooling is not as efficient compared with film cooling, it is more reliable as dirt and dust do not impact upon the cooling performance compared with film cooling, where the cooling holes are rather small and can easily become clogged. In practice, both these technologies are used in an attempt to obtain the best compromise.

",Compare the cooling air mass flow requirements for convection and film cooling technologies at high turbine entry temperatures.,"Convection cooling requires significantly more air than film cooling at high temperatures, with its demand increasing exponentially, making it less efficient.","At elevated temperatures, convection cooling's air needs surge exponentially, unlike film cooling, which maintains lower, more manageable requirements.","The text shows convection cooling's air flow escalates rapidly with temperature, becoming impractical, whereas film cooling remains more efficient.","For high turbine entry temperatures, convection cooling's air mass flow becomes prohibitively high compared to the more economical film cooling.","Convection cooling's air demand grows exponentially with temperature, as depicted in the text, highlighting film cooling's advantage in high-temperature applications."
