1. **Fixed Operating Points**: When the gas generator turbine efficiency is constant, the operating points (2) and (3) on the gas generator turbine characteristic will coincide. This means that the relationship between the gas generator turbine and the power turbine remains stable, allowing for predictable performance under varying conditions.

2. **Flow Compatibility**: The flow compatibility between the gas generator turbine and the power turbine is primarily determined by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine. If the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant, the pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature drop (ΔT₃₄/T₃) will also remain constant during power turbine choked conditions. This ensures that the turbines can operate efficiently in series without significant deviations in performance.

3. **Minimal Efficiency Variation**: The assumption of constant efficiency implies that any changes in operating conditions (such as pressure ratio or non-dimensional speed) will not lead to significant variations in the efficiency of the gas generator turbine. This simplifies the analysis and design of turbine systems, as engineers can rely on stable performance metrics.

4. **Predictable Performance**: With constant efficiency, the performance of the gas generator turbine can be more easily predicted across different operating scenarios. This predictability is crucial for system design, control strategies, and operational planning.

When the gas generator turbine operates at a specific pressure ratio, it dictates the non-dimensional flow and temperature ratios, which are crucial for maintaining optimal performance.

As indicated in the context, during off-design operation, the gas generator turbine's efficiency is assumed to remain constant across different operating cases. However, if there is a change in efficiency due to varying pressure ratios, the operating points on the characteristic curve may not align as expected. This can lead to variations in performance, particularly in terms of the temperature drop across the turbine and the overall efficiency of the system.

Moreover, the flow compatibility equation highlights that the gas generator turbine's pressure ratio is linked to the non-dimensional flow at its inlet and the temperature ratio across the turbine. Therefore, maintaining an appropriate pressure ratio is essential for ensuring that the gas generator turbine operates efficiently and effectively in conjunction with the power turbine, especially under choked conditions where the performance is more sensitive to changes in pressure and flow characteristics."

1. **Flow Compatibility Equation**: The equation for turbines operating in series indicates that the non-dimensional flow at the inlet of the gas generator turbine (W₃√T₃/P₃) and the power turbine inlet (W₄√T₄/P₄) are related to the pressure ratio (P₃/P₄) and the temperature ratio (T₃/T₄). Specifically, during power turbine choked conditions, if the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant, the non-dimensional temperature drop (ΔT₃₄/T₃) will also remain constant. This implies that the non-dimensional flow is influenced by the temperature ratios, as the flow rates and pressure ratios are interconnected with the temperature ratios.

2. **Power Balance Equation**: The power balance or work compatibility equation for the gas generator turbine relates the temperature rise (ΔT₂₁) to the temperature drop (ΔT₃₄) and the gas flow (W₃). This indicates that for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, the non-dimensional temperature rise (ΔT₂₁/T₁) remains approximately constant, which further emphasizes the relationship between non-dimensional flow and temperature ratios.

In summary, the non-dimensional flow at various points in the gas turbine system is directly related to the temperature ratios, with specific equations governing their interactions under different operating conditions."

Under choked conditions, the power turbine operates at specific points on its characteristic curve (points (2) and (3) in the provided context), and the gas generator turbine is forced to operate at a fixed pressure ratio. This means that the flow is limited by the speed of sound in the gas, and any further increase in pressure or flow rate cannot occur without a change in the operating conditions."

In the context of turbines operating in series, the temperature ratio is linked to the pressure ratio across the gas generator turbine and affects the non-dimensional flow characteristics.

When the power turbine is choked, the gas generator turbine's pressure ratio remains constant, which implies that the temperature drop \( \Delta T_{34}/T_3 \) will also be constant, provided that the efficiency of the gas generator turbine remains stable. This relationship indicates that the performance of the power turbine is influenced by the thermal conditions established by the gas generator turbine. 

In essence, a consistent temperature ratio \( T_3/T_4 \) allows for predictable performance characteristics of the power turbine, as it ensures that the flow compatibility between the gas generator and power turbine is maintained. Any variations in this ratio can lead to changes in the operating points and efficiency of both turbines, ultimately impacting the overall performance of the gas turbine system."

It compresses the air, raising its temperature and pressure, which is essential for efficient combustion of the fuel. This process enhances the energy content of the air-fuel mixture, allowing for a more powerful and efficient combustion process in the combustor. The high-pressure, high-temperature air then enters the gas generator turbine, where it expands and produces work, ultimately driving the power turbine. Thus, the compressor is vital for ensuring the effective performance and efficiency of the gas turbine system."
