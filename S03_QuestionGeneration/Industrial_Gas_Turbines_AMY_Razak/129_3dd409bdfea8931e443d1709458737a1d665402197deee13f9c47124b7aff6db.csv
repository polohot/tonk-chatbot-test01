# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

W₄P T₄ = W₃P T₃ × P³ × T₄ × W₄ [8.3]

where

- W₃√T₃/P₃ is the non-dimensional flow at entry to the gas generator turbine
- P₃/P₄ is the gas generator turbine pressure ratio
- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

During power turbine choked conditions, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio and thus the non-dimensional temperature drop, ΔT₃₄/T₃, will be constant provided the generator turbine efficiency is also constant.

For a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁ will be approximately constant (see Fig. 8.3). ",Why is the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise approximately constant for a given non-dimensional speed?,"Because the compressor's performance characteristics are such that for a specific non-dimensional speed, the temperature rise remains nearly constant.","The compressor's design and operational dynamics ensure that at a set non-dimensional speed, the temperature rise doesn't vary much.","For a fixed non-dimensional speed, the compressor's efficiency and flow conditions stabilize the temperature rise.",The inherent properties of the compressor make the temperature rise steady at a given non-dimensional speed.,"Due to the compressor's performance curve, the temperature rise is largely invariant at a particular non-dimensional speed."

When the power turbine operates unchoked, point (1) in Fig. 8.5, the gas generator turbine will be forced to operate at point (1) on its characteristic to satisfy the flow compatibility between these turbines. When the power turbine operates under choked conditions, points (2) and (3) on the power turbine characteristic, the gas generator turbine will be forced to operate at a fixed pressure ratio as shown by point (2, 3) on the gas generator characteristic.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

W₄P T₄ = W₃P T₃ × P³ × T₄ × W₄ [8.3]

where

- W₃√T₃/P₃ is the non-dimensional flow at entry to the gas generator turbine
- P₃/P₄ is the gas generator turbine pressure ratio
- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

During power turbine choked conditions, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio and thus the non-dimensional temperature drop, ΔT₃₄/T₃, will be constant provided the generator turbine efficiency is also constant.
