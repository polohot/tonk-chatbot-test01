# Trends in power and thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage.

operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow can increase to satisfy the generator power demand, thereby resulting in increases in pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds, as seen in previous figures.

Notice that the gas power has indeed increased due to the power turbine damage. Since the power turbine fault resulted only in a loss in power turbine efficiency, the gas generator performance is unaffected by this degradation. The loss in power turbine efficiency thus results in an increase.

in gas power to maintain the same gas turbine power output, hence the increase in the gas power output (as seen in Fig. 13.45 where the generator power output remains on the set point). This increase in gas power output improves the gas thermal efficiency due to the increase in compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio. The increase in gas power demands an increase in fuel flow; however the gas turbine power output remains the same. Hence the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases due to the power turbine damage.

# Trends in turbine creep life usage

The trends in creep life usage for the gas generator turbine and power turbine due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.46. An increase in creep life usage is observed for both these turbines. Power turbine damage results in an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature. The increase in stress due to the increase in speed, and the higher turbine blade temperature due to the increase in turbine entry temperature, result in an increase in the gas generator turbine creep life usage. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature also results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature, thus increasing the power turbine creep life usage.

Trends in gas turbine emissions due to power turbine damage. Power turbine damage results in an increase in NOₓ, while the effect on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow and loss in thermal efficiency, due to power turbine damage, results in an increase in CO emissions on a mass and index basis.

# Displacement of the running line

Since the power turbine efficiency loss due to rotor blade tip rubs does not affect the performance of the gas generator, there is no shift in the running lines. The reader is left to plot the running lines and compare them with the case when no faults are present to demonstrate that there is no displacement in the running line. However, if the power turbine suffered from hot end damage, thus changing the non-dimensional flow of the power turbine, there would be a displacement in the running line. Again, the reader is left to run this simulation to demonstrate the effect of power turbine hot end damage on the running lines. Setting the power turbine fouling fault index and efficiency fault index to 3% and –2%, respectively can simulate hot end damage of the power turbine over a suitable ramp rate.

Trends in gas turbine emissions due to power turbine damage. Power turbine damage results in an increase in NOₓ, while the effect on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow and loss in thermal efficiency, due to power turbine damage, results in an increase in CO emissions on a mass and index basis.

# Displacement of the running line

Since the power turbine efficiency loss due to rotor blade tip rubs does not affect the performance of the gas generator, there is no shift in the running lines. The reader is left to plot the running lines and compare them with the case when no faults are present to demonstrate that there is no displacement in the running line. However, if the power turbine suffered from hot end damage, thus changing the non-dimensional flow of the power turbine, there would be a displacement in the running line. Again, the reader is left to run this simulation to demonstrate the effect of power turbine hot end damage on the running lines. Setting the power turbine fouling fault index and efficiency fault index to 3% and –2%, respectively can simulate hot end damage of the power turbine over a suitable ramp rate.

operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow can increase to satisfy the generator power demand, thereby resulting in increases in pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds, as seen in previous figures.

Notice that the gas power has indeed increased due to the power turbine damage. Since the power turbine fault resulted only in a loss in power turbine efficiency, the gas generator performance is unaffected by this degradation. The loss in power turbine efficiency thus results in an increase.

This increase in gas power output improves the gas thermal efficiency due to the increase in compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio. The increase in gas power demands an increase in fuel flow; however the gas turbine power output remains the same. Hence the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases due to the power turbine damage.

The trends in creep life usage for the gas generator turbine and power turbine due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.46. An increase in creep life usage is observed for both these turbines. Power turbine damage results in an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature. The increase in stress due to the increase in speed, and the higher turbine blade temperature due to the increase in turbine entry temperature, result in an increase in the gas generator turbine creep life usage. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature also results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature, thus increasing the power turbine creep life usage.

# Trends in power and thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage.

operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow can increase to satisfy the generator power demand, thereby resulting in increases in pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds, as seen in previous figures.

Notice that the gas power has indeed increased due to the power turbine damage. Since the power turbine fault resulted only in a loss in power turbine efficiency, the gas generator performance is unaffected by this degradation. The loss in power turbine efficiency thus results in an increase.

in gas power to maintain the same gas turbine power output, hence the increase in the gas power output (as seen in Fig. 13.45 where the generator power output remains on the set point). This increase in gas power output improves the gas thermal efficiency due to the increase in compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio. The increase in gas power demands an increase in fuel flow; however the gas turbine power output remains the same. Hence the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases due to the power turbine damage.

# Trends in turbine creep life usage

The trends in creep life usage for the gas generator turbine and power turbine due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.46. An increase in creep life usage is observed for both these turbines. Power turbine damage results in an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature. The increase in stress due to the increase in speed, and the higher turbine blade temperature due to the increase in turbine entry temperature, result in an increase in the gas generator turbine creep life usage. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature also results in an increase in the power turbine blade temperature, thus increasing the power turbine creep life usage.

Trends in gas turbine emissions due to power turbine damage. Power turbine damage results in an increase in NOₓ, while the effect on CO is small. The increase in fuel flow and loss in thermal efficiency, due to power turbine damage, results in an increase in CO emissions on a mass and index basis.

# Displacement of the running line

Since the power turbine efficiency loss due to rotor blade tip rubs does not affect the performance of the gas generator, there is no shift in the running lines. The reader is left to plot the running lines and compare them with the case when no faults are present to demonstrate that there is no displacement in the running line. However, if the power turbine suffered from hot end damage, thus changing the non-dimensional flow of the power turbine, there would be a displacement in the running line. Again, the reader is left to run this simulation to demonstrate the effect of power turbine hot end damage on the running lines. Setting the power turbine fouling fault index and efficiency fault index to 3% and –2%, respectively can simulate hot end damage of the power turbine over a suitable ramp rate.
