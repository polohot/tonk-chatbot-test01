The summation of these two sources of lost revenue will give the total lost revenue curve. The optimised wash frequency occurs when the total lost revenue is a minimum, as shown in Figs 9.19 and 9.20 for a high and low power case, respectively. Factors that influence wash frequency include the following:

- price of product (e.g. electricity unit price)
- production
- fuel cost
- emissions CO₂ taxes if applicable
- downtime and cost of wash (including the cost of disposal of wash material such as detergents).

Increase in unit price, fuel cost and emissions taxes will tend to increase the wash frequency, while increase in downtime and costs associated with the compressor wash activity will tend to reduce the wash frequency. The power demand will also influence the wash frequency. A higher power demand, where the engine has to operate near or at the engine operating limit such as the EGT, will tend to increase the wash frequency.

The method described above can be adapted to cover online wash systems. This is achieved by generating the compressor fouling profile due to online washing. It should be noted that online washing is not as effective as offline washes and the fouling fault index profile will look similar to that shown in Fig. 9.16, where there would be a small offset in the fault indices after each online wash. This offset would get progressively larger after each wash, due to residual fouling. However, there is no downtime penalty for washing and

# Gas turbine performance deterioration

The engine availability is high. Thus, online wash frequencies would tend to be high. When the engine performance loss due to residual fouling is greater than the performance improvement due to an offline wash, then this will be an indication as to when an offline wash will be beneficial as discussed by Razak and Carlyle.14 The benefits of online washing have yet to be clearly demonstrated and, as stated above, there have been reports of impact damage and erosion to compressor blades resulting from online washes. These effects would therefore have an effect on online wash frequency.
