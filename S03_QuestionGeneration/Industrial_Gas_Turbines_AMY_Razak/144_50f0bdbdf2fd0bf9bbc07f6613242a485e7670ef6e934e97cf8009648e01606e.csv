At low speeds, such as during engine idle conditions, there is little importance placed on compressor flow characteristics. However, during high-speed operation, the efficiency of the compressor is critical, as any loss of efficiency due to fouling can shift the running line towards surge, reducing the surge margin. This shift can adversely affect the performance and reliability of the gas turbine. Therefore, understanding and optimizing the high-speed compressor characteristics is essential for maintaining efficient operation and preventing performance deterioration."

This shift reduces the surge margin, making the compressor more susceptible to surge conditions. As fouling occurs, the change or reduction in flow capacity is typically greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, leading to a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio for a given non-dimensional speed. Consequently, the overall performance of the gas turbine deteriorates, necessitating measures such as compressor washing to recover efficiency and maintain operational stability."

Specifically, when compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, which shifts the running line towards surge and reduces the surge margin. This means that for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio decreases due to fouling effects.

Furthermore, while measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with non-dimensional speed can indicate compressor fouling, it is important to note that other performance-related faults, such as changes in turbine areas, can also influence this relationship. Therefore, a more accurate indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, as this remains unaffected by other performance-related issues."

1. **Surge Margin Improvement**: The closure of the VIGV can lead to a decrease in non-dimensional flow, which can improve the surge margin. A better surge margin means that the compressor is less likely to experience surge, a condition that can lead to catastrophic failure.

2. **Operational Range**: The VIGV and VSV angles are typically functions of the compressor's non-dimensional speed. If the angles are not set correctly, the compressor may operate outside its safe operational range, increasing the risk of surge or stall conditions.

3. **Fault Detection**: Any deviation from the expected operating line during steady-state operation can indicate a fault in the VIGV/VSV system. Early detection of such faults is crucial for maintaining safe operation and preventing damage to the compressor.

4. **Flow Regulation**: Insufficient closure of the VIGV/VSV can lead to increased flow, which may push the compressor towards its operational limits, while excessive closure can reduce flow excessively, leading to potential stall conditions. Both scenarios can compromise the safety and reliability of the gas turbine.

5. **Compressor Performance**: The VIGV/VSV angles directly affect the compressor's performance characteristics. If the angles are not optimized, the compressor may behave as if it is fouled, leading to inefficient operation and increased risk of operational issues.

In summary, careful management of VIGV and VSV angles is essential for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of gas turbine compressors, as improper settings can lead to surge, stall, and other potentially hazardous conditions."
