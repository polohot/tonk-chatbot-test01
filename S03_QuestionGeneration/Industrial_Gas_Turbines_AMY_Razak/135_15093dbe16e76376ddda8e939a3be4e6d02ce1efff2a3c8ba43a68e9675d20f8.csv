This constancy is crucial for maintaining flow compatibility between the high-pressure (HP) compressor and turbine during off-design operation. As the engine load changes, the HP compressor pressure ratio must also remain essentially constant to ensure this compatibility, allowing all pressure ratio changes to occur in the low-pressure (LP) compressor instead."

1. **Constant Flow Relationships**: The relationships W₃√T₃/P₃ and W₅√T₅/P₅ are assumed to be constant, which indicates that the vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle conditions are maintained.

2. **Pressure Losses and Bleeds**: It is assumed that pressure losses are constant and that any bleed air is ignored.

3. **Pressure Ratio Maintenance**: The HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine.

4. **Pressure Ratio Changes**: For a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio changes occur in the low-pressure (LP) compressor, rather than in the HP compressor, which contrasts with scenarios where variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) are not used.

5. **Constant Maximum Cycle Temperature**: The maximum cycle temperature (T₅) is maintained constant, which influences the operating conditions of the HP compressor and turbine.

6. **Fixed Operating Point**: The operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged at part load conditions, with all pressure ratio changes occurring in the LP compressor.

7. **Choked LP Turbine**: The LP turbine remains choked, which forces the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed, thus maintaining a constant non-dimensional temperature drop across the HP turbine.

8. **Intercooling Effects**: The intercooling process is assumed to take place between the LP and HP compressors, which helps maintain a constant HP compressor inlet temperature.

These assumptions are crucial for analyzing the performance and behavior of gas turbines during off-design conditions."

When the power turbine capacity is adjusted to maintain a constant turbine entry temperature at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged. This means that all the pressure ratio changes occur in the low-pressure (LP) compressor instead of the HP compressor.

The variable geometry allows the LP turbine to remain choked, which in turn forces the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Consequently, the non-dimensional temperature drop across the HP turbine also remains constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to the intercooling process, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine keeps the HP compressor's non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. Thus, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic is fixed, where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic. 

Overall, the variable geometry effectively stabilizes the operating point of the HP compressor during off-design conditions, allowing for better performance management in varying load scenarios."

As the operating conditions change, the constraints imposed by the intercooling process and the fixed operating points of the compressors and turbines limit the ability to adjust the pressure ratios effectively, leading to a decrease in thermal efficiency compared to the design point performance."

The performance and operational characteristics of the LP turbine can limit the flow and pressure conditions that the HP turbine can achieve. Specifically, the flow demanded by the power turbine (which is linked to the LP turbine) must be satisfied, and this requirement can constrain the HP turbine's operating point. As a result, the LP turbine effectively governs the operational limits of the HP turbine, ensuring that the overall system remains balanced and operates efficiently within its design parameters."

When the VIGV are opened, the LP compressor operates at a higher flow rate, which can lead to an increase in the compressor pressure ratio. This adjustment allows for better matching of the compressor's operating point with the demands of the system, particularly under varying load conditions. The running line on the LP compressor characteristic will reflect this change, indicating different operating speeds and temperatures at various power outputs.

Conversely, when the VIGV are closed, the flow into the LP compressor is restricted, which can decrease the flow rate and potentially lower the compressor pressure ratio. This change may result in a different operating point on the compressor characteristic, affecting the efficiency and performance of the gas turbine system.

Overall, the opening and closing of the VIGV allow for dynamic adjustments to the compressor's performance, enabling better control of the gas turbine's operation during off-design conditions."

In the context of an intercooled gas turbine, the running line indicates the relationship between the non-dimensional speed and the pressure ratio of the compressors at various power outputs. It shows how the HP compressor's operating point remains largely unaffected by changes in power output when the maximum cycle temperature is held constant. This means that as the engine load changes, the HP compressor operates at a fixed point on its characteristic curve, ensuring flow compatibility with the turbine.

Conversely, the running line for the LP compressor reflects how all pressure ratio changes occur in the LP compressor when the HP compressor's operating point is fixed. This behavior is crucial for maintaining efficient operation under off-design conditions, as it allows for better control of the overall performance of the gas turbine system.

The power turbine characteristic essentially controls the flow demand that the power turbine requires to operate effectively. 

When the power turbine is adjusted to meet specific operational conditions, it influences the performance of the gas generator turbine by dictating the amount of flow that must be produced by the gas generator to satisfy the power turbine's requirements. This interaction ensures that the flow produced by the gas generator aligns with the flow demanded by the power turbine, thereby maintaining operational compatibility between the two components.

As a result, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined by the flow requirements of the power turbine. If the power turbine's capacity changes, it will necessitate adjustments in the gas generator's operating point to ensure that the flow produced meets the new demand, thus affecting the overall performance and efficiency of the gas turbine system."

This means that both compressors should operate at similar pressure ratios to optimize the overall thermal efficiency of the gas turbine system. However, it is important to note that this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions, which may lead to a decrease in the maximum possible thermal efficiency during such conditions."

It is expressed as \( W_2 \sqrt{T_2}/P_2 \), where \( W_2 \) is the mass flow rate, \( T_2 \) is the temperature at the compressor inlet, and \( P_2 \) is the pressure at the compressor inlet.

Under off-design conditions, the operating point of the HP compressor remains largely unaffected by changes in power output, as the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and the turbine must be maintained. This means that for a given maximum cycle temperature \( T_5 \) and a constant HP compressor inlet temperature (due to intercooling), the non-dimensional flow will remain relatively stable. The HP compressor operates at a fixed non-dimensional speed, which intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on its characteristic curve.

Additionally, the pressure ratio across the HP compressor must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes to ensure compatibility with the turbine's operation. Therefore, while the non-dimensional flow is dependent on the operating conditions, it is constrained by the need to maintain flow compatibility and the fixed operating point determined by the system's design and intercooling effects."

When the turbine nozzles are choked, it means that the flow through the nozzles reaches the speed of sound, which effectively limits the mass flow rate that can pass through them. This condition ensures that the pressure ratio across the turbine remains constant, as the flow is constrained by the choked condition.

In the context of the gas turbine system described, when the high-pressure (HP) turbine operates with choked nozzles, it forces the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Consequently, any changes in operating conditions, such as load variations, will not affect the HP turbine's pressure ratio. Instead, the adjustments to maintain overall system performance, such as changes in power output, will occur primarily in the low-pressure (LP) compressor. This behavior ensures that the HP turbine's non-dimensional temperature drop remains constant, as the turbine entry temperature is kept stable.

Thus, choked turbine nozzles play a crucial role in maintaining flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine, especially under varying operational conditions, by stabilizing the pressure ratio and influencing where pressure ratio changes occur within the system."

This constancy is significant because it indicates that the thermal performance of the turbine is stable, which is crucial for maintaining efficiency and performance.

When the turbine entry temperature is kept constant, typically due to the influence of factors like intercooling or variable geometry in the power turbine, the HP turbine's temperature drop remains fixed. This implies that the energy extracted from the high-pressure turbine remains consistent, allowing for predictable performance and effective power generation, regardless of variations in engine load or operating conditions. This stability is essential for ensuring that the HP compressor and turbine can effectively work together, maintaining the necessary flow compatibility and pressure ratios throughout the operational range of the gas turbine."

This leads to a simplification in the analysis of the gas turbine's performance. Specifically, it allows for the establishment of a relationship where the power output and the corresponding pressure ratios can be maintained more consistently across different operating conditions.

In the context provided, this assumption means that the flow compatibility between the high-pressure (HP) compressor and turbine can be preserved, as the operating characteristics of the HP compressor remain largely unaffected by changes in power output. Consequently, the pressure ratio changes primarily occur in the low-pressure (LP) compressor rather than the HP compressor. This behavior is crucial for maintaining efficiency and performance stability, especially when operating at a constant maximum cycle temperature.

Additionally, the assumption of constant pressure losses supports the idea that the HP turbine's non-dimensional temperature drop remains fixed, which is essential for ensuring that the HP compressor inlet temperature is also kept constant due to intercooling. Overall, this assumption simplifies the operational dynamics of gas turbines during off-design conditions, allowing for a more predictable and manageable performance profile."

When the inlet temperature is kept constant, the non-dimensional speed of the HP compressor remains fixed. This is because the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine is maintained, ensuring that the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic is stable. 

As a result, even under off-design conditions, the HP compressor operates at a consistent non-dimensional speed, which intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on its characteristic curve. This stability allows the HP compressor and turbine to operate efficiently together, as the fixed conditions help to maintain the required flow compatibility between them. However, it is important to note that this fixed operating point may not achieve maximum thermal efficiency at off-design conditions, particularly in intercooled cycles, due to the inability to maintain the optimal split in compressor ratios."

The power turbine's operating conditions dictate how the gas generator turbine must perform to ensure flow compatibility between the two turbines.

When the power turbine requires a certain flow, this demand affects the operating point on the GG turbine characteristic. Specifically, the power turbine characteristic controls the pressure ratio and flow conditions at the exit of the gas generator turbine. If the power turbine is choked, the non-dimensional flow at its inlet must be satisfied by the flow exiting the gas generator turbine. 

For instance, when reheat is applied between the gas generator and power turbine, it alters the matching of the turbines and redistributes the turbine pressure ratios to maintain flow compatibility. As reheat increases, it affects the non-dimensional flow at the exit of the gas generator turbine, which in turn influences the GG turbine pressure ratio. Consequently, the operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat increases, thereby demonstrating how the power turbine characteristic directly impacts the performance and operating conditions of the gas generator turbine."

Specifically, as reheat is applied, the reheat temperature ratio (Tr) increases, which leads to an increase in the exit temperature (T5) from the reheater. This increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in the non-dimensional flow (W4√T4/P4) exiting the gas generator (GG) turbine to maintain flow compatibility. Consequently, this reduction in flow results in a decrease in the GG turbine pressure ratio (P3/P4). The overall effect is that the operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat increases, thereby affecting the performance and efficiency of both turbines."

The flow identity at the exit of the GG turbine is described by the equation:

\[ W4PT4 = W3PT3 \times P3 \times T4 \times W4 \]

This equation indicates that the flow exiting the GG turbine (W4) is dependent on the conditions at the inlet (W3, P3, T4) and the pressure and temperature at the exit of the GG turbine.

On the other hand, the flow identity at the exit of the reheat chamber is given by:

\[ W5PT5 = W4PT4 \times P4 \times T5 \times W5 \]

This equation shows that the flow exiting the reheat chamber (W5) is influenced by the flow coming from the GG turbine (W4, PT4) and the conditions in the reheat chamber (P4, T5).

The relationship between these two identities is crucial for maintaining flow compatibility between the GG turbine and the power turbine. Specifically, the flow exiting the reheat chamber (W5) must be ""swallowed"" by the power turbine, meaning that the flow characteristics must be matched to ensure proper operation. If the power turbine is assumed to be choked, the non-dimensional flow at the exit of the reheat chamber (W5√T5/P5) remains constant as reheat is varied, which necessitates adjustments in the flow from the GG turbine (W4√T4/P4) to satisfy the overall flow balance in the system. 

In summary, the flow identity at the exit of the GG turbine directly influences the flow identity at the exit of the reheat chamber, and both must be managed to ensure the efficient operation of the gas turbine system."

This is because Tr is defined as the ratio of the temperature at the exit of the reheater (T5) to the temperature at the exit of the gas generator turbine (T4). Therefore, as Tr increases, it indicates that T5 is increasing relative to T4, leading to a higher temperature ratio T5/T4."

This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater.

Specifically, if the reheater pressure loss, denoted as \( P_4/P_5 \), is assumed to be constant and we ignore any bleed losses, any increase in reheat (which results in a higher reheat temperature ratio \( T_5/T_4 \)) leads to a decrease in the non-dimensional flow \( W_4\sqrt{T_4}/P_4 \). This is because the reheater exit non-dimensional flow \( W_5\sqrt{T_5}/P_5 \) must be 'swallowed' by the power turbine, and if the power turbine is choked, this flow remains constant as reheat varies. Thus, the dynamics of reheat application directly influence the pressure ratios and non-dimensional flows between the GG turbine and the power turbine."

This relationship is governed by the flow identity described in Equation 8.13. Although there may be an increase in the temperature ratio T4/T3 due to the decrease in P3/P4, the dominant effect is the reduction in the GG turbine pressure ratio itself.

This indicates that there is no reheat applied to the gas turbine system. In this state, the operating characteristics of the gas generator (GG) turbine and the power turbine are aligned without the influence of additional thermal energy from reheat. As reheat is introduced and Tr increases above 1, the operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio, affecting the performance and efficiency of the gas turbine system. The zero reheat line serves as a baseline for understanding how the application of reheat alters the dynamics and performance of the gas turbine."

This decrease in flow must occur to maintain flow compatibility in the reheater, as indicated by the flow identity equations. Consequently, the GG turbine pressure ratio (P3/P4) decreases, which is a dominant effect despite an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine.

Overall, the application of reheat causes the operating point on the GG turbine characteristic to shift to a lower pressure ratio as the amount of reheat increases.

This means that for a given turbine entry temperature \( T_3 \) and pressure \( P_3 \), the flow through the turbine does not change, even if there are variations in other operating conditions.

As a result, the choked condition stabilizes the flow characteristics, allowing for predictable performance metrics. This constancy is critical during operations such as reheat, where the turbine entry temperature \( T_3 \) can increase due to the application of reheat, leading to an increase in the compressor pressure ratio \( P_2/P_1 \). Consequently, while the non-dimensional flow remains constant, the overall efficiency and power output of the gas turbine can be optimized by managing the turbine entry conditions effectively. 

In summary, choked gas generator turbine conditions ensure that the non-dimensional flow characteristics remain stable, which is essential for maintaining performance during varying operational scenarios, such as reheat applications."
