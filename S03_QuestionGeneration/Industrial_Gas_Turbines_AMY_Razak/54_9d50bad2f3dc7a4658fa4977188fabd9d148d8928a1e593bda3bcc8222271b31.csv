Q – W = 0

Hence, for an ideal isothermal process, the heat transfer equals the work transfer as described by Equation 3.26 above.

The ideal Ericsson cycle may be described on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.33. The thermodynamic processes involved in the cycle are:

- 1–2 isothermal compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isothermal expansion
- 4–1 constant pressure heat rejection.

The heat rejected (4–1) by the Ericsson cycle may be transferred via a heat exchanger to supply all the constant pressure heat addition (2–3). Thus the net heat supplied in the Ericsson cycle is the heat transfer during isothermal expansion (3–4) and equals W = RT₃ ln (Prₒ).

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The ideal net work done by the Ericsson cycle is:

Wₙₑₜ = RT₃ ln(Prₒ) – RT₁ ln (Prₒ)

Thus, the ideal thermal efficiency of the Ericsson cycle is:

ηₜₕ  = RT³ ln (Prᵒ ) – RT¹ln ( Prᵒ)

RT3 ln ( Pro)

This reduces to:

ηₜₕ  = 1  –T¹                                                [3.27]

Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of the Ericsson cycle is independent of pressure ratio and only depends on the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, T₃ and T₁, respectively, and is equal to the Carnot efficiency. This is not entirely surprising as all the heat is supplied at the highest cycle temperature and all the heat is rejected at the lowest cycle temperature. This is indeed the Carnot requirement for maximum thermal efficiency and hence the Carnot efficiency is achieved. It should be pointed out that this is in contrast with the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, whose thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and is independent of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Other cycles have been previously encountered that can achieve the Carnot efficiency but these were at some limit condition when the work done by the cycle is zero. The Ericsson cycle, however, produces positive net work and therefore is of practical importance. It is possible to replace the constant pressure heat addition and heat rejection processes by constant volume heat addition and heat rejection. When this is done, the cycle is known as the Stirling cycle and it, too, is capable of achieving the Carnot efficiency. The Ericsson cycle may be implemented using gas turbine engines and the Stirling cycle finds applications in reciprocating engines.

There are two other gas powered cycles that are capable of attaining the Carnot cycle and they are both modified forms of the Ericsson and Stirling cycle. The modified Ericsson cycle consists of an isothermal compression process followed by an isentropic compression process. Heat is added at constant pressure followed by an isothermal expansion. The isothermal expansion is then followed by a constant pressure heat rejection process, which is then followed by an isentropic expansion, as illustrated in Fig. 3.34. It is necessary that the isothermal compression and expansion processes are of equal pressure ratio and therefore require that the isentropic compression and expansion pressure ratios are also equal. A heat exchanger is employed to transfer the constant pressure heat rejection process (5–6) to the constant pressure heat addition process (3–4). In the case of the modified Stirling

3.34 Temperature–entropy diagram for modified Ericsson cycle.

The following list summarises the thermodynamic processes present in the modified Ericsson cycle:

- 1–2 isothermal compression
- 2–3 isentropic compression
- 3–4 constant pressure heat addition
- 4–5 isothermal expansion
- 5–6 constant pressure heat rejection
- 6–1 isentropic expansion.

Since a heat exchanger transfers all the constant pressure heat rejection 5–6 to supply all the constant pressure heat addition 3–4, all the heat is supplied at the maximum cycle temperature T₄ and all the heat rejection occurs at the minimum cycle temperature T₁. Hence the thermal efficiency of the modified Ericsson cycle corresponds to the Carnot efficiency:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹ / T₄

It can be argued that these modified cycles are a general case of the Ericsson and Stirling cycles since only when the isentropic compression and expansion pressure ratios tend to unity do these modified cycles approach the Ericsson.

# 3.4.1 Practical Ericsson cycle

In practice, approximate isothermal compression involves many stages of intercooling and such compressors have been developed for application in the process industry. Typically, they consist of three or four stages of intercooling and are often referred to as isotherm compressors. Isothermal expanders for gas turbines are rare and, when developed, may consist of three or four stages of reheat. Furthermore, the thermodynamic processes in a practical cycle are not reversible. ",What practical applications do the Ericsson and Stirling cycles have?,"The Ericsson cycle is implemented in gas turbine engines, and the Stirling cycle is used in reciprocating engines.","Gas turbine engines utilize the Ericsson cycle, while the Stirling cycle finds its application in reciprocating engines.","Applications of the Ericsson cycle include gas turbine engines, whereas the Stirling cycle is applied in reciprocating engines.","The Ericsson cycle is practical in gas turbine engines, and the Stirling cycle is employed in reciprocating engine designs.","In practice, the Ericsson cycle is adapted for gas turbine engines, and the Stirling cycle is utilized within reciprocating engines."

Q – W = 0

Hence, for an ideal isothermal process, the heat transfer equals the work transfer as described by Equation 3.26 above.

The ideal Ericsson cycle may be described on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.33. The thermodynamic processes involved in the cycle are:

- 1–2 isothermal compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isothermal expansion
- 4–1 constant pressure heat rejection.

The heat rejected (4–1) by the Ericsson cycle may be transferred via a heat exchanger to supply all the constant pressure heat addition (2–3). Thus the net heat supplied in the Ericsson cycle is the heat transfer during isothermal expansion (3–4) and equals W = RT₃ ln (Prₒ).

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The ideal net work done by the Ericsson cycle is:

Wₙₑₜ = RT₃ ln(Prₒ) – RT₁ ln (Prₒ)

Thus, the ideal thermal efficiency of the Ericsson cycle is:

ηₜₕ  = RT³ ln (Prᵒ ) – RT¹ln ( Prᵒ)

RT3 ln ( Pro)

This reduces to:

ηₜₕ  = 1  –T¹                                                [3.27]

Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of the Ericsson cycle is independent of pressure ratio and only depends on the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, T₃ and T₁, respectively, and is equal to the Carnot efficiency. This is not entirely surprising as all the heat is supplied at the highest cycle temperature and all the heat is rejected at the lowest cycle temperature. This is indeed the Carnot requirement for maximum thermal efficiency and hence the Carnot efficiency is achieved. It should be pointed out that this is in contrast with the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, whose thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and is independent of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Other cycles have been previously encountered that can achieve the Carnot efficiency but these were at some limit condition when the work done by the cycle is zero. The Ericsson cycle, however, produces positive net work and therefore is of practical importance. It is possible to replace the constant pressure heat addition and heat rejection processes by constant volume heat addition and heat rejection. When this is done, the cycle is known as the Stirling cycle and it, too, is capable of achieving the Carnot efficiency. The Ericsson cycle may be implemented using gas turbine engines and the Stirling cycle finds applications in reciprocating engines.
