# 18.2.7 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

Since the level of compressor fouling in this case is the same as that applied to the high-power operating case, the shift in the running line is very similar. As operation is at the same compressor non-dimensional speed and the steepness of the compressor speed lines are the same, therefore, the operating points.
