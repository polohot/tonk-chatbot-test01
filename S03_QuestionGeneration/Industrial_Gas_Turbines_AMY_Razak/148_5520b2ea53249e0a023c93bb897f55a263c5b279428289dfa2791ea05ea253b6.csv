# Diagnostics

Fault indices, which represent the change in component (compressor and turbine) characteristics usually due to faults, indicate a faulty engine component. In diagnostics the cause of the fault needs to be determined. A number of causes have been stated that can result in gas turbine performance deterioration in the introduction of this chapter. Diagnostics attempts to detect one or more of these causes that is responsible for the deterioration of engine performance.

Trends in fault indices are an effective means of diagnosing performance-related problems as they show changes with component characteristics in time and satisfy the third requirement of gas turbine performance monitoring systems (diagnostics). For example, compressor fouling will display a trend similar to that shown in Fig. 9.15. If the low pressure (LP) stages of the compressor have also rubbed, resulting in increased clearance between the rotor tip and the casing, the trends in compressor fault indices would be similar to those shown in Fig. 9.16. Since the LP stage of an axial compressor controls the flow capacity at normal operating speeds, any increase tip casing clearance will affect the flow capacity and efficiency adversely, as discussed in Section 9.4. The trends in compressor fouling indices will leave an offset.

# Diagnostics

Fault indices, which represent the change in component (compressor and turbine) characteristics usually due to faults, indicate a faulty engine component. In diagnostics the cause of the fault needs to be determined. A number of causes have been stated that can result in gas turbine performance deterioration in the introduction of this chapter. Diagnostics attempts to detect one or more of these causes that is responsible for the deterioration of engine performance.

Trends in fault indices are an effective means of diagnosing performance-related problems as they show changes with component characteristics in time and satisfy the third requirement of gas turbine performance monitoring systems (diagnostics). For example, compressor fouling will display a trend similar to that shown in Fig. 9.15. If the low pressure (LP) stages of the compressor have also rubbed, resulting in increased clearance between the rotor tip and the casing, the trends in compressor fault indices would be similar to those shown in Fig. 9.16. Since the LP stage of an axial compressor controls the flow capacity at normal operating speeds, any increase tip casing clearance will affect the flow capacity and efficiency adversely, as discussed in Section 9.4. The trends in compressor fouling indices will leave an offset.
