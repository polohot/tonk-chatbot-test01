2. The difference between the measured compressor exit pressure and the model
3. The difference between the measured compressor exit temperature and the model

These simulators allow for the modeling of faulty engines by incorporating various fault indices that represent changes in component characteristics due to faults. 

The process involves the following steps:

1. **Fault Indices Definition**: Fault indices are defined for different components of the gas turbine, such as compressor and turbine fouling and efficiency indices. These indices quantify the extent of performance deterioration.

2. **Fault Injection**: The simulators enable the introduction or ""planting"" of specific faults into the model. This means that the simulator can replicate the effects of real-world faults by adjusting the fault indices accordingly.

3. **Measurement Generation**: Once faults are injected into the model, the simulator generates measurements that reflect the performance-related faults. These measurements include differences between actual performance metrics (like exit temperatures, pressures, and fuel flow) and the expected values from the model.

4. **Performance Monitoring Systems Development**: The generated data can then be used to develop performance-monitoring systems. By analyzing trends in the fault indices over time, engineers can diagnose performance-related problems and identify the underlying causes of faults.

In summary, by using fault indices within virtual simulators, it is possible to create realistic scenarios of gas turbine performance deterioration, allowing for effective analysis and monitoring of engine health."

The primary objectives of diagnostics include:

1. **Fault Detection**: Diagnostics aim to identify whether a fault exists in the engine components by monitoring the trends in fault indices over time. These indices indicate deviations from expected performance, suggesting potential issues.

2. **Cause Identification**: Once a fault is detected, diagnostics seek to determine the specific cause of the performance deterioration. This involves analyzing the trends in fault indices to correlate them with known causes of gas turbine performance issues, such as compressor fouling or mechanical rubs.

3. **Trend Analysis**: By observing the trends in fault indices, diagnostics can provide insights into the nature and severity of the faults. For instance, a consistent trend in compressor fouling indices can indicate ongoing fouling issues, while changes in indices due to mechanical rubs would suggest different underlying problems.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Diagnostics contribute to the overall performance monitoring systems of gas turbines by fulfilling the requirement to understand the causes of performance degradation. This enables operators to take corrective actions before the issues lead to significant operational impacts.

In contrast, labyrinth seal damage does not affect the turbine flow capacity, meaning it may not lead to the same level of performance deterioration as hot end damage. Thus, while both types of damage can result in faults, hot end damage has a more significant negative impact on turbine performance compared to labyrinth seal damage."

Specifically, the turbine fouling fault index is likely to increase, showing a rise from 0% at the start to higher percentages as operating hours accumulate. This suggests that as the turbine operates longer, it experiences more fouling, which negatively impacts its efficiency. Additionally, the presence of hot end damage is expected to further exacerbate these trends, leading to an increase in both the turbine fouling fault index and the turbine efficiency fault index. In contrast, labyrinth seal damage does not affect the turbine flow capacity, but it may still contribute to overall fault indices. Therefore, overall, as operating hours increase, we can expect an upward trend in turbine fault indices, indicating worsening performance."
