In power generation applications, the set point represents the required power output from the generator. In mechanical drive applications, it could refer to parameters such as discharge or suction pressure, compressor speed, or inlet flow of the compressor. The control system adjusts the fuel flow to the engine to ensure that the actual output aligns with the set point, thereby maintaining optimal performance and preventing any exceedance of design limits."

If the actual power output is less than the set point, the control system calculates the error as a percentage deviation from the set point. This error is then used as input to the control system, which alters the fuel flow to the engine accordingly. By increasing the fuel flow, the system aims to raise the power output until it matches the set point, thereby reducing the error to zero and achieving steady state."

In this type of system, the input is applied for a certain period of time, after which the output is expected to reach the required set point. However, the output seldom actually reaches the set point, often resulting in an offset between the output and the desired set point. This means that the system does not adjust or correct itself based on the output, leading to potential discrepancies in achieving the desired performance."

This process allows the closed loop system to adjust the input (such as fuel flow) to eliminate the offset. The error is calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point, and it is used to control the system's output, ensuring that the actual output corresponds to the set point. By continuously adjusting based on the error, the closed loop system aims to reduce the error to zero, achieving steady state performance."

\[
\text{Error} = \frac{\text{Set point} - \text{Power output}}{\text{Set point}} \times 100

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Error} = \frac{15 \text{ MW} - 10 \text{ MW}}{15 \text{ MW}} \times 100 = \frac{5 \text{ MW}}{15 \text{ MW}} \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\%
\]

Thus, the percentage error is approximately **33.33%**."

In the context of gas turbine control systems, this means that if there is an error (the difference between the generator output and the set point), the control system will modify the fuel input to the engine to reduce this error. 

By using negative feedback, the control system can effectively eliminate offsets, ensuring that the output aligns with the set point over time. This process helps to stabilize the system, improve accuracy, and enhance performance by dynamically responding to changes in load or operating conditions. Ultimately, the negative feedback loop is crucial for achieving steady-state operation and protecting the engine from exceeding design limits, thereby ensuring safe and efficient operation of the gas turbine."

In an open loop system, the input (such as fuel flow) is independent of the output, often resulting in a persistent offset between the actual output and the set point. 

In contrast, a closed loop system measures this offset and converts it into an error value, calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point. This error is then used as input to the controller, which adjusts the fuel flow or other control variables to minimize the error. By continuously monitoring the output and making adjustments based on the feedback, the closed loop system can drive the output toward the set point, effectively eliminating the offset and achieving steady state."

This adjustment is made to ensure that the desired power output is achieved. In a closed loop control system, the difference between the actual output and the set point is calculated as an error. This error is then used as input to the controller, which adjusts the fuel valves to modify the power output from the gas turbine. The goal is to reduce the error to zero, achieving steady state where the output matches the set point."

The control system continuously adjusts the input (such as fuel flow) based on the calculated error, which is the percentage deviation from the set point. This adjustment continues until the output matches the set point, resulting in no error."
Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,162,ea24f7378ecd5927f5f61d35eeb6382d3fbdf6a5cd31c987ef755e56aaa7c3cf,How does the control system ensure that the generator output corresponds to the set point?,"The control system ensures that the generator output corresponds to the set point by using a closed loop control mechanism. In this system, the output (generator output) is continuously monitored and compared to the desired set point (required power output). If there is a difference between the two, referred to as the error, this error is calculated as a percentage deviation from the set point.

For example, if the generator output is lower than the set point, the control system will adjust the fuel flow to the gas turbine to increase the power output. This adjustment is made until the error is reduced to zero, meaning the generator output matches the set point. The closed loop control system effectively eliminates any offset by using the error as input to the controller, ensuring that the output aligns with the desired set point through a process of negative feedback."

The control system adjusts the fuel flow based on the difference between the actual power output (from the generator) and the desired set point. When the control system detects that the output is below the set point, it increases the fuel input to the combustor to generate more energy. Conversely, if the output exceeds the set point, the fuel input is decreased. This relationship ensures that the combustor receives the appropriate amount of fuel to maintain the desired power output and operate efficiently within design limits."

By continuously monitoring the power output and adjusting the fuel flow to achieve the desired set point, the control system prevents conditions that could lead to compressor surge. Specifically, it utilizes feedback mechanisms to maintain the appropriate operating conditions, thereby avoiding situations where the compressor might exceed its safe operational limits. This proactive adjustment helps to stabilize the system and mitigate the risk of surge."

This error serves as the input to the controller, which then adjusts the fuel flow to the engine through the fuel valves. 

Specifically, if the actual power output is less than the set point, resulting in a positive error, the control system will increase the fuel flow to the gas turbine to boost the power output and reduce the error. Conversely, if the actual power output exceeds the set point, the control system will decrease the fuel flow to lower the power output. By continuously monitoring and adjusting the fuel flow based on the calculated error, the control system aims to eliminate the error and achieve steady-state operation where the actual output matches the set point."
