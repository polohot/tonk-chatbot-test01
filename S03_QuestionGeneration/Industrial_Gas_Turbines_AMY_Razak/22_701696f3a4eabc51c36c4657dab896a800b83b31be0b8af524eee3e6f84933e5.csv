Calculating the work for the polytropic process involves the summation of the work for each step. To calculate the work for each infinitesimal step, we use the isentropic analysis discussed in Section 2.8.2.

For a compression process:

ηp = dT′ [2.32]

dT

dT′ is the ideal temperature rise, dT is the actual temperature rise for each step

ηₚ is now the polytropic efficiency.

For an isentropic process:

where P is the pressure, and

γ = cp/cv

This equation in differential form is given by

dT′ = (γ – 1) dP

T = γ × P [2.34]

Substituting dT′ from Equation 2.34 into Equation 2.32:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

η × dT γ – 1 dP [2.35]

p T = γ × P

Integrating Equation 2.35:

ηp = ⎜        1  ⎝ [2.36]

Given the polytropic efficiency and pressure ratio, the compressor discharge temperature can be calculated from:

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

ln⌈ T⁴ ⌉

ηp =         ⎜ T₃ ⎝ γ –1 [2.38]

⌈ ln ⌈ P₄ ⌉⌉  γ

The expander exit temperature is calculated from:

⌈ P ⌉ ηp (γ –1)

T₄  = T₃ ⎜ P⁴  ⎝    γ [2.39]

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

For a compressor, the isentropic efficiency is

T   – T        T₂′  – 1

ηc =   2′   1  =  T1 [2.40]

T₂  – T₁      T₂  – 1

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

# 30 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

Similarly, it can be shown that, for a turbine, the isentropic efficiency will increase with pressure ratio and this is due to the reheating of the gas entering the next turbine stage due to the losses in the previous stage.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)). ",How does the isentropic efficiency of a turbine change with pressure ratio according to 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,"The isentropic efficiency of a turbine increases with the pressure ratio, as shown by ηₜ = 1 - (P₄/P₃)^(ηₚ (γ-1)/γ) / 1 - (P₄/P₃)^((γ-1)/γ), for a given polytropic efficiency ηₚ.","In the book, the turbine's isentropic efficiency ηₜ is shown to rise with increasing pressure ratio, derived from the relationship involving polytropic efficiency ηₚ and the heat capacity ratio γ.","The book illustrates that the isentropic efficiency of a turbine, ηₜ, grows as the pressure ratio increases, based on the formula involving ηₚ and γ.","According to the book, a turbine's isentropic efficiency ηₜ escalates with the pressure ratio, as per the equation that includes polytropic efficiency ηₚ and γ.","The book explains that the isentropic efficiency ηₜ of a turbine enhances with the pressure ratio, through the relationship that incorporates ηₚ and γ."

Calculating the work for the polytropic process involves the summation of the work for each step.

For a compression process:

Substituting dT′ from Equation 2.34 into Equation 2.32:

Integrating Equation 2.35:

Given the polytropic efficiency and pressure ratio, the compressor discharge temperature can be calculated from:

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

The expander exit temperature is calculated from:

⌈ P ⌉ ηp (γ –1)

T₄  = T₃ ⎜ P⁴  ⎝    γ [2.39]

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

For a compressor, the isentropic efficiency is

T   – T        T₂′  – 1

ηc =   2′   1  =  T1 [2.40]

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand.

Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor.

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

For a compressor, the isentropic efficiency is

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)). ","According to 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles', how is the expander exit temperature calculated?","The expander exit temperature T₄ is calculated using T₄ = T₃ (P₄/P₃)^(ηₚ (γ-1)/γ), where T₃ is the inlet temperature, P₄/P₃ is the pressure ratio, γ is the heat capacity ratio, and ηₚ is the polytropic efficiency.","In the book, the formula T₄ = T₃ (P₄/P₃)^(ηₚ (γ-1)/γ) is provided for determining the expander exit temperature, based on inlet temperature, pressure ratio, γ, and ηₚ.","The book specifies that the expander exit temperature can be found with T₄ = T₃ (P₄/P₃)^(ηₚ (γ-1)/γ), utilizing the inlet temperature, pressure ratio, γ, and polytropic efficiency.","To calculate the expander's exit temperature, the book offers the equation T₄ = T₃ (P₄/P₃)^(ηₚ (γ-1)/γ), which depends on the inlet temperature, pressure ratio, γ, and ηₚ.","The book details the calculation of expander exit temperature as T₄ = T₃ (P₄/P₃)^(ηₚ (γ-1)/γ), highlighting the roles of inlet temperature, pressure ratio, γ, and polytropic efficiency."
