which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened. The VIGV remains fully open until the ambient temperature has decreased to about –10 degrees Celsius.

VIGV control. The closure of the VIGV endeavours to maintain a constant EGT at its corresponding set point as shown in Fig. 16.17. Figure 16.20 shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VIGV and the operating point on the compressor characteristic at the end of this ambient temperature transient. The figure shows the change in compressor speed lines as patches due to the closure of the VIGV. The shift in the compressor surge line due to the closure of the VIGV is also shown. The shift in the surge line is only approximate.

The effect of the VIGV closure on the compressor characteristic is illustrated schematically in Fig. 16.21. The closure of the VIGV shifts the lines of constant non-dimensional speed and the surge line to the left. This results in a reduction in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow for each compressor non-dimensional speed. The running line is also superimposed on the compressor characteristic. Note that the running line tends to match the compressor characteristic at lower efficiency contours when the VIGV is closed. It must be pointed out that the shift of the surge line due to the closure of the VIGV is generally less distinct at the high speed part of the compressor characteristic. This is because the surge conditions are produced by the stalling of the HP stages rather than by the LP stages at high compressor speeds. At low compressor speeds, it is the stalling of the LP stages that cause surge, and therefore the closure of the VIGV under low speed conditions.

# 16.3.4 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The constant speed of the gas turbine and the reduction in ambient temperature results in a continuous increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed as observed in Fig. 16.22, which shows the trends in non-dimensional speeds and VIGV position during this transient. The turbine entry temperature, T₃ is also observed to decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, as discussed in Section 16.3.1. Since the gas turbine speed is constant, the turbine non-dimensional speed increases. However, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant to maintain a constant EGT during the period when the VIGV closes. Thus the turbine non-dimensional speed remains approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

The figure also shows the trend of the VIGV position. It is observed that VIGV starts to close as the EGT attempts to fall below the temperature set point (650 K) when VIGV control is active. The VIGV is about 43% opened at the end of the ambient temperature transient.

As the temperature, T₁, decreases during this transient, the mass flow rate through the compressor increases. It is also observed that, during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, the compressor pressure ratio increases while the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, decreases as shown in Fig. 16.16.

VIGV control. The closure of the VIGV endeavours to maintain a constant EGT at its corresponding set point as shown in Fig. 16.17. Figure 16.20 shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VIGV and the operating point on the compressor characteristic at the end of this ambient temperature transient. The figure shows the change in compressor speed lines as patches due to the closure of the VIGV. The shift in the compressor surge line due to the closure of the VIGV is also shown. The shift in the surge line is only approximate.

The effect of the VIGV closure on the compressor characteristic is illustrated schematically in Fig. 16.21. The closure of the VIGV shifts the lines of constant non-dimensional speed and the surge line to the left. This results in a reduction in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow for each compressor non-dimensional speed. The running line is also superimposed on the compressor characteristic. Note that the running line tends to match the compressor characteristic at lower efficiency contours when the VIGV is closed. It must be pointed out that the shift of the surge line due to the closure of the VIGV is generally less distinct at the high speed part of the compressor characteristic. This is because the surge conditions are produced by the stalling of the HP stages rather than by the LP stages at high compressor speeds. At low compressor speeds, it is the stalling of the LP stages that cause surge, and therefore the closure of the VIGV under low speed conditions.

# 16.3.4 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The constant speed of the gas turbine and the reduction in ambient temperature results in a continuous increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed as observed in Fig. 16.22, which shows the trends in non-dimensional speeds and VIGV position during this transient. The turbine entry temperature, T₃ is also observed to decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, as discussed in Section 16.3.1. Since the gas turbine speed is constant, the turbine non-dimensional speed increases. However, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant to maintain a constant EGT during the period when the VIGV closes. Thus the turbine non-dimensional speed remains approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

The figure also shows the trend of the VIGV position. It is observed that VIGV starts to close as the EGT attempts to fall below the temperature set point (650 K) when VIGV control is active. The VIGV is about 43% opened at the end of the ambient temperature transient.
