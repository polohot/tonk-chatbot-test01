Industrial_Gas_Turbines_AMY_Razak.txt,196,2f4ea46f1a3f489dd8af68b4707d8543dcdc3a5b6bceb106e184370785a54d39,How can the increase in NOx and CO levels be interpreted in the context of engine performance?,"The increase in NOx and CO levels can be interpreted as indicators of changes in engine performance. Specifically, an increase in NOx suggests that the combustion process is producing higher levels of nitrogen oxides, which typically occurs under conditions of high combustion temperatures and pressures. This can indicate that the engine is operating less efficiently, particularly at lower ambient temperatures where performance is constrained. 

On the other hand, the increase in CO levels, although noted to be much lower than NOx, implies a potential loss in combustion efficiency. CO is a byproduct of incomplete combustion, and significant increases in CO levels could signal that the engine is not burning fuel as effectively as it should. Therefore, while NOx levels may rise due to increased combustion pressure, the concurrent increase in CO levels may indicate that the engine is not achieving optimal combustion efficiency, especially under constrained operating conditions. Overall, these emissions metrics reflect the balance between combustion efficiency and engine performance, highlighting areas where improvements may be needed."
