NOₓ has been associated with the formation of acid rain and smog, and it has also been associated with the depletion of the ozone layer.

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Although DLE combustion systems have reduced emissions of NOx, CO and UHC appreciably, for a given fuel, the reduction of CO2 and H2O can only be achieved by improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbines without resorting to carbon capture and storage. To achieve this improvement, combined cycle and co-generation systems, where the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilised to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant, are now in operation. These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air. The above methods of carbon capture and storage are discussed in Andersen et al.3 and in Griffiths et al.4

The use of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells, in combination with gas turbines, can also be used to capture CO2 by keeping the CO2 stream and the water vapour streams separate. This is achieved by avoiding mixing the cathode and anode exit streams as the anode stream in principle is a mixture of CO2, water vapour and some unused fuel. ",What are the primary pollutants associated with combustion systems using hydrocarbon fuels?,"The primary pollutants are CO, UHC, NOₓ, CO₂, and H₂O.","Combustion systems emit CO and UHC due to poor combustion, NOₓ linked to acid rain and smog, and CO₂ and H₂O as greenhouse gases.","From hydrocarbon fuel combustion, the main pollutants include toxic CO, UHC that forms smog with NOₓ, and greenhouse gases CO₂ and H₂O.","Pollutants like CO (poisonous), UHC (toxic and smog-forming with NOₓ), and greenhouse gases CO₂ and H₂O are produced.","Hydrocarbon combustion results in emissions of CO, UHC, NOₓ, plus CO₂ and H₂O, contributing to pollution and global warming."

These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air. The above methods of carbon capture and storage are discussed in Andersen et al.3 and in Griffiths et al.4

The use of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells, in combination with gas turbines, can also be used to capture CO2 by keeping the CO2 stream and the water vapour streams separate. This is achieved by avoiding mixing the cathode and anode exit streams as the anode stream in principle is a mixture of CO2, water vapour and some unused fuel. ",How does the oxyfuel method of carbon capture and storage work?,"It involves burning fuel in oxygen, producing only CO2 which is then captured and stored.","By combusting fuel in pure oxygen, the sole emission is CO2, ready for capture and storage.","Oxyfuel combustion results in CO2 as the only gaseous product, which is captured and stored.","This method burns fuel in oxygen, isolating CO2 for capture, with no other emissions.","Fuel is burned in oxygen, generating pure CO2 that's captured, preventing atmospheric release."

NOₓ has been associated with the formation of acid rain and smog, and it has also been associated with the depletion of the ozone layer. CO is a poisonous gas whereas UHC is not only toxic but UHCs also combine with NOₓ to produce smog. Combustion systems that use hydrocarbon fuels produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapour (H₂O) due to the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen. Although CO₂ and H₂O are considered non-toxic, they are greenhouse gases and have been associated with global warming.

# 8 Industrial gas turbines

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Although DLE combustion systems have reduced emissions of NOx, CO and UHC appreciably, for a given fuel, the reduction of CO2 and H2O can only be achieved by improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbines without resorting to carbon capture and storage. To achieve this improvement, combined cycle and co-generation systems, where the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilised to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant, are now in operation. These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.
