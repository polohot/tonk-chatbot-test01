NOₓ is associated with the formation of acid rain, which occurs when nitrogen oxides react with water vapor in the atmosphere to produce nitric acid. This acid can then fall to the ground with precipitation, leading to harmful effects on ecosystems, water bodies, and soil.

Additionally, NOₓ plays a significant role in the formation of smog. It reacts with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight to produce ground-level ozone, a key component of smog. This can lead to poor air quality, which poses health risks to humans and can harm vegetation and wildlife. Therefore, the presence of NOₓ in the atmosphere is a critical factor in the development of both acid rain and smog, contributing to broader environmental degradation and health issues."

In the context of gas turbine power plants, this technique involves capturing CO2 from the exhaust gases produced during combustion.

The process typically works as follows:

1. **Combustion**: In a gas turbine, hydrocarbon fuels are burned to produce energy, resulting in the emission of gases, including CO2.

2. **Capture**: After combustion, the exhaust gases, which contain CO2, are directed to a carbon capture system. This system often uses solvents, such as methanol amine (MEA), to absorb the CO2 from the flue gases.

3. **Storage**: Once the CO2 is captured, it can be compressed and transported to a storage site, where it is stored underground in geological formations, preventing it from being released into the atmosphere.

The process can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Fuel Conversion**: Natural gas is subjected to a process where it is converted into CO and H₂. This is typically done through a reforming process, where steam (H₂O) is added to the natural gas in the presence of a catalyst.

2. **Water Gas Shift Reaction**: In this step, the CO produced is further reacted with steam to produce additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO₂). This reaction is known as the water gas shift reaction.

3. **CO₂ Capture**: The CO₂ generated during the water gas shift reaction is then captured and stored. This prevents CO₂ from being released into the atmosphere during combustion.

4. **Combustion**: The hydrogen produced from the conversion process is then burned in the gas turbine to generate power, while the CO₂ is kept separate and stored.

By separating the CO₂ before combustion, this method effectively reduces the amount of carbon emissions that would typically result from burning fossil fuels directly."

In traditional combustion methods, fuels are burned in air, which contains nitrogen (N₂) along with oxygen (O₂). This results in the production of a variety of emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), among others.

In contrast, oxyfuel combustion involves burning fuel in a pure oxygen environment rather than air. This significantly reduces the amount of nitrogen in the combustion process, which leads to the following key differences in emissions:

1. **Reduced NOₓ Emissions**: Since nitrogen is not present in the combustion process, the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) is minimized, which is a major contributor to smog and acid rain.

2. **CO₂ Emissions**: The primary gaseous emission from oxyfuel combustion is carbon dioxide (CO₂), as the combustion process produces CO₂ and water vapor (H₂O). However, because the combustion occurs in a controlled environment, the CO₂ can be captured and stored more efficiently.

3. **Elimination of Other Pollutants**: Oxyfuel combustion can also lead to lower emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), as the combustion process can be optimized to achieve more complete combustion.
