The decrease in T₃/T₁ shown in Fig. 18.26 results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant during this simulation. The EGT remains on the limit as it prevents the engine from overheating the turbine during high-power operation. Since the compressor is operating at a constant non-dimensional speed, the non-dimensional temperature rise across the compressor does not change much and hence no significant change is seen in the compressor discharge temperature due to hot end damage. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature also results in decreases in the combustor primary zone temperature and in the turbine metal temperature. The trends in these temperatures due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. ",What effect does the decrease in T₃/T₁ have on the turbine entry temperature according to Fig. 18.26?,"The decrease in T₃/T₁ results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃.","As shown in Fig. 18.26, a lower T₃/T₁ ratio leads to a reduction in T₃, the turbine entry temperature.","T₃ decreases when there's a decrease in T₃/T₁, with the compressor inlet temperature remaining constant.","The turbine entry temperature, T₃, is reduced due to the decrease in T₃/T₁, as illustrated in Fig. 18.26.","Fig. 18.26 demonstrates that a decrease in the T₃/T₁ ratio causes the turbine entry temperature, T₃, to drop."
