The figure also shows the trends in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the set point for the power output. In this instance, the power is limited to about 40 MW by the EGT limit. In practice, this would trip the engine due to the shift in the generator frequency resulting from insufficient power available from the gas turbine.

# 20.2 VIGV control when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range

In Section 20.1 the control of the VIGV was discussed when it is fully open during the normal operating power range. The performance of a single-shaft gas turbine has also been discussed when the VIGV is modulating at the normal power range of the gas turbine and maintaining the EGT on its maximum limit (i.e. the EGT set point for VIGV control corresponds to the maximum EGT limit). At first sight, it would appear that increasing the EGT limit for VIGV control to the limiting value required to protect the engine (i.e. increasing the EGT for VIGV control from 650 K to 825 K) would achieve the desired result. However, this presents some difficulties, as the engine may respond unexpectedly, as discussed in Chapter 10.

# 20. Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

If the simulation carried out in Section 20.1 is repeated but with the EGT set point for VIGV control increased to the maximum value of 825 K, the power output from the gas turbine is significantly reduced while the engine is operating on the maximum EGT limit. The maximum power output of the gas turbine should be about 40 MW, but the power output in this instance is restricted to 28 MW and is well short of the required power from the gas turbine as shown in Fig. 20.7. As the power demand from the gas turbine is increased, the EGT increases. However, the EGT is below the VIGV operating set point and the VIGV remains closed. When the EGT exceeds the EGT limit for VIGV operation, the VIGV starts to open. Since the EGT set point for VIGV operation is the maximum permitted value, the low signal selection prevents the VIGV from opening fully, as it endeavours to protect the turbine from over-heating by preventing the EGT from exceeding the maximum value. Thus, the airflow through the compressor is severely restricted and hence the power output from the gas turbine also becomes severely limited.

The restriction of flow through the compressor also results in a reduction in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine, thus reducing the specific work of the gas turbine. The reduction in specific work also contributes significantly to the loss in gas turbine power output due to insufficient opening of the VIGV.

This increase in EGT, T₄, can be seen in Fig. 20.8 and is due to the increase in power demand from the gas turbine. Note that the EGT reaches the limiting value while the VIGV has opened only marginally, as shown in

# 20.2 VIGV control when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range

In Section 20.1 the control of the VIGV was discussed when it is fully open during the normal operating power range. The performance of a single-shaft gas turbine has also been discussed when the VIGV is modulating at the normal power range of the gas turbine and maintaining the EGT on its maximum limit (i.e. the EGT set point for VIGV control corresponds to the maximum EGT limit). At first sight, it would appear that increasing the EGT limit for VIGV control to the limiting value required to protect the engine (i.e. increasing the EGT for VIGV control from 650 K to 825 K) would achieve the desired result. However, this presents some difficulties, as the engine may respond unexpectedly, as discussed in Chapter 10.

# 20. Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

If the simulation carried out in Section 20.1 is repeated but with the EGT set point for VIGV control increased to the maximum value of 825 K, the power output from the gas turbine is significantly reduced while the engine is operating on the maximum EGT limit. The maximum power output of the gas turbine should be about 40 MW, but the power output in this instance is restricted to 28 MW and is well short of the required power from the gas turbine as shown in Fig. 20.7. As the power demand from the gas turbine is increased, the EGT increases. However, the EGT is below the VIGV operating set point and the VIGV remains closed. When the EGT exceeds the EGT limit for VIGV operation, the VIGV starts to open. Since the EGT set point for VIGV operation is the maximum permitted value, the low signal selection prevents the VIGV from opening fully, as it endeavours to protect the turbine from over-heating by preventing the EGT from exceeding the maximum value. Thus, the airflow through the compressor is severely restricted and hence the power output from the gas turbine also becomes severely limited.

The restriction of flow through the compressor also results in a reduction in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine, thus reducing the specific work of the gas turbine. The reduction in specific work also contributes significantly to the loss in gas turbine power output due to insufficient opening of the VIGV.

This increase in EGT, T₄, can be seen in Fig. 20.8 and is due to the increase in power demand from the gas turbine. Note that the EGT reaches the limiting value while the VIGV has opened only marginally, as shown in
