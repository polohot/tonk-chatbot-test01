18.34 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power.

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",What is the effect of hot end damage on the EGT and VIGV in gas turbines?,"Hot end damage increases the EGT, leading to the opening of the VIGV to maintain the EGT at its limit.","The VIGV opens as a result of increased EGT from hot end damage, keeping the EGT at the set point.","Due to hot end damage, EGT rises, prompting the VIGV control system to open and stabilize EGT.","An increase in EGT caused by hot end damage triggers the VIGV to open, ensuring EGT remains on its limit.",The VIGV adjusts by opening in response to elevated EGT levels from hot end damage to maintain the EGT limit.

18.34 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power.

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",What trends are observed in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage at high power?,"Emissions trends show variations in NOx, CO2 EI, CO, and CO emissions at different times during high power operation.","At high power, hot end damage affects emissions, with changes in NOx, CO2 EI, CO, and CO emissions over time.","The impact of hot end damage on emissions includes fluctuating levels of NOx, CO2 EI, CO, and CO emissions during high power operation.","High power operation with hot end damage leads to observable trends in NOx, CO2 EI, CO, and CO emissions across various time points.","Trends in emissions, such as NOx, CO2 EI, CO, and CO, vary over time when operating at high power with hot end damage."
