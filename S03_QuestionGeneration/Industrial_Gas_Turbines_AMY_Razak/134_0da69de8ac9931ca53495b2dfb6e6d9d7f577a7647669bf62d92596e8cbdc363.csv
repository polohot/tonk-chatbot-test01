Since the engine operates at a constant LP spool speed, for a given ambient temperature, T₁, the flow rate through the compressor and the LP compressor discharge temperature, T₂, remain approximately constant. Hence the increase in power output from the gas turbine must be accomplished by increasing the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and general overall pressure ratio, P₃/P₁ (i.e. increase in specific work). Since the LP compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the HP compressor inlet temperature, is approximately constant, an increase in T₄ will result in an increase in T₄/T₂. From Fig. 8.20, the operating point would move along the HP running line from a low to a higher HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio, P₃/P₂. Thus a higher HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow must result in a decrease in the LP compressor pressure.

Hence lines of constant gas turbine power output can be produced on the LP compressor characteristic similar to those shown in Fig. 8.4, which presents the case for a single shaft gas turbine – the exception being that the lines of constant power move away from surge with increase in power as shown in Fig. 8.21. Unlike the case for the HP compressor, there is no unique running line on the LP compressor, and the running line is determined by the power output and ambient conditions.

Since the lines of constant power move away from surge as the power output from the gas turbine increases, it is possible that the zero load line on the LP compressor characteristic will be in the compressor surge region and therefore make the gas turbine impossible to start. Implementing blow-off at the LP compressor discharge will enable the starting of the engine. Considering the flow compatibility in Equation 8.9, blow-off will decrease W₂/W₁. For a given demand of HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow (i.e. W₂√T₂/P₂ is constant), any decrease in W₂/W₁ must be accompanied by a decrease in the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, thus shifting the running line away from surge. The blow-off may remain open until adequate power demand has occurred, thereby shifting the running line sufficiently away from surge enabling the blow-off to be closed. Incorporating variable stators and VIGVs will also help shift the LP compressor running line away from surge. By closing these guide vanes during starting and low power operation, the turbine entry temperature is increased for a given LP compressor non-dimensional speed. As explained in Section 8.4, the LP compressor running line will move away from surge, thus easing the start-up of the gas.

# 8.6 Running lines of gas turbine complex cycles

The design point and off-design performance of complex cycles incorporating intercooling, regeneration and reheat have been discussed. The off-design performance of complex cycles using regeneration is very similar to that discussed above, the main difference being the increased pressure losses in the heating and exhaust part of the gas turbine cycle. Intercooling and reheat affect the off-design performance of the gas turbine differently from that discussed previously and depend on the engine configuration (i.e. single shaft, free power turbine, etc.). Discussion, however, will be restricted to only that which is noteworthy.

# 8.6.1 Intercooled single-shaft gas turbine

The off-design behaviour of an intercooled single-shaft gas turbine may be understood by dividing the process into two parts. The HP compressor and the turbine can be treated as a simple cycle single-shaft engine and therefore the off-design behaviour of this part of the gas turbine is similar to that discussed in Section 8.1.1. The HP compressor inlet temperature T₃ in Fig. 8.22, which shows a schematic representation of an intercooled single shaft gas turbine, will remain constant due to intercooling. Hence, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will approach surge along a line of

constant non-dimensional speed as the engine load is increased. Since it is assumed that the constant speed line on the compressor characteristic is approximately vertical, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₃√T₃/P₃, will also be approximately constant. The flow compatibility between the inlet and exit of the intercooler gives:

W3PT3 = W2PT2 × P2 × T3 × W3

[8.10]

It has been shown that W√T/P is approximately constant and T3 is controlled by the intercooler and is also assumed to be constant. Since the gas turbine is constrained to operate at a constant speed, for a given LP compressor inlet temperature, T1, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed will remain constant with engine load changes. It has been stated previously that, at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow and discharge temperature does not vary much and can be assumed to be approximately constant. Making these assumptions and also assuming a constant intercooler pressure loss, P2/P3, and ignoring bleeds (i.e. W3 = W2), we may conclude from Equation 8.10 that the LP compressor discharge non-dimensional flow, W2√T2/P2 is also approximately constant.

The flow compatibility equation between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor is:

W2PT2 = W1PT1 × P1 × T2 × W2

[8.11]

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

Change in the ambient temperature results in the LP compressor operating on a different non-dimensional speed. However, the operating point on this LP compressor non-dimensional speed will be unique for the reasons discussed. Thus it is possible to join these operating points and generate a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. 8.23. The change in the ambient temperature will also result in a change in the intercooled discharge temperature, and hence a change in the HP compressor inlet temperature, T3. Therefore, the operating line on the HP compressor characteristic will change with power output and ambient temperature in a manner similar to that of a simple cycle single-shaft gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 8.4. Thus, no unique running line exists for the HP compressor.

A variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) may be included in the LP compressor to control the air flow through the gas turbine, such that the turbine entry

constant non-dimensional speed as the engine load is increased. Since it is assumed that the constant speed line on the compressor characteristic is approximately vertical, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₃√T₃/P₃, will also be approximately constant. The flow compatibility between the inlet and exit of the intercooler gives:

W3PT3 = W2PT2 × P2 × T3 × W3

The flow compatibility equation between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor is:

W2PT2 = W1PT1 × P1 × T2 × W2

[8.11]

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

Change in the ambient temperature results in the LP compressor operating on a different non-dimensional speed. However, the operating point on this LP compressor non-dimensional speed will be unique for the reasons discussed. Thus it is possible to join these operating points and generate a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. 8.23.

Incorporating variable stators and VIGVs will also help shift the LP compressor running line away from surge. By closing these guide vanes during starting and low power operation, the turbine entry temperature is increased for a given LP compressor non-dimensional speed. As explained in Section 8.4, the LP compressor running line will move away from surge, thus easing the start-up of the gas.

# 8.6 Running lines of gas turbine complex cycles

The design point and off-design performance of complex cycles incorporating intercooling, regeneration and reheat have been discussed. The off-design performance of complex cycles using regeneration is very similar to that discussed above, the main difference being the increased pressure losses in the heating and exhaust part of the gas turbine cycle. Intercooling and reheat affect the off-design performance of the gas turbine differently from that discussed previously and depend on the engine configuration (i.e. single shaft, free power turbine, etc.). Discussion, however, will be restricted to only that which is noteworthy.

# 8.6.1 Intercooled single-shaft gas turbine

The off-design behaviour of an intercooled single-shaft gas turbine may be understood by dividing the process into two parts. The HP compressor and the turbine can be treated as a simple cycle single-shaft engine and therefore the off-design behaviour of this part of the gas turbine is similar to that discussed in Section 8.1.1. The HP compressor inlet temperature T₃ in Fig. 8.22, which shows a schematic representation of an intercooled single shaft gas turbine, will remain constant due to intercooling. Hence, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will approach surge along a line of

constant non-dimensional speed as the engine load is increased. Since it is assumed that the constant speed line on the compressor characteristic is approximately vertical, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₃√T₃/P₃, will also be approximately constant. The flow compatibility between the inlet and exit of the intercooler gives:

W3PT3 = W2PT2 × P2 × T3 × W3

[8.10]

It has been shown that W√T/P is approximately constant and T3 is controlled by the intercooler and is also assumed to be constant. Since the gas turbine is constrained to operate at a constant speed, for a given LP compressor inlet temperature, T1, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed will remain constant with engine load changes. It has been stated previously that, at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow and discharge temperature does not vary much and can be assumed to be approximately constant. Making these assumptions and also assuming a constant intercooler pressure loss, P2/P3, and ignoring bleeds (i.e. W3 = W2), we may conclude from Equation 8.10 that the LP compressor discharge non-dimensional flow, W2√T2/P2 is also approximately constant.

The flow compatibility equation between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor is:

W2PT2 = W1PT1 × P1 × T2 × W2

[8.11]

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

Change in the ambient temperature results in the LP compressor operating on a different non-dimensional speed. However, the operating point on this LP compressor non-dimensional speed will be unique for the reasons discussed. Thus it is possible to join these operating points and generate a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. 8.23. The change in the ambient temperature will also result in a change in the intercooled discharge temperature, and hence a change in the HP compressor inlet temperature, T3. Therefore, the operating line on the HP compressor characteristic will change with power output and ambient temperature in a manner similar to that of a simple cycle single-shaft gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 8.4. Thus, no unique running line exists for the HP compressor.

A variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) may be included in the LP compressor to control the air flow through the gas turbine, such that the turbine entry

Since the engine operates at a constant LP spool speed, for a given ambient temperature, T₁, the flow rate through the compressor and the LP compressor discharge temperature, T₂, remain approximately constant. Hence the increase in power output from the gas turbine must be accomplished by increasing the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and general overall pressure ratio, P₃/P₁ (i.e. increase in specific work). Since the LP compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the HP compressor inlet temperature, is approximately constant, an increase in T₄ will result in an increase in T₄/T₂. From Fig. 8.20, the operating point would move along the HP running line from a low to a higher HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio, P₃/P₂. Thus a higher HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow must result in a decrease in the LP compressor pressure.

Hence lines of constant gas turbine power output can be produced on the LP compressor characteristic similar to those shown in Fig. 8.4, which presents the case for a single shaft gas turbine – the exception being that the lines of constant power move away from surge with increase in power as shown in Fig. 8.21. Unlike the case for the HP compressor, there is no unique running line on the LP compressor, and the running line is determined by the power output and ambient conditions.

Since the lines of constant power move away from surge as the power output from the gas turbine increases, it is possible that the zero load line on the LP compressor characteristic will be in the compressor surge region and therefore make the gas turbine impossible to start. Implementing blow-off at the LP compressor discharge will enable the starting of the engine. Considering the flow compatibility in Equation 8.9, blow-off will decrease W₂/W₁. For a given demand of HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow (i.e. W₂√T₂/P₂ is constant), any decrease in W₂/W₁ must be accompanied by a decrease in the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, thus shifting the running line away from surge.

The flow compatibility between the inlet and exit of the intercooler gives:

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

It has been stated previously that, at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow and discharge temperature does not vary much and can be assumed to be approximately constant. Making these assumptions and also assuming a constant intercooler pressure loss, P2/P3, and ignoring bleeds (i.e. W3 = W2), we may conclude from Equation 8.10 that the LP compressor discharge non-dimensional flow, W2√T2/P2 is also approximately constant.

The flow compatibility equation between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor is:

W2PT2 = W1PT1 × P1 × T2 × W2

[8.11]

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

Change in the ambient temperature results in the LP compressor operating on a different non-dimensional speed. However, the operating point on this LP compressor non-dimensional speed will be unique for the reasons discussed. Thus it is possible to join these operating points and generate a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. 8.23. The change in the ambient temperature will also result in a change in the intercooled discharge temperature, and hence a change in the HP compressor inlet temperature, T3. Therefore, the operating line on the HP compressor characteristic will change with power output and ambient temperature in a manner similar to that of a simple cycle single-shaft gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 8.4. Thus, no unique running line exists for the HP compressor.

A variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) may be included in the LP compressor to control the air flow through the gas turbine, such that the turbine entry

Since the engine operates at a constant LP spool speed, for a given ambient temperature, T₁, the flow rate through the compressor and the LP compressor discharge temperature, T₂, remain approximately constant. Hence the increase in power output from the gas turbine must be accomplished by increasing the turbine entry temperature, T₄, and general overall pressure ratio, P₃/P₁ (i.e. increase in specific work). Since the LP compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the HP compressor inlet temperature, is approximately constant, an increase in T₄ will result in an increase in T₄/T₂. From Fig. 8.20, the operating point would move along the HP running line from a low to a higher HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₂√T₂/P₂, and pressure ratio, P₃/P₂. Thus a higher HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow must result in a decrease in the LP compressor pressure.

Hence lines of constant gas turbine power output can be produced on the LP compressor characteristic similar to those shown in Fig. 8.4, which presents the case for a single shaft gas turbine – the exception being that the lines of constant power move away from surge with increase in power as shown in Fig. 8.21. Unlike the case for the HP compressor, there is no unique running line on the LP compressor, and the running line is determined by the power output and ambient conditions.

Since the lines of constant power move away from surge as the power output from the gas turbine increases, it is possible that the zero load line on the LP compressor characteristic will be in the compressor surge region and therefore make the gas turbine impossible to start. Implementing blow-off at the LP compressor discharge will enable the starting of the engine. Considering the flow compatibility in Equation 8.9, blow-off will decrease W₂/W₁. For a given demand of HP compressor inlet non-dimensional flow (i.e. W₂√T₂/P₂ is constant), any decrease in W₂/W₁ must be accompanied by a decrease in the LP compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, thus shifting the running line away from surge. The blow-off may remain open until adequate power demand has occurred, thereby shifting the running line sufficiently away from surge enabling the blow-off to be closed. Incorporating variable stators and VIGVs will also help shift the LP compressor running line away from surge. By closing these guide vanes during starting and low power operation, the turbine entry temperature is increased for a given LP compressor non-dimensional speed. As explained in Section 8.4, the LP compressor running line will move away from surge, thus easing the start-up of the gas.

The design point and off-design performance of complex cycles incorporating intercooling, regeneration and reheat have been discussed. The off-design performance of complex cycles using regeneration is very similar to that discussed above, the main difference being the increased pressure losses in the heating and exhaust part of the gas turbine cycle. Intercooling and reheat affect the off-design performance of the gas turbine differently from that discussed previously and depend on the engine configuration (i.e. single shaft, free power turbine, etc.).

The off-design behaviour of an intercooled single-shaft gas turbine may be understood by dividing the process into two parts. The HP compressor and the turbine can be treated as a simple cycle single-shaft engine and therefore the off-design behaviour of this part of the gas turbine is similar to that discussed in Section 8.1.1. The HP compressor inlet temperature T₃ in Fig. 8.22, which shows a schematic representation of an intercooled single shaft gas turbine, will remain constant due to intercooling.

constant non-dimensional speed as the engine load is increased. Since it is assumed that the constant speed line on the compressor characteristic is approximately vertical, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₃√T₃/P₃, will also be approximately constant. The flow compatibility between the inlet and exit of the intercooler gives:

W3PT3 = W2PT2 × P2 × T3 × W3

[8.10]

It has been shown that W√T/P is approximately constant and T3 is controlled by the intercooler and is also assumed to be constant. Since the gas turbine is constrained to operate at a constant speed, for a given LP compressor inlet temperature, T1, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed will remain constant with engine load changes.

The flow compatibility equation between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor is:

W2PT2 = W1PT1 × P1 × T2 × W2

[8.11]

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

Change in the ambient temperature results in the LP compressor operating on a different non-dimensional speed. However, the operating point on this LP compressor non-dimensional speed will be unique for the reasons discussed. Thus it is possible to join these operating points and generate a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. 8.23. The change in the ambient temperature will also result in a change in the intercooled discharge temperature, and hence a change in the HP compressor inlet temperature, T3. Therefore, the operating line on the HP compressor characteristic will change with power output and ambient temperature in a manner similar to that of a simple cycle single-shaft gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 8.4.

Since it is assumed that the constant speed line on the compressor characteristic is approximately vertical, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₃√T₃/P₃, will also be approximately constant. The flow compatibility between the inlet and exit of the intercooler gives:

W3PT3 = W2PT2 × P2 × T3 × W3

[8.10]

It has been shown that W√T/P is approximately constant and T3 is controlled by the intercooler and is also assumed to be constant. Since the gas turbine is constrained to operate at a constant speed, for a given LP compressor inlet temperature, T1, the LP compressor non-dimensional speed will remain constant with engine load changes.

Making these assumptions and also assuming a constant intercooler pressure loss, P2/P3, and ignoring bleeds (i.e. W3 = W2), we may conclude from Equation 8.10 that the LP compressor discharge non-dimensional flow, W2√T2/P2 is also approximately constant.

The flow compatibility equation between the inlet and discharge of the LP compressor is:

W2PT2 = W1PT1 × P1 × T2 × W2

[8.11]

In Equation 8.11, the non-dimensional flows (W2√T2/P2 and W1√T1/P1), and temperature and flow ratios, T2/T1, and W2/W1 respectively, are approximately constant. Therefore from Equation 8.11, the LP compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1, is also approximately constant.

Change in the ambient temperature results in the LP compressor operating on a different non-dimensional speed. However, the operating point on this LP compressor non-dimensional speed will be unique for the reasons discussed. Thus it is possible to join these operating points and generate a unique running line on the LP compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. 8.23.
