Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine. The running line when no performance deterioration is present is also shown in the figure. The figure also shows the operating points for both these cases.

Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine. The running line when no performance deterioration is present is also shown in the figure. The figure also shows the operating points for both these cases.

The variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 13.36.
