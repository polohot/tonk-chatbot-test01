# 1 Introduction

The history of the gas turbine goes back to 1791, when John Barber took out a patent for ‘A Method for Rising Inflammable Air for the Purposes of Producing Motion and Facilitating Metallurgical Operations’. Many endeavours have been made since then particularly in the early 1900s to build an operational gas turbine. In 1903, a Norwegian, Aegidius Elling, built the first successful gas turbine using a rotary/dynamic compressor and turbines, and is credited with building the first gas turbine that produced excess power of about 8 kW (11 hp). By 1904 Elling had improved his design, achieving exhaust gas temperatures of 773 K (500 degrees Celsius), up from 673 K (400 degrees Celsius), producing about 33 kW (44 hp). ",What is the significance of the year 1791 in the history of gas turbines?,"In 1791, John Barber patented a method for producing motion using inflammable air, marking an early milestone in gas turbine history.",The year 1791 is significant because it was when John Barber filed a patent that laid foundational ideas for gas turbine technology.,"1791 saw the first patent related to gas turbine technology by John Barber, initiating the conceptual development of gas turbines.",John Barber's 1791 patent for producing motion with inflammable air represents the beginning of gas turbine history.,"The history of gas turbines began in 1791 with John Barber's patent, which proposed using inflammable air for motion and metallurgical operations."

# 1 Introduction

The history of the gas turbine goes back to 1791, when John Barber took out a patent for ‘A Method for Rising Inflammable Air for the Purposes of Producing Motion and Facilitating Metallurgical Operations’. Many endeavours have been made since then particularly in the early 1900s to build an operational gas turbine. In 1903, a Norwegian, Aegidius Elling, built the first successful gas turbine using a rotary/dynamic compressor and turbines, and is credited with building the first gas turbine that produced excess power of about 8 kW (11 hp). By 1904 Elling had improved his design, achieving exhaust gas temperatures of 773 K (500 degrees Celsius), up from 673 K (400 degrees Celsius), producing about 33 kW (44 hp). ",What is the role of 'ISO' in gas turbine standards?,"'ISO' stands for 'International Standards Organisation', which sets standards for gas turbines among other technologies.","In gas turbine standards, 'ISO' denotes the 'International Standards Organisation'.","The abbreviation 'ISO' refers to the 'International Standards Organisation', relevant for gas turbine specifications.","'International Standards Organisation' is what 'ISO' stands for, including in the context of gas turbine standards.","For gas turbines, 'ISO' is the acronym for the 'International Standards Organisation', which provides global standards."
