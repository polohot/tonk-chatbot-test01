1. **Increased Efficiency**: Higher EGT can lead to improved thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycle. This is because the efficiency of a gas turbine is often related to the temperature difference between the combustion gases and the ambient air. By increasing the EGT, more energy can be extracted from the combustion process.

2. **Power Output**: Higher exhaust gas temperatures generally allow for greater power output from the turbine. As the temperature increases, the energy available for conversion into mechanical work also increases, enabling the turbine to produce more power.

3. **Material Challenges**: Operating at higher temperatures poses significant challenges for materials used in turbine components. Turbine blades and other components must be made from advanced materials that can withstand the increased thermal stress and potential oxidation at elevated temperatures. This may lead to higher manufacturing costs and the need for more sophisticated cooling techniques.

4. **Emissions Control**: While higher EGT can improve efficiency and power output, it can also lead to increased formation of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which are harmful pollutants. Therefore, gas turbine designs must incorporate effective emissions control technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or dry low emission (DLE) systems, to mitigate these emissions.

5. **Operational Flexibility**: Higher EGT can enhance the operational flexibility of gas turbines, allowing them to adapt to varying load conditions more effectively. This can be particularly beneficial in applications where rapid changes in power demand are common.

6. **Impact on Cycle Design**: The need to accommodate higher exhaust gas temperatures may influence the overall design of the gas turbine cycle, including the choice of intercooling, reheat, or regenerative cycles to optimize performance and efficiency.
