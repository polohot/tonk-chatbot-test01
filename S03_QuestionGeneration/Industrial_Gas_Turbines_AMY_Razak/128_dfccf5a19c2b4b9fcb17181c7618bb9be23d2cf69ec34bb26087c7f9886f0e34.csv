# 8 Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

It was stated in Chapter 7 that the change in ambient conditions and power demand from design conditions results in performance of the gas turbine deviating from its design point. In this chapter the concepts of component matching, discussed in the previous chapter, will be used to predict some of the behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation. Some assumptions will be made as this will simplify the explanation of the behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation.

# 8.1 Steady-state running line

Chapter 7 discussed the prediction of the off-design performance of various gas turbine configurations. Using these techniques, it is possible to determine the operating point for each non-dimensional speed line on the compressor characteristic. Joining these points will result in the steady-state running line on the compressor characteristic.

# 8.1.1 Single-shaft gas turbine

As stated, single-shaft gas turbines are used extensively in power generation; the gas turbine speed will be constant and will normally correspond to the generator speed. For a given ambient condition, this results in the running line aligning with a particular non-dimensional speed line. Before the generator can be loaded, the gas turbine speed is increased along the generator no-load line until it reaches the generator synchronous speed. Figure 8.1 shows this running line on the compressor characteristic. The effect of the change in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in the running line moving to another non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 8.1. With lower ambient temperature, the non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, will increase and conversely, the higher the ambient temperature, the lower will be the non-dimensional speed. Consequently, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow increases with

Although the analysis of the off-design performance of a gas turbine is quite tedious, much useful insight may be obtained by considering a simplified analysis of the flow, work and speed compatibility equations.

Referring to Fig. 8.2 and ignoring the gas properties terms R and γ, as changes in these values are smaller compared with the changes in mass flows, pressures and temperatures, the flow compatibility equation may be written as discussed in Saravanamutto et al.1 as:

W₃ T₃ W T P P T W

P₃ = 1P 1 × P1 × P2 × T³ × W³ [8.1]

1 2 3 1 1

If we assume that the turbine remains choked, particularly at high power, then W₃√T₃/P₃ will remain constant with turbine pressure ratio. If we also assume that the compressor speed line is near choke conditions, especially at high operating speeds, the variation of the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ with pressure ratio will be small. Furthermore, if the combustion pressure loss and bleeds are also assumed constant, then P₂/P₃ and W₃/W₁ will also be constant. Hence, an increase in compressor pressure ratio must be accompanied by an increase in T₃/T₁ to satisfy the flow compatibility in Equation 8.1.

Figure 8.3 shows a compressor characteristic, where the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise is plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. It can be seen that the non-dimensional temperature

The temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed is approximately constant, particularly at low-pressure ratios. This is due to the fall in compressor efficiency as the operating point moves away from the design point. Therefore, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and inlet temperature, the temperature rise ΔT₂₁ = T₂ – T₁ will be approximately constant, as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.1

The work compatibility equation gives us the net power output, pₙₑₜ:

pₙₑₜ = W₃ × cpg × (T₃ – T₄) – W₁ × cpa × (T₂ – T₁) [8.2]

where cpa and cpg are the mean specific heats at constant pressure during compression and expansion respectively and g is the mean isentropic expansion index.

Unlike the compressor, the turbine efficiency does not vary very much with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. Therefore, as the turbine pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature, T₃, increase, there is an increase in turbine power output. Since the compressor power absorbed W₁ × cpₐ × (T₂ – T₁) is approximately constant, there is an increase in the gas turbine power output pₙₑₜ. Thus, a series of running lines can be produced on the compressor characteristic, due to the increase in power and ambient temperature, T₁, as illustrated in Fig. 8.4.

In fact, the detailed analysis in determining the off-design performance of a gas turbine essentially solves these equations using detailed component characteristics. It also allows for the change in the thermodynamic properties of air and products of combustion due to temperature changes.

# 8.1.2 Two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine

To predict the running line for a two-shaft gas turbine, it is necessary to consider the performance behaviour of turbines operating in series. Figure 8.5 shows the characteristics of two turbines operating in series. For example, the HP turbine and the LP turbine would represent the gas generator (GG) turbine and power turbine respectively when applied to a two-shaft gas turbine.

The GG turbine inlet non-dimensional flow increases initially with turbine pressure ratio until the GG turbine chokes, after which the inlet non-dimensional flow remains constant. However, the GG turbine outlet non-dimensional flow increases continuously with turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 8.5. The power turbine inlet flow also increases with pressure ratio until it also chokes. The GG turbine exit flow must be ‘swallowed’ by the power turbine. Thus, the power turbine controls the GG turbine exit non-dimensional flow, and hence controls the GG turbine pressure ratio. The operating points 1, 2 and 3 in Fig. ","What is the effect of ambient temperature changes on the non-dimensional speed of a single-shaft gas turbine according to the book 'Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation' by Wheatly, P.O., Addison-Wesley?","Lower ambient temperature increases the non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, while higher ambient temperature decreases it.","The non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, varies inversely with ambient temperature: it rises as temperature falls and drops as temperature rises.","Ambient temperature changes affect the non-dimensional speed directly; a decrease in temperature leads to an increase in N₁/√T₁, and an increase in temperature leads to a decrease.","For a single-shaft gas turbine, the non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁ increases with lower ambient temperatures and decreases with higher ones, as detailed in the text.",The text explains that the non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁ is higher in colder conditions and lower in warmer conditions for single-shaft gas turbines.

# 8 Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

It was stated in Chapter 7 that the change in ambient conditions and power demand from design conditions results in performance of the gas turbine deviating from its design point. In this chapter the concepts of component matching, discussed in the previous chapter, will be used to predict some of the behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation. Some assumptions will be made as this will simplify the explanation of the behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation.

# 8.1 Steady-state running line

Chapter 7 discussed the prediction of the off-design performance of various gas turbine configurations. Using these techniques, it is possible to determine the operating point for each non-dimensional speed line on the compressor characteristic. Joining these points will result in the steady-state running line on the compressor characteristic.

# 8.1.1 Single-shaft gas turbine

As stated, single-shaft gas turbines are used extensively in power generation; the gas turbine speed will be constant and will normally correspond to the generator speed. For a given ambient condition, this results in the running line aligning with a particular non-dimensional speed line. Before the generator can be loaded, the gas turbine speed is increased along the generator no-load line until it reaches the generator synchronous speed. Figure 8.1 shows this running line on the compressor characteristic. The effect of the change in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in the running line moving to another non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 8.1. With lower ambient temperature, the non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, will increase and conversely, the higher the ambient temperature, the lower will be the non-dimensional speed. Consequently, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow increases with

decreasing ambient temperature and decreases with increase in ambient temperature.

Although the analysis of the off-design performance of a gas turbine is quite tedious, much useful insight may be obtained by considering a simplified analysis of the flow, work and speed compatibility equations.

Referring to Fig. 8.2 and ignoring the gas properties terms R and γ, as changes in these values are smaller compared with the changes in mass flows, pressures and temperatures, the flow compatibility equation may be written as discussed in Saravanamutto et al.1 as:

W₃ T₃ W T P P T W

P₃ = 1P 1 × P1 × P2 × T³ × W³ [8.1]

1 2 3 1 1

If we assume that the turbine remains choked, particularly at high power, then W₃√T₃/P₃ will remain constant with turbine pressure ratio. If we also assume that the compressor speed line is near choke conditions, especially at high operating speeds, the variation of the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ with pressure ratio will be small. Furthermore, if the combustion pressure loss and bleeds are also assumed constant, then P₂/P₃ and W₃/W₁ will also be constant. Hence, an increase in compressor pressure ratio must be accompanied by an increase in T₃/T₁ to satisfy the flow compatibility in Equation 8.1.

Figure 8.3 shows a compressor characteristic, where the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise is plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. It can be seen that the non-dimensional temperature

The temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed is approximately constant, particularly at low-pressure ratios. This is due to the fall in compressor efficiency as the operating point moves away from the design point. Therefore, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and inlet temperature, the temperature rise ΔT₂₁ = T₂ – T₁ will be approximately constant, as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.1

The work compatibility equation gives us the net power output, pₙₑₜ:

pₙₑₜ = W₃ × cpg × (T₃ – T₄) – W₁ × cpa × (T₂ – T₁) [8.2]

where cpa and cpg are the mean specific heats at constant pressure during compression and expansion respectively and g is the mean isentropic expansion index.

Unlike the compressor, the turbine efficiency does not vary very much with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. Therefore, as the turbine pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature, T₃, increase, there is an increase in turbine power output. Since the compressor power absorbed W₁ × cpₐ × (T₂ – T₁) is approximately constant, there is an increase in the gas turbine power output pₙₑₜ. Thus, a series of running lines can be produced on the compressor characteristic, due to the increase in power and ambient temperature, T₁, as illustrated in Fig. 8.4.

In fact, the detailed analysis in determining the off-design performance of a gas turbine essentially solves these equations using detailed component characteristics. It also allows for the change in the thermodynamic properties of air and products of combustion due to temperature changes.

To predict the running line for a two-shaft gas turbine, it is necessary to consider the performance behaviour of turbines operating in series. Figure 8.5 shows the characteristics of two turbines operating in series. For example, the HP turbine and the LP turbine would represent the gas generator (GG) turbine and power turbine respectively when applied to a two-shaft gas turbine.

The GG turbine inlet non-dimensional flow increases initially with turbine pressure ratio until the GG turbine chokes, after which the inlet non-dimensional flow remains constant. However, the GG turbine outlet non-dimensional flow increases continuously with turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 8.5. The power turbine inlet flow also increases with pressure ratio until it also chokes. The GG turbine exit flow must be ‘swallowed’ by the power turbine. Thus, the power turbine controls the GG turbine exit non-dimensional flow, and hence controls the GG turbine pressure ratio. The operating points 1, 2 and 3 in Fig. ",How does the turbine efficiency vary with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed in gas turbines according to the book?,Turbine efficiency does not vary significantly with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.,"Unlike compressors, turbine efficiency remains relatively constant across changes in pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.",The text notes that turbine efficiency shows little variation with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.,"Turbine efficiency is largely unaffected by variations in pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed, as mentioned in the book.","The book states that turbine efficiency is stable, not varying much with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed."

# 8 Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

It was stated in Chapter 7 that the change in ambient conditions and power demand from design conditions results in performance of the gas turbine deviating from its design point. In this chapter the concepts of component matching, discussed in the previous chapter, will be used to predict some of the behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation. Some assumptions will be made as this will simplify the explanation of the behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation.

# 8.1 Steady-state running line

Chapter 7 discussed the prediction of the off-design performance of various gas turbine configurations. Using these techniques, it is possible to determine the operating point for each non-dimensional speed line on the compressor characteristic. Joining these points will result in the steady-state running line on the compressor characteristic.

# 8.1.1 Single-shaft gas turbine

As stated, single-shaft gas turbines are used extensively in power generation; the gas turbine speed will be constant and will normally correspond to the generator speed. For a given ambient condition, this results in the running line aligning with a particular non-dimensional speed line. Before the generator can be loaded, the gas turbine speed is increased along the generator no-load line until it reaches the generator synchronous speed. Figure 8.1 shows this running line on the compressor characteristic. The effect of the change in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in the running line moving to another non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 8.1. With lower ambient temperature, the non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, will increase and conversely, the higher the ambient temperature, the lower will be the non-dimensional speed. Consequently, the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow increases with

decreasing ambient temperature and decreases with increase in ambient temperature.

Although the analysis of the off-design performance of a gas turbine is quite tedious, much useful insight may be obtained by considering a simplified analysis of the flow, work and speed compatibility equations.

Referring to Fig. 8.2 and ignoring the gas properties terms R and γ, as changes in these values are smaller compared with the changes in mass flows, pressures and temperatures, the flow compatibility equation may be written as discussed in Saravanamutto et al.1 as:

W₃ T₃ W T P P T W

P₃ = 1P 1 × P1 × P2 × T³ × W³ [8.1]

1 2 3 1 1

If we assume that the turbine remains choked, particularly at high power, then W₃√T₃/P₃ will remain constant with turbine pressure ratio. If we also assume that the compressor speed line is near choke conditions, especially at high operating speeds, the variation of the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ with pressure ratio will be small. Furthermore, if the combustion pressure loss and bleeds are also assumed constant, then P₂/P₃ and W₃/W₁ will also be constant. Hence, an increase in compressor pressure ratio must be accompanied by an increase in T₃/T₁ to satisfy the flow compatibility in Equation 8.1.

Figure 8.3 shows a compressor characteristic, where the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise is plotted against the pressure ratio for a series of non-dimensional speeds. It can be seen that the non-dimensional temperature

The temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed is approximately constant, particularly at low-pressure ratios. This is due to the fall in compressor efficiency as the operating point moves away from the design point. Therefore, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and inlet temperature, the temperature rise ΔT₂₁ = T₂ – T₁ will be approximately constant, as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.1

The work compatibility equation gives us the net power output, pₙₑₜ:

pₙₑₜ = W₃ × cpg × (T₃ – T₄) – W₁ × cpa × (T₂ – T₁) [8.2]

where cpa and cpg are the mean specific heats at constant pressure during compression and expansion respectively and g is the mean isentropic expansion index.

Unlike the compressor, the turbine efficiency does not vary very much with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. Therefore, as the turbine pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature, T₃, increase, there is an increase in turbine power output. Since the compressor power absorbed W₁ × cpₐ × (T₂ – T₁) is approximately constant, there is an increase in the gas turbine power output pₙₑₜ. Thus, a series of running lines can be produced on the compressor characteristic, due to the increase in power and ambient temperature, T₁, as illustrated in Fig. 8.4.

In fact, the detailed analysis in determining the off-design performance of a gas turbine essentially solves these equations using detailed component characteristics. It also allows for the change in the thermodynamic properties of air and products of combustion due to temperature changes.

# 8.1.2 Two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine

To predict the running line for a two-shaft gas turbine, it is necessary to consider the performance behaviour of turbines operating in series. Figure 8.5 shows the characteristics of two turbines operating in series. For example, the HP turbine and the LP turbine would represent the gas generator (GG) turbine and power turbine respectively when applied to a two-shaft gas turbine.

The GG turbine inlet non-dimensional flow increases initially with turbine pressure ratio until the GG turbine chokes, after which the inlet non-dimensional flow remains constant. However, the GG turbine outlet non-dimensional flow increases continuously with turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 8.5. The power turbine inlet flow also increases with pressure ratio until it also chokes. The GG turbine exit flow must be ‘swallowed’ by the power turbine. Thus, the power turbine controls the GG turbine exit non-dimensional flow, and hence controls the GG turbine pressure ratio. The operating points 1, 2 and 3 in Fig. ",What does Figure 8.1 in 'Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation' illustrate about single-shaft gas turbines?,"Figure 8.1 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for a single-shaft gas turbine, including effects of ambient temperature changes.","It depicts the compressor characteristic's running line, highlighting how ambient temperature variations shift this line.","The figure illustrates the running line on the compressor chart, demonstrating ambient temperature's impact on its position.",Shown in the figure is the running line's movement on the compressor characteristic due to changes in ambient temperature.,The text references Figure 8.1 to show the running line's behavior on the compressor characteristic under varying ambient temperatures.
