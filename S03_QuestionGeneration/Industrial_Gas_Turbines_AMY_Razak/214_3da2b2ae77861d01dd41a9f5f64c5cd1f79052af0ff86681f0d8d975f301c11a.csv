Thus, the creep life usage of the gas generator turbine and power turbine increase as the ambient pressure falls, resulting in a reduction in the time between overhauls. At the start of the ambient pressure transient, the power turbine operating life is in excess of 300,000 hours; thus it is outside the scale of the trend shown in Fig. 12.14 and is set by the speeds and temperature that prevail at the start of this simulation.

During the ambient pressure transient, the compressor discharge pressure has been observed to decrease, although the compressor pressure ratio increases. It was also observed that the primary zone temperature increases. In this case the influence of the increase in primary zone temperature is greater than the resultant decrease in combustion pressure, thus increasing the NOx, as shown in Fig. 12.15, where the trends in emissions during this transient are illustrated. The emission of CO remains essentially constant and is due to the increase in primary zone temperature compensating for the decrease in combustion pressure during the production of CO.

The production of CO2 decreases and follows the fuel flow trend, thus showing a decrease in CO2 production during this ambient pressure transient due to the improved thermal efficiency. Hence, at low engine power outputs, low ambient pressures are very beneficial in reducing CO2 emissions; CO2 is considered a greenhouse gas and is thought to be responsible for global warming.
