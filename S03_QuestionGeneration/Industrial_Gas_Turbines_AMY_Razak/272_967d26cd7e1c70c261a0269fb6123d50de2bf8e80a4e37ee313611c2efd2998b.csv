It is observed that the EGT remains constant throughout the transient and this is due to the opening of the VIGV as the ambient pressure decreases to maintain the EGT in the set point. The increase in specific work results in the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. The increase in T₃ is smaller compared with the previous case, and this is due primarily to a small decrease in compressor flow rate during the transient caused by the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow, resulting from the opening of the VIGV. The increase in compressor pressure ratio also results in a small increase in the compressor discharge temperatures.
