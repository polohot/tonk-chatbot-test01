Both these factors increase the turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 19.3. The increase in creep life usage due to peak rating almost halves the time between turbine overhauls. Although there is a very useful increase in power output and thermal efficiency, peak rating is usually used sparingly to prevent high maintenance costs. It is normally used at high ambient temperatures, where the largest increase in power output occurs.

The higher turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratios result in an increase in the combustion pressure and temperature. These two factors increase the formation of NOₓ while decreasing CO emissions, as shown in Fig. 19.4.
