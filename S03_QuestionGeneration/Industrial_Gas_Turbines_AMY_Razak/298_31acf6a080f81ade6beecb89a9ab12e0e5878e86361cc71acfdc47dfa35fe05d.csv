# 19.4 Power augmentation at low ambient temperatures

The power output of the gas turbine has been observed to become power limited at ambient temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, and the EGT falls below the limiting value at lower ambient temperatures. Means to augment power at higher ambient temperature such as peak rating do not increase the

power output of the gas turbine in the low ambient conditions. In fact, in Section 19.2 it was shown that the augmentation of power at high ambient temperature by increasing the VIGV angle may result in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures.

Increasing the gas turbine maximum power limit will indeed increase the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures. This will increase the turbine entry temperature and thus increase the turbine creep life usage requiring increased frequency of engine overhauls resulting in higher maintenance costs. The resultant increase in the compressor pressure ratio due to component matching then decreases the surge margin and increases the risk of compressor surge during transients, but this rise is usually very small. There will also be an increase in the power developed by the turbine and thus an increase in the power transmitted through the shaft to the load, seals and bearings. Thus, any power augmentation at low ambient temperature may need these components to be strengthened to ensure that no mechanical failure occurs due to the increased level of power that is transmitted. The modifications needed to achieve satisfactory aero-thermodynamic performance of the gas turbine due to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures will now be discussed.

It has been stated that increasing the maximum power limit will increase the EGT resulting in increased turbine creep life usage. If a substantial amount of engine operating occurs at low ambient temperatures, the gas turbine power limit can be increased but the EGT limit decreased. In this case the reduced creep life usage at high ambient temperature, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, compensates for the increase turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures (flat rating in reverse). However, the power output of the gas turbine will be reduced at high ambient temperatures, but this will be of little consequence if the power demand from the generator is low under these operating conditions. Figure 19.18 shows the power output from the gas turbine when the EGT limit is reduced by 20 degrees, while the maximum power limit is raised to 47.5 MW. Thus the power output from the gas turbine has effectively been increased by about 6% without increasing the maintenance cost.

The increase in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio due to the higher power limit of the gas turbine will also increase the thermal efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and hence improving profit. The effects of increasing the power output at low ambient temperatures on thermal efficiency and compressor pressure ratio are shown in Figs 19.19 and 19.20, respectively.

The reduced power at high ambient temperature is about 5% (at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius) compared to the gain in power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperature (6%). Reducing the EGT limit further, by 10 degrees, will almost halve the usage of turbine blade.

Hence it could be argued that the EGT limit should be raised at high ambient temperature, whilst decreasing the maximum power limit to reduce the turbine blade creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. This would be more suitable if the power demand from the gas turbine is critical at high ambient temperatures (e.g. high air).

conditioning loads in the summer). This is effectively peak rating the engine, but the reduced maximum power limit would prevent increased overhaul frequencies, thus preventing increased maintenance costs due to engine operation at peak rating conditions (normal flat rating).

Due to the increase in gas turbine power limit, it is observed that the compressor pressure ratio has increased. If the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is considered to be too high, the turbine capacity may be increased. This will decrease the compressor pressure ratio and also reduce the creep life usage due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature will reduce the thermal efficiency.

The impact of the increased gas turbine power limit on turbine creep life usage is shown in Fig. 19.21. The increase in the turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures, due to the increase in the power limit, shows an increased usage of turbine blade creep life usage when the power output of the gas turbine limits its performance. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in the turbine blade creep life usage is due to the reduction in the EGT limit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the higher maximum power limit at low ambient temperatures, result in an increase in the emissions of NOx, while decreasing the emissions of CO. At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, the decreases in the compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the reduction in EGT limit results in a decrease in NOx emissions whilst increasing the CO emissions, as shown in Fig. 19.22.

19.22 Variation of NOₓ and CO emissions due to increased power limit and reduced EGT limit.

The changes in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature result in an increase in the thermal efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At high ambient temperatures, the thermal efficiency decreases due to the decrease in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature, as the EGT limit is decreased. Thus it is observed that the CO emissions index decreases at low ambient temperatures and increases at high ambient temperatures, as shown.

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft in Fig. 19.23. However, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis are lower at high ambient temperatures, compared with the case at low ambient temperatures. This is due to the change in the gas turbine power output being greater than the change in the thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power range, at low ambient temperatures, the increase in the gas turbine power limit will result in the opening of VIGV to maintain the EGT limit. However, the opening of the VIGV increases the compressor flow rate and thus the compressor pressure ratio in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This will also increase the turbine entry temperature slightly and hence the turbine blade creep life usage. If the EGT limit is now decreased, this will result in a further opening of the VIGV, thus increasing the air flow rate through the engine further. This increase in the air flow rate compensates for the reduction in power output due to the lower EGT limit. The opening of the VIGV will improve the compressor efficiency, therefore reducing the turbine entry temperature further. Thus, the turbine blade creep life usage could remain unchanged due to the increase in the maximum power limit of the gas turbine when operating at low ambient temperatures with active VIGV in the normal operating power range. The decrease in EGT limit will, of course, decrease the power output at high ambient temperatures. Since there is no compromise in the turbine blade creep life usage when augmenting the gas turbine power output at low ambient temperatures, the EGT limit can be increased to its design (base) value at high ambient temperatures, thus incurring no penalty in turbine blade creep life usage due.

to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures. When the gas turbine is used in a combined cycle, the decrease in the EGT limit will have a detrimental effect on the performance of the steam plant and needs to be considered when augmenting the power output of the gas turbine by such means at low ambient temperatures.

An alternative is to increase the turbine capacity so that the compressor pressure ratio will decrease, thus resulting in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, in order to maintain turbine blade creep life. A significant increase in the turbine capacity may be necessary to achieve a sufficient decrease in the turbine entry temperature, but this could seriously penalise the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures, which may be unacceptable in terms of power output and thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal power range and used in conjunction with dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems, the decrease in the EGT limit, or increased turbine capacity to augment the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures, will result in a decrease in combustion temperature. Thus, there is a limit to how much the combustion temperature may decrease because there would be an increase in CO and UHC, which must be avoided. As an extreme case, the decrease in the combustion temperature could result in the weak extinction limit being exceeded, thus leading to engine trips.

The reader is left to use the simulator to illustrate the augmentation of the power output at low ambient temperatures using both these methods and producing the figures similar to those shown in Figs 19.18 to 19.23.

# 19.5 Turbine inlet cooling

In Section 19.3, power augmentation using direct water injection was discussed. An alternative means of water injection to augment the power output of gas turbines is to use it in turbine inlet cooling. In Chapter 14 Section 14.5, turbine inlet cooling applied to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine was discussed. Here, water can be evaporated in the inlet of the engine and the absorption of latent heat required for the evaporation process results in a decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. This results in an increase in power output and improved thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Another means of turbine inlet cooling is the use of chillers (mechanical and absorption types), as also discussed in Section 14.5. These technologies are applicable equally to a single-shaft gas turbine and the benefits are similar to those discussed in Section 14.5; the figures produced in Section 14.5 can be determined for a single-shaft gas turbine. ",What effect does direct water injection into the combustor have on the compressor pressure ratio?,"Direct water injection into the combustor increases the compressor pressure ratio, moving the operating point towards the compressor surge line.","The compressor pressure ratio is increased by direct water injection, as illustrated in Fig. 19.17, with a slight movement towards the surge line.","Injecting water directly into the combustor leads to a higher compressor pressure ratio, though the shift towards the surge line is minimal.","An increase in compressor pressure ratio is observed with direct water injection, affecting the gas turbine's operating point near the surge line.","Direct water injection results in a slight increase in the compressor pressure ratio, potentially impacting the gas turbine's performance near the surge line."

# 19.4 Power augmentation at low ambient temperatures

The power output of the gas turbine has been observed to become power limited at ambient temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, and the EGT falls below the limiting value at lower ambient temperatures. Means to augment power at higher ambient temperature such as peak rating do not increase the

power output of the gas turbine in the low ambient conditions. In fact, in Section 19.2 it was shown that the augmentation of power at high ambient temperature by increasing the VIGV angle may result in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures.

Increasing the gas turbine maximum power limit will indeed increase the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures. This will increase the turbine entry temperature and thus increase the turbine creep life usage requiring increased frequency of engine overhauls resulting in higher maintenance costs. The resultant increase in the compressor pressure ratio due to component matching then decreases the surge margin and increases the risk of compressor surge during transients, but this rise is usually very small. There will also be an increase in the power developed by the turbine and thus an increase in the power transmitted through the shaft to the load, seals and bearings. Thus, any power augmentation at low ambient temperature may need these components to be strengthened to ensure that no mechanical failure occurs due to the increased level of power that is transmitted. The modifications needed to achieve satisfactory aero-thermodynamic performance of the gas turbine due to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures will now be discussed.

It has been stated that increasing the maximum power limit will increase the EGT resulting in increased turbine creep life usage. If a substantial amount of engine operating occurs at low ambient temperatures, the gas turbine power limit can be increased but the EGT limit decreased. In this case the reduced creep life usage at high ambient temperature, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, compensates for the increase turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures (flat rating in reverse). However, the power output of the gas turbine will be reduced at high ambient temperatures, but this will be of little consequence if the power demand from the generator is low under these operating conditions. Figure 19.18 shows the power output from the gas turbine when the EGT limit is reduced by 20 degrees, while the maximum power limit is raised to 47.5 MW. Thus the power output from the gas turbine has effectively been increased by about 6% without increasing the maintenance cost.

The increase in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio due to the higher power limit of the gas turbine will also increase the thermal efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and hence improving profit. The effects of increasing the power output at low ambient temperatures on thermal efficiency and compressor pressure ratio are shown in Figs 19.19 and 19.20, respectively.

The reduced power at high ambient temperature is about 5% (at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius) compared to the gain in power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperature (6%). Reducing the EGT limit further, by 10 degrees, will almost halve the usage of turbine blade.

Hence it could be argued that the EGT limit should be raised at high ambient temperature, whilst decreasing the maximum power limit to reduce the turbine blade creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. This would be more suitable if the power demand from the gas turbine is critical at high ambient temperatures (e.g. high air).

conditioning loads in the summer). This is effectively peak rating the engine, but the reduced maximum power limit would prevent increased overhaul frequencies, thus preventing increased maintenance costs due to engine operation at peak rating conditions (normal flat rating).

Due to the increase in gas turbine power limit, it is observed that the compressor pressure ratio has increased. If the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is considered to be too high, the turbine capacity may be increased. This will decrease the compressor pressure ratio and also reduce the creep life usage due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature will reduce the thermal efficiency.

The impact of the increased gas turbine power limit on turbine creep life usage is shown in Fig. 19.21. The increase in the turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures, due to the increase in the power limit, shows an increased usage of turbine blade creep life usage when the power output of the gas turbine limits its performance. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in the turbine blade creep life usage is due to the reduction in the EGT limit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the higher maximum power limit at low ambient temperatures, result in an increase in the emissions of NOx, while decreasing the emissions of CO. At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, the decreases in the compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the reduction in EGT limit results in a decrease in NOx emissions whilst increasing the CO emissions, as shown in Fig. 19.22.

19.22 Variation of NOₓ and CO emissions due to increased power limit and reduced EGT limit.

The changes in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature result in an increase in the thermal efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At high ambient temperatures, the thermal efficiency decreases due to the decrease in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature, as the EGT limit is decreased. Thus it is observed that the CO emissions index decreases at low ambient temperatures and increases at high ambient temperatures, as shown.

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft in Fig. 19.23. However, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis are lower at high ambient temperatures, compared with the case at low ambient temperatures. This is due to the change in the gas turbine power output being greater than the change in the thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power range, at low ambient temperatures, the increase in the gas turbine power limit will result in the opening of VIGV to maintain the EGT limit. However, the opening of the VIGV increases the compressor flow rate and thus the compressor pressure ratio in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This will also increase the turbine entry temperature slightly and hence the turbine blade creep life usage. If the EGT limit is now decreased, this will result in a further opening of the VIGV, thus increasing the air flow rate through the engine further. This increase in the air flow rate compensates for the reduction in power output due to the lower EGT limit. The opening of the VIGV will improve the compressor efficiency, therefore reducing the turbine entry temperature further. Thus, the turbine blade creep life usage could remain unchanged due to the increase in the maximum power limit of the gas turbine when operating at low ambient temperatures with active VIGV in the normal operating power range. The decrease in EGT limit will, of course, decrease the power output at high ambient temperatures. Since there is no compromise in the turbine blade creep life usage when augmenting the gas turbine power output at low ambient temperatures, the EGT limit can be increased to its design (base) value at high ambient temperatures, thus incurring no penalty in turbine blade creep life usage due.

to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures. When the gas turbine is used in a combined cycle, the decrease in the EGT limit will have a detrimental effect on the performance of the steam plant and needs to be considered when augmenting the power output of the gas turbine by such means at low ambient temperatures.

An alternative is to increase the turbine capacity so that the compressor pressure ratio will decrease, thus resulting in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, in order to maintain turbine blade creep life. A significant increase in the turbine capacity may be necessary to achieve a sufficient decrease in the turbine entry temperature, but this could seriously penalise the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures, which may be unacceptable in terms of power output and thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal power range and used in conjunction with dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems, the decrease in the EGT limit, or increased turbine capacity to augment the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures, will result in a decrease in combustion temperature. Thus, there is a limit to how much the combustion temperature may decrease because there would be an increase in CO and UHC, which must be avoided. As an extreme case, the decrease in the combustion temperature could result in the weak extinction limit being exceeded, thus leading to engine trips.

The reader is left to use the simulator to illustrate the augmentation of the power output at low ambient temperatures using both these methods and producing the figures similar to those shown in Figs 19.18 to 19.23.

# 19.5 Turbine inlet cooling

In Section 19.3, power augmentation using direct water injection was discussed. An alternative means of water injection to augment the power output of gas turbines is to use it in turbine inlet cooling. In Chapter 14 Section 14.5, turbine inlet cooling applied to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine was discussed. Here, water can be evaporated in the inlet of the engine and the absorption of latent heat required for the evaporation process results in a decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. This results in an increase in power output and improved thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Another means of turbine inlet cooling is the use of chillers (mechanical and absorption types), as also discussed in Section 14.5. These technologies are applicable equally to a single-shaft gas turbine and the benefits are similar to those discussed in Section 14.5; the figures produced in Section 14.5 can be determined for a single-shaft gas turbine.

# 19.4 Power augmentation at low ambient temperatures

The power output of the gas turbine has been observed to become power limited at ambient temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, and the EGT falls below the limiting value at lower ambient temperatures. Means to augment power at higher ambient temperature such as peak rating do not increase the

power output of the gas turbine in the low ambient conditions. In fact, in Section 19.2 it was shown that the augmentation of power at high ambient temperature by increasing the VIGV angle may result in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures.

Increasing the gas turbine maximum power limit will indeed increase the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures. This will increase the turbine entry temperature and thus increase the turbine creep life usage requiring increased frequency of engine overhauls resulting in higher maintenance costs. The resultant increase in the compressor pressure ratio due to component matching then decreases the surge margin and increases the risk of compressor surge during transients, but this rise is usually very small. There will also be an increase in the power developed by the turbine and thus an increase in the power transmitted through the shaft to the load, seals and bearings. Thus, any power augmentation at low ambient temperature may need these components to be strengthened to ensure that no mechanical failure occurs due to the increased level of power that is transmitted. The modifications needed to achieve satisfactory aero-thermodynamic performance of the gas turbine due to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures will now be discussed.

It has been stated that increasing the maximum power limit will increase the EGT resulting in increased turbine creep life usage. If a substantial amount of engine operating occurs at low ambient temperatures, the gas turbine power limit can be increased but the EGT limit decreased. In this case the reduced creep life usage at high ambient temperature, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, compensates for the increase turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures (flat rating in reverse). However, the power output of the gas turbine will be reduced at high ambient temperatures, but this will be of little consequence if the power demand from the generator is low under these operating conditions. Figure 19.18 shows the power output from the gas turbine when the EGT limit is reduced by 20 degrees, while the maximum power limit is raised to 47.5 MW. Thus the power output from the gas turbine has effectively been increased by about 6% without increasing the maintenance cost.

The increase in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio due to the higher power limit of the gas turbine will also increase the thermal efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and hence improving profit. The effects of increasing the power output at low ambient temperatures on thermal efficiency and compressor pressure ratio are shown in Figs 19.19 and 19.20, respectively.

The reduced power at high ambient temperature is about 5% (at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius) compared to the gain in power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperature (6%). Reducing the EGT limit further, by 10 degrees, will almost halve the usage of turbine blade.

Hence it could be argued that the EGT limit should be raised at high ambient temperature, whilst decreasing the maximum power limit to reduce the turbine blade creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. This would be more suitable if the power demand from the gas turbine is critical at high ambient temperatures (e.g. high air).

conditioning loads in the summer). This is effectively peak rating the engine, but the reduced maximum power limit would prevent increased overhaul frequencies, thus preventing increased maintenance costs due to engine operation at peak rating conditions (normal flat rating).

Due to the increase in gas turbine power limit, it is observed that the compressor pressure ratio has increased. If the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is considered to be too high, the turbine capacity may be increased. This will decrease the compressor pressure ratio and also reduce the creep life usage due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature will reduce the thermal efficiency.

The impact of the increased gas turbine power limit on turbine creep life usage is shown in Fig. 19.21. The increase in the turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures, due to the increase in the power limit, shows an increased usage of turbine blade creep life usage when the power output of the gas turbine limits its performance. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in the turbine blade creep life usage is due to the reduction in the EGT limit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the higher maximum power limit at low ambient temperatures, result in an increase in the emissions of NOx, while decreasing the emissions of CO. At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, the decreases in the compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the reduction in EGT limit results in a decrease in NOx emissions whilst increasing the CO emissions, as shown in Fig. 19.22.

19.22 Variation of NOₓ and CO emissions due to increased power limit and reduced EGT limit.

The changes in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature result in an increase in the thermal efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At high ambient temperatures, the thermal efficiency decreases due to the decrease in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature, as the EGT limit is decreased. Thus it is observed that the CO emissions index decreases at low ambient temperatures and increases at high ambient temperatures, as shown.

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft in Fig. 19.23. However, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis are lower at high ambient temperatures, compared with the case at low ambient temperatures. This is due to the change in the gas turbine power output being greater than the change in the thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power range, at low ambient temperatures, the increase in the gas turbine power limit will result in the opening of VIGV to maintain the EGT limit. However, the opening of the VIGV increases the compressor flow rate and thus the compressor pressure ratio in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This will also increase the turbine entry temperature slightly and hence the turbine blade creep life usage. If the EGT limit is now decreased, this will result in a further opening of the VIGV, thus increasing the air flow rate through the engine further. This increase in the air flow rate compensates for the reduction in power output due to the lower EGT limit. The opening of the VIGV will improve the compressor efficiency, therefore reducing the turbine entry temperature further. Thus, the turbine blade creep life usage could remain unchanged due to the increase in the maximum power limit of the gas turbine when operating at low ambient temperatures with active VIGV in the normal operating power range. The decrease in EGT limit will, of course, decrease the power output at high ambient temperatures. Since there is no compromise in the turbine blade creep life usage when augmenting the gas turbine power output at low ambient temperatures, the EGT limit can be increased to its design (base) value at high ambient temperatures, thus incurring no penalty in turbine blade creep life usage due.

to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures. When the gas turbine is used in a combined cycle, the decrease in the EGT limit will have a detrimental effect on the performance of the steam plant and needs to be considered when augmenting the power output of the gas turbine by such means at low ambient temperatures.

An alternative is to increase the turbine capacity so that the compressor pressure ratio will decrease, thus resulting in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, in order to maintain turbine blade creep life. A significant increase in the turbine capacity may be necessary to achieve a sufficient decrease in the turbine entry temperature, but this could seriously penalise the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures, which may be unacceptable in terms of power output and thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal power range and used in conjunction with dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems, the decrease in the EGT limit, or increased turbine capacity to augment the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures, will result in a decrease in combustion temperature. Thus, there is a limit to how much the combustion temperature may decrease because there would be an increase in CO and UHC, which must be avoided. As an extreme case, the decrease in the combustion temperature could result in the weak extinction limit being exceeded, thus leading to engine trips.

The reader is left to use the simulator to illustrate the augmentation of the power output at low ambient temperatures using both these methods and producing the figures similar to those shown in Figs 19.18 to 19.23.

# 19.5 Turbine inlet cooling

In Section 19.3, power augmentation using direct water injection was discussed. An alternative means of water injection to augment the power output of gas turbines is to use it in turbine inlet cooling. In Chapter 14 Section 14.5, turbine inlet cooling applied to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine was discussed. Here, water can be evaporated in the inlet of the engine and the absorption of latent heat required for the evaporation process results in a decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. This results in an increase in power output and improved thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Another means of turbine inlet cooling is the use of chillers (mechanical and absorption types), as also discussed in Section 14.5. These technologies are applicable equally to a single-shaft gas turbine and the benefits are similar to those discussed in Section 14.5; the figures produced in Section 14.5 can be determined for a single-shaft gas turbine.

power output of the gas turbine in the low ambient conditions. In fact, in Section 19.2 it was shown that the augmentation of power at high ambient temperature by increasing the VIGV angle may result in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures.

Increasing the gas turbine maximum power limit will indeed increase the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures. This will increase the turbine entry temperature and thus increase the turbine creep life usage requiring increased frequency of engine overhauls resulting in higher maintenance costs. The resultant increase in the compressor pressure ratio due to component matching then decreases the surge margin and increases the risk of compressor surge during transients, but this rise is usually very small. There will also be an increase in the power developed by the turbine and thus an increase in the power transmitted through the shaft to the load, seals and bearings. Thus, any power augmentation at low ambient temperature may need these components to be strengthened to ensure that no mechanical failure occurs due to the increased level of power that is transmitted. The modifications needed to achieve satisfactory aero-thermodynamic performance of the gas turbine due to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures will now be discussed.

It has been stated that increasing the maximum power limit will increase the EGT resulting in increased turbine creep life usage. If a substantial amount of engine operating occurs at low ambient temperatures, the gas turbine power limit can be increased but the EGT limit decreased. In this case the reduced creep life usage at high ambient temperature, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, compensates for the increase turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures (flat rating in reverse). However, the power output of the gas turbine will be reduced at high ambient temperatures, but this will be of little consequence if the power demand from the generator is low under these operating conditions. Figure 19.18 shows the power output from the gas turbine when the EGT limit is reduced by 20 degrees, while the maximum power limit is raised to 47.5 MW. Thus the power output from the gas turbine has effectively been increased by about 6% without increasing the maintenance cost.

The increase in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio due to the higher power limit of the gas turbine will also increase the thermal efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and hence improving profit. The effects of increasing the power output at low ambient temperatures on thermal efficiency and compressor pressure ratio are shown in Figs 19.19 and 19.20, respectively.

The reduced power at high ambient temperature is about 5% (at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius) compared to the gain in power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperature (6%). Reducing the EGT limit further, by 10 degrees, will almost halve the usage of turbine blade.

Creep life at high ambient temperatures. Hence it could be argued that the EGT limit should be raised at high ambient temperature, whilst decreasing the maximum power limit to reduce the turbine blade creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. This would be more suitable if the power demand from the gas turbine is critical at high ambient temperatures (e.g. high air).

conditioning loads in the summer). This is effectively peak rating the engine, but the reduced maximum power limit would prevent increased overhaul frequencies, thus preventing increased maintenance costs due to engine operation at peak rating conditions (normal flat rating).

Due to the increase in gas turbine power limit, it is observed that the compressor pressure ratio has increased. If the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is considered to be too high, the turbine capacity may be increased. This will decrease the compressor pressure ratio and also reduce the creep life usage due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature will reduce the thermal efficiency.

The impact of the increased gas turbine power limit on turbine creep life usage is shown in Fig. 19.21. The increase in the turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures, due to the increase in the power limit, shows an increased usage of turbine blade creep life usage when the power output of the gas turbine limits its performance. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in the turbine blade creep life usage is due to the reduction in the EGT limit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the higher maximum power limit at low ambient temperatures, result in an increase in the emissions of NOx, while decreasing the emissions of CO. At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, the decreases in the compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the reduction in EGT limit results in a decrease in NOx emissions whilst increasing the CO emissions, as shown in Fig. 19.22.

19.22 Variation of NOₓ and CO emissions due to increased power limit and reduced EGT limit.

The changes in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature result in an increase in the thermal efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At high ambient temperatures, the thermal efficiency decreases due to the decrease in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature, as the EGT limit is decreased. Thus it is observed that the CO emissions index decreases at low ambient temperatures and increases at high ambient temperatures, as shown.

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft in Fig. 19.23. However, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis are lower at high ambient temperatures, compared with the case at low ambient temperatures. This is due to the change in the gas turbine power output being greater than the change in the thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power range, at low ambient temperatures, the increase in the gas turbine power limit will result in the opening of VIGV to maintain the EGT limit. However, the opening of the VIGV increases the compressor flow rate and thus the compressor pressure ratio in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This will also increase the turbine entry temperature slightly and hence the turbine blade creep life usage. If the EGT limit is now decreased, this will result in a further opening of the VIGV, thus increasing the air flow rate through the engine further. This increase in the air flow rate compensates for the reduction in power output due to the lower EGT limit. The opening of the VIGV will improve the compressor efficiency, therefore reducing the turbine entry temperature further. Thus, the turbine blade creep life usage could remain unchanged due to the increase in the maximum power limit of the gas turbine when operating at low ambient temperatures with active VIGV in the normal operating power range. The decrease in EGT limit will, of course, decrease the power output at high ambient temperatures. Since there is no compromise in the turbine blade creep life usage when augmenting the gas turbine power output at low ambient temperatures, the EGT limit can be increased to its design (base) value at high ambient temperatures, thus incurring no penalty in turbine blade creep life usage due.

to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures. When the gas turbine is used in a combined cycle, the decrease in the EGT limit will have a detrimental effect on the performance of the steam plant and needs to be considered when augmenting the power output of the gas turbine by such means at low ambient temperatures.

An alternative is to increase the turbine capacity so that the compressor pressure ratio will decrease, thus resulting in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, in order to maintain turbine blade creep life. A significant increase in the turbine capacity may be necessary to achieve a sufficient decrease in the turbine entry temperature, but this could seriously penalise the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures, which may be unacceptable in terms of power output and thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal power range and used in conjunction with dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems, the decrease in the EGT limit, or increased turbine capacity to augment the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures, will result in a decrease in combustion temperature. Thus, there is a limit to how much the combustion temperature may decrease because there would be an increase in CO and UHC, which must be avoided. As an extreme case, the decrease in the combustion temperature could result in the weak extinction limit being exceeded, thus leading to engine trips.

The reader is left to use the simulator to illustrate the augmentation of the power output at low ambient temperatures using both these methods and producing the figures similar to those shown in Figs 19.18 to 19.23.

# 19.5 Turbine inlet cooling

In Section 19.3, power augmentation using direct water injection was discussed. An alternative means of water injection to augment the power output of gas turbines is to use it in turbine inlet cooling. In Chapter 14 Section 14.5, turbine inlet cooling applied to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine was discussed. Here, water can be evaporated in the inlet of the engine and the absorption of latent heat required for the evaporation process results in a decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. This results in an increase in power output and improved thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Another means of turbine inlet cooling is the use of chillers (mechanical and absorption types), as also discussed in Section 14.5. These technologies are applicable equally to a single-shaft gas turbine and the benefits are similar to those discussed in Section 14.5; the figures produced in Section 14.5 can be determined for a single-shaft gas turbine.

Thus, any power augmentation at low ambient temperature may need these components to be strengthened to ensure that no mechanical failure occurs due to the increased level of power that is transmitted. The modifications needed to achieve satisfactory aero-thermodynamic performance of the gas turbine due to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures will now be discussed.

It has been stated that increasing the maximum power limit will increase the EGT resulting in increased turbine creep life usage. If a substantial amount of engine operating occurs at low ambient temperatures, the gas turbine power limit can be increased but the EGT limit decreased. In this case the reduced creep life usage at high ambient temperature, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, compensates for the increase turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures (flat rating in reverse). However, the power output of the gas turbine will be reduced at high ambient temperatures, but this will be of little consequence if the power demand from the generator is low under these operating conditions. Figure 19.18 shows the power output from the gas turbine when the EGT limit is reduced by 20 degrees, while the maximum power limit is raised to 47.5 MW. Thus the power output from the gas turbine has effectively been increased by about 6% without increasing the maintenance cost.

The increase in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio due to the higher power limit of the gas turbine will also increase the thermal efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and hence improving profit. The effects of increasing the power output at low ambient temperatures on thermal efficiency and compressor pressure ratio are shown in Figs 19.19 and 19.20, respectively.

The reduced power at high ambient temperature is about 5% (at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius) compared to the gain in power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperature (6%). Reducing the EGT limit further, by 10 degrees, will almost halve the usage of turbine blade.

Creep life at high ambient temperatures. Hence it could be argued that the EGT limit should be raised at high ambient temperature, whilst decreasing the maximum power limit to reduce the turbine blade creep life usage at low ambient temperatures. This would be more suitable if the power demand from the gas turbine is critical at high ambient temperatures (e.g. high air).

conditioning loads in the summer). This is effectively peak rating the engine, but the reduced maximum power limit would prevent increased overhaul frequencies, thus preventing increased maintenance costs due to engine operation at peak rating conditions (normal flat rating).

Due to the increase in gas turbine power limit, it is observed that the compressor pressure ratio has increased. If the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is considered to be too high, the turbine capacity may be increased. This will decrease the compressor pressure ratio and also reduce the creep life usage due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature will reduce the thermal efficiency.

The impact of the increased gas turbine power limit on turbine creep life usage is shown in Fig. 19.21. The increase in the turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures, due to the increase in the power limit, shows an increased usage of turbine blade creep life usage when the power output of the gas turbine limits its performance. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in the turbine blade creep life usage is due to the reduction in the EGT limit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the higher maximum power limit at low ambient temperatures, result in an increase in the emissions of NOx, while decreasing the emissions of CO. At high ambient temperatures, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, the decreases in the compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature due to the reduction in EGT limit results in a decrease in NOx emissions whilst increasing the CO emissions, as shown in Fig. 19.22.

19.22 Variation of NOₓ and CO emissions due to increased power limit and reduced EGT limit.

The changes in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature result in an increase in the thermal efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At high ambient temperatures, the thermal efficiency decreases due to the decrease in the compressor ratio and turbine entry temperature, as the EGT limit is decreased. Thus it is observed that the CO emissions index decreases at low ambient temperatures and increases at high ambient temperatures, as shown.

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft in Fig. 19.23. However, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis are lower at high ambient temperatures, compared with the case at low ambient temperatures. This is due to the change in the gas turbine power output being greater than the change in the thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power range, at low ambient temperatures, the increase in the gas turbine power limit will result in the opening of VIGV to maintain the EGT limit. However, the opening of the VIGV increases the compressor flow rate and thus the compressor pressure ratio in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This will also increase the turbine entry temperature slightly and hence the turbine blade creep life usage. If the EGT limit is now decreased, this will result in a further opening of the VIGV, thus increasing the air flow rate through the engine further. This increase in the air flow rate compensates for the reduction in power output due to the lower EGT limit. The opening of the VIGV will improve the compressor efficiency, therefore reducing the turbine entry temperature further. Thus, the turbine blade creep life usage could remain unchanged due to the increase in the maximum power limit of the gas turbine when operating at low ambient temperatures with active VIGV in the normal operating power range. The decrease in EGT limit will, of course, decrease the power output at high ambient temperatures. Since there is no compromise in the turbine blade creep life usage when augmenting the gas turbine power output at low ambient temperatures, the EGT limit can be increased to its design (base) value at high ambient temperatures, thus incurring no penalty in turbine blade creep life usage due.

# Power augmentation

to power augmentation at low ambient temperatures. When the gas turbine is used in a combined cycle, the decrease in the EGT limit will have a detrimental effect on the performance of the steam plant and needs to be considered when augmenting the power output of the gas turbine by such means at low ambient temperatures.

An alternative is to increase the turbine capacity so that the compressor pressure ratio will decrease, thus resulting in a decrease in turbine entry temperature, in order to maintain turbine blade creep life. A significant increase in the turbine capacity may be necessary to achieve a sufficient decrease in the turbine entry temperature, but this could seriously penalise the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures, which may be unacceptable in terms of power output and thermal efficiency.

When the VIGV is active in the normal power range and used in conjunction with dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems, the decrease in the EGT limit, or increased turbine capacity to augment the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures, will result in a decrease in combustion temperature. Thus, there is a limit to how much the combustion temperature may decrease because there would be an increase in CO and UHC, which must be avoided. As an extreme case, the decrease in the combustion temperature could result in the weak extinction limit being exceeded, thus leading to engine trips.

The reader is left to use the simulator to illustrate the augmentation of the power output at low ambient temperatures using both these methods and producing the figures similar to those shown in Figs 19.18 to 19.23.

# 19.5 Turbine inlet cooling

In Section 19.3, power augmentation using direct water injection was discussed. An alternative means of water injection to augment the power output of gas turbines is to use it in turbine inlet cooling. In Chapter 14 Section 14.5, turbine inlet cooling applied to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine was discussed. Here, water can be evaporated in the inlet of the engine and the absorption of latent heat required for the evaporation process results in a decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. This results in an increase in power output and improved thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Another means of turbine inlet cooling is the use of chillers (mechanical and absorption types), as also discussed in Section 14.5. These technologies are applicable equally to a single-shaft gas turbine and the benefits are similar to those discussed in Section 14.5; the figures produced in Section 14.5 can be determined for a single-shaft gas turbine.

This movement is only small and should not present any problems with respect to the transient performance of the gas turbine and may only be an issue at low ambient temperatures when the gas turbine is power limited.

power output of the gas turbine in the low ambient conditions. In fact, in Section 19.2 it was shown that the augmentation of power at high ambient temperature by increasing the VIGV angle may result in a decrease in power output from the gas turbine at lower ambient temperatures.

Increasing the gas turbine maximum power limit will indeed increase the power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperatures. This will increase the turbine entry temperature and thus increase the turbine creep life usage requiring increased frequency of engine overhauls resulting in higher maintenance costs. The resultant increase in the compressor pressure ratio due to component matching then decreases the surge margin and increases the risk of compressor surge during transients, but this rise is usually very small. There will also be an increase in the power developed by the turbine and thus an increase in the power transmitted through the shaft to the load, seals and bearings. Thus, any power augmentation at low ambient temperature may need these components to be strengthened to ensure that no mechanical failure occurs due to the increased level of power that is transmitted.

If a substantial amount of engine operating occurs at low ambient temperatures, the gas turbine power limit can be increased but the EGT limit decreased. In this case the reduced creep life usage at high ambient temperature, when the engine power output is limited by the EGT, compensates for the increase turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures (flat rating in reverse). However, the power output of the gas turbine will be reduced at high ambient temperatures, but this will be of little consequence if the power demand from the generator is low under these operating conditions. Figure 19.18 shows the power output from the gas turbine when the EGT limit is reduced by 20 degrees, while the maximum power limit is raised to 47.5 MW. Thus the power output from the gas turbine has effectively been increased by about 6% without increasing the maintenance cost.

The increase in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio due to the higher power limit of the gas turbine will also increase the thermal efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and hence improving profit. The effects of increasing the power output at low ambient temperatures on thermal efficiency and compressor pressure ratio are shown in Figs 19.19 and 19.20, respectively.

The reduced power at high ambient temperature is about 5% (at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius) compared to the gain in power output from the gas turbine at low ambient temperature (6%). Reducing the EGT limit further, by 10 degrees, will almost halve the usage of turbine blade.
