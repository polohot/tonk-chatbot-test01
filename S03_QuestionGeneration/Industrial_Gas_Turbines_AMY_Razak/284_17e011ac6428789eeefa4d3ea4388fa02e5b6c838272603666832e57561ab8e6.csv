# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

# 18.4.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase. To determine the true picture of the impact of hot end damage on these emissions, it is necessary to run the simulator at the reduced power available due to this performance deterioration, but when no hot end damage is present. It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

The reduction in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO₂ emission on a mass basis but, due to the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, an

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What causes the air–fuel ratio to increase during the simulation of hot end damage?,The air–fuel ratio increases due to a decrease in fuel flow while the combustion air flow remains constant.,"An increase in the air–fuel ratio is observed because the fuel flow decreases, and the air flow does not change significantly.","During the simulation, the fuel flow drops, leading to a higher air–fuel ratio as the air flow stays the same.",The ratio of air to fuel goes up when the simulation shows reduced fuel flow with steady air flow.,"Fuel flow reduction, with combustion air flow unchanged, results in an increased air–fuel ratio."

18.33 Turbine creep life usage due to hot end damage and operating at high power.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation?,"Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV increases EGT to maintain power demand, raising turbine entry temperature.","With active VIGV, hot end damage at low power elevates EGT, increasing turbine entry temperature but decreasing compressor pressure ratio.","Active VIGV operation during hot end damage at low power results in higher EGT and turbine entry temperature, with a lower compressor pressure ratio.","At low power, hot end damage with active VIGV leads to increased EGT and turbine entry temperature, reducing compressor pressure ratio.","The effect includes higher EGT and turbine entry temperature, with a drop in compressor pressure ratio, when VIGV is active at low power with hot end damage."

# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase.

It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

18.33 Turbine creep life usage due to hot end damage and operating at high power.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What are the observed trends in turbine creep life usage due to hot end damage?,Turbine creep life usage decreases due to lower blade temperature and stress from hot end damage.,Hot end damage reduces creep life usage by decreasing turbine blade temperature and stress.,Lower blade temperature and stress from hot end damage lead to decreased creep life usage.,Creep life usage trends downward as hot end damage lowers turbine blade temperature and stress.,The reduction in blade temperature and stress due to hot end damage causes a decrease in creep life usage.
