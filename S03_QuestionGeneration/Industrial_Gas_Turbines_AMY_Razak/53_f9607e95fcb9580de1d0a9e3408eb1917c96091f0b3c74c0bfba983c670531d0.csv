W = RT₁ ln (Prₒ)                                               [3.26]

where T is the temperature at the start of compression and expansion, Prₒ is the pressure ratio of the compression and expansion processes and R is the gas constant of the fluid being compressed or expanded, which is usually air.

From the steady flow energy equation:

Q – W = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

For an ideal isothermal process, T₂ = T₁. ",What is the significance of the gas constant (R) in the specific work equation for isothermal processes in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,The gas constant (R) is vital as it links the physical properties of the gas to the work done during isothermal compression or expansion.,"In the equation W = RT₁ ln (Prₒ), R represents the gas constant, crucial for calculating the specific work based on the gas's characteristics.","The book emphasizes R's role in determining the specific work, as it varies with the gas used in the compression or expansion process.","R's inclusion in the specific work formula accounts for the type of gas, influencing the work calculation in isothermal conditions.","According to the book, the gas constant R is a key factor in the specific work equation, reflecting the gas's properties in isothermal processes."
