# 11.14 Variation of power output and thermal efficiency with ambient temperature.

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",What does Figure 11.12 indicate about gas turbine performance at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius?,"Figure 11.12 indicates that gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius.","At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by N₁/√T₁, as shown in Figure 11.12.","The constraint on gas turbine performance below –12 degrees Celsius is due to the compressor non-dimensional speed, according to Figure 11.12.","Figure 11.12 shows that below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine's operation is restricted by the compressor's non-dimensional speed.","Gas turbine performance at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius is limited by N₁/√T₁, as depicted in Figure 11.12."

The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",How does the operating point on the compressor characteristic change with ambient temperature?,"The operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts with ambient temperature, remaining at the –30 degrees Celsius case below certain temperatures.","Changes in ambient temperature alter the compressor characteristic's operating point, stabilizing at the –30 degrees Celsius scenario under specific conditions.","Below certain ambient temperatures, the compressor characteristic's operating point is fixed at the –30 degrees Celsius case, as described.",The compressor's operating point adjusts with ambient temperature but settles at the –30 degrees Celsius point when temperatures drop sufficiently.,"Ambient temperature variations cause the compressor characteristic's operating point to change, eventually matching the –30 degrees Celsius condition at lower temperatures."

# 11.14 Variation of power output and thermal efficiency with ambient temperature.

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",What role does the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio play in gas turbine performance?,"The maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio plays a crucial role in determining gas turbine performance, especially in relation to power output and efficiency.","Gas turbine performance is significantly influenced by the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, impacting both power and efficiency.","A key factor in gas turbine performance, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio affects operational outcomes like power output.","The ratio between maximum and minimum cycle temperatures is vital for gas turbine performance, dictating changes in power and efficiency.","Performance metrics of gas turbines, including power output, are directly affected by the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio."
