# 1.2.2 Two-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine

The expansion process in the turbine shown in Fig. 1.1 above may be split into two separate turbines. The first is used to drive the compressor and the second is used to drive the load. The mechanically independent (free) turbine driving the load is called the power turbine. The remaining turbine or high-pressure turbine, compressor and the combustor are called the gas generator. Figure 1.2 shows a schematic layout of a two-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine and is probably the most common engine configuration that is employed for gas turbines in general.

The function of the gas generator is to produce high pressure and high temperature gases for the power turbine. Two-shaft gas turbines operating with a power turbine are often used to drive loads where there is a significant variation in the speed with power demand (mechanical drive applications such as gas compression). Examples are pipeline compressors and pumps. The process conditions may be such that the load runs at low speed but absorbs or demands a large amount of power. In such a situation, the power turbine can run at the speed of the load and the gas generator can run at its maximum speed. If a single shaft gas turbine were employed to provide the power requirements for such applications, the whole engine would be constrained to run at the speed of the load thus resulting in poor engine performance due to the low operating speed condition.

Two-shaft gas turbines are also employed in industrial power generation with the power turbine designed to operate at a fixed speed determined by the generator. Unlike a single-shaft engine, the gas generator speed will vary with electrical load. The main advantage is smaller starting power requirements, as the gas generator only needs to be turned during starting, and better off-design performance. The disadvantage is that the shedding of the electrical load can result in over-speeding of the power turbine.

# 1.2.3 Three-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine

The gas generator (GG), as discussed in Section 1.2.2, can be divided further to produce a two-shaft or a twin spool gas generator. When this is done, the high-pressure GG turbine drives the high-pressure GG compressor, and the low pressure GG turbine drives the low pressure GG compressor. However, there is no mechanical linkage between the high pressure and low pressure shafts in the gas generator. Figure 1.3 shows a schematic layout of a three-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine. The power turbine is still mechanically independent from the gas generator as described in Section 1.2.2.

Such three-shaft arrangements, as with a two-shaft gas turbine with its own power turbine, are widely used in mechanical drive applications. Much higher-pressure ratios and thermal efficiencies may be achieved with such a layout without having to resort to variable geometry compressors as would be required by two-shaft gas engines when designed to operate at high compressor pressure ratios.

Three-shaft gas turbines also have the added advantage of lower starting powers because only the high-pressure compressor and turbine in the gas generator need to be turned during starting. Engines that use such a configuration are often derived from aircraft gas turbines and are referred to as aero-derivatives.

As seen in the power turbine configurations described in Sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, the power turbine can over-speed if the electrical load is shed when driving a generator. The two-shaft gas turbine overcomes this problem and still requires smaller starting powers than the single shaft gas turbine. The configuration is very similar to that of a three-shaft gas turbine but the power turbine is now an integral part of the LP turbine and drives both the LP turbine and the HP turbine.

However, starting power requirements are low because we only need to turn the HP spool during the starting of the gas turbine. Figure 1.4 shows a schematic layout of a two-shaft gas turbine.

One of the weaknesses of a gas turbine is its poor performance when operating at low powers. This is due to the reduction in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratios when operating at low power outputs, resulting in poor thermal efficiencies. The effect of turbine entry temperature and pressure ratio on engine performance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.

Unlike the open cycle gas turbine discussed previously, the closed cycle gas turbine is a self-contained system in which the system pressure is varied to alter the power output from the gas turbine. Thus, it is possible to operate a closed cycle gas turbine at constant turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio, thereby maintaining good thermal efficiency at low powers.

Essentially, the mass flow rate through the engine is reduced by reducing the working pressure due to the opening of the blow-off valve as shown in Fig. 1.5, which is a schematic representation of a closed cycle gas turbine.

Single-shaft gas turbines have the advantage of preventing over-speed conditions due to the high power required by the compressor and can act as an effective brake should the loss of electrical load occur.

# 1.2.2 Two-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine

The expansion process in the turbine shown in Fig. 1.1 above may be split into two separate turbines. The first is used to drive the compressor and the second is used to drive the load. The mechanically independent (free) turbine driving the load is called the power turbine. The remaining turbine or high-pressure turbine, compressor and the combustor are called the gas generator. Figure 1.2 shows a schematic layout of a two-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine and is probably the most common engine configuration that is employed for gas turbines in general.

The function of the gas generator is to produce high pressure and high temperature gases for the power turbine. Two-shaft gas turbines operating with a power turbine are often used to drive loads where there is a significant variation in the speed with power demand (mechanical drive applications such as gas compression). Examples are pipeline compressors and pumps. The process conditions may be such that the load runs at low speed but absorbs or demands a large amount of power. In such a situation, the power turbine can run at the speed of the load and the gas generator can run at its maximum speed. If a single shaft gas turbine were employed to provide the power requirements for such applications, the whole engine would be constrained to run at the speed of the load thus resulting in poor engine performance due to the low operating speed condition.

Two-shaft gas turbines are also employed in industrial power generation with the power turbine designed to operate at a fixed speed determined by the generator. Unlike a single-shaft engine, the gas generator speed will vary with electrical load. The main advantage is smaller starting power requirements, as the gas generator only needs to be turned during starting, and better off-design performance. The disadvantage is that the shedding of the electrical load can result in over-speeding of the power turbine.

# 1.2.3 Three-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine

The gas generator (GG), as discussed in Section 1.2.2, can be divided further to produce a two-shaft or a twin spool gas generator. When this is done, the high-pressure GG turbine drives the high-pressure GG compressor, and the low pressure GG turbine drives the low pressure GG compressor. However, there is no mechanical linkage between the high pressure and low pressure shafts in the gas generator. Figure 1.3 shows a schematic layout of a three-shaft gas turbine with a power turbine. The power turbine is still mechanically independent from the gas generator as described in Section 1.2.2.

Such three-shaft arrangements, as with a two-shaft gas turbine with its own power turbine, are widely used in mechanical drive applications. Much higher-pressure ratios and thermal efficiencies may be achieved with such a layout without having to resort to variable geometry compressors as would be required by two-shaft gas engines when designed to operate at high compressor pressure ratios.

Three-shaft gas turbines also have the added advantage of lower starting powers because only the high-pressure compressor and turbine in the gas generator need to be turned during starting. Engines that use such a configuration are often derived from aircraft gas turbines and are referred to as aero-derivatives.

# 1.2.4 Two-shaft gas turbine

As seen in the power turbine configurations described in Sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, the power turbine can over-speed if the electrical load is shed when driving a generator. The two-shaft gas turbine overcomes this problem and still requires smaller starting powers than the single shaft gas turbine. The configuration is very similar to that of a three-shaft gas turbine but the power turbine is now an integral part of the LP turbine and drives both the LP turbine and the HP turbine.

However, starting power requirements are low because we only need to turn the HP spool during the starting of the gas turbine. Figure 1.4 shows a schematic layout of a two-shaft gas turbine.

One of the weaknesses of a gas turbine is its poor performance when operating at low powers. This is due to the reduction in the turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratios when operating at low power outputs, resulting in poor thermal efficiencies. The effect of turbine entry temperature and pressure ratio on engine performance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.

Unlike the open cycle gas turbine discussed previously, the closed cycle gas turbine is a self-contained system in which the system pressure is varied to alter the power output from the gas turbine. Thus, it is possible to operate a closed cycle gas turbine at constant turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio, thereby maintaining good thermal efficiency at low powers.

Essentially, the mass flow rate through the engine is reduced by reducing the working pressure due to the opening of the blow-off valve as shown in Fig. 1.5, which is a schematic representation of a closed cycle gas turbine.
