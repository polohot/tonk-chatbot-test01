Combustion can be initiated by injecting fuel into the eye of the vortex, where the air velocity will be below the flame velocity, resulting in sufficient time for the heat released to sustain combustion. The vortices formed by the bluff bodies will eventually break down into turbulence represented by smaller vortices. This increase in the level of turbulence will increase the rate of fuel being burnt, hence increasing the heat release rate, and will therefore enable smaller combustion volumes to be used for a given heat release rate.

In gas turbine combustion systems, air is introduced through the primary and secondary holes. These flows form a forced vortex and can increase the level of turbulence in the primary zone, resulting in better flame stabilisation and heat release rate.
