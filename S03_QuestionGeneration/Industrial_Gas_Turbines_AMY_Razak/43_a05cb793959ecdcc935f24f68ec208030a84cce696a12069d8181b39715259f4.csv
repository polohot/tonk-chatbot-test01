The case for the non-intercooled regenerative cycle is also shown for comparative purposes. In the ideal case the heat input, Q₅₆ = cₚ(T₆ – T₅), for the intercooled regenerative cycle (1–2–3–4–5–6–7–8) is no different to that of the non-intercooled regenerative cycle (1–4 ′–5–6–7–7′).

However, the specific work output from the intercooled cycle is greater, as discussed in Section 3.1. Thus the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle will be greater. For a given heat input, the thermal efficiency will be a maximum when the specific work is a maximum and will correspond to the case when the compressor work absorbed is a minimum. It was shown in Section 3.1 that the work absorbed by the intercooled compressors will be a minimum when the pressure ratios of the LP and HP compressors are equal. Thus, in the ideal case, the temperatures T₄, T₂ and T₈ shown in Fig. 3.11 will be equal.

A relatively simple expression may be derived for the optimised ideal thermal efficiency, ηₜₕ, for an intercooled regenerative cycle as follows:

It was shown for the maximum thermal efficiency case that the compressor work is a minimum and equals 2cₚ(T₂ – T₁). This occurs at equal LP and HP.

However, the specific work output from the intercooled cycle is greater, as discussed in Section 3.1. Thus the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle will be greater. For a given heat input, the thermal efficiency will be a maximum when the specific work is a maximum and will correspond to the case when the compressor work absorbed is a minimum. It was shown in Section 3.1 that the work absorbed by the intercooled compressors will be a minimum when the pressure ratios of the LP and HP compressors are equal. Thus, in the ideal case, the temperatures T₄, T₂ and T₈ shown in Fig. 3.11 will be equal.

A relatively simple expression may be derived for the optimised ideal thermal efficiency, ηₜₕ, for an intercooled regenerative cycle as follows:

The case for the non-intercooled regenerative cycle is also shown for comparative purposes. In the ideal case the heat input, Q₅₆ = cₚ(T₆ – T₅), for the intercooled regenerative cycle (1–2–3–4–5–6–7–8) is no different to that of the non-intercooled regenerative cycle (1–4 ′–5–6–7–7′).

However, the specific work output from the intercooled cycle is greater, as discussed in Section 3.1. Thus the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle will be greater. For a given heat input, the thermal efficiency will be a maximum when the specific work is a maximum and will correspond to the case when the compressor work absorbed is a minimum. It was shown in Section 3.1 that the work absorbed by the intercooled compressors will be a minimum when the pressure ratios of the LP and HP compressors are equal. Thus, in the ideal case, the temperatures T₄, T₂ and T₈ shown in Fig. 3.11 will be equal.

A relatively simple expression may be derived for the optimised ideal thermal efficiency, ηₜₕ, for an intercooled regenerative cycle as follows:

It was shown for the maximum thermal efficiency case that the compressor work is a minimum and equals 2cₚ(T₂ – T₁). This occurs at equal LP and HP.

ηₜₕ = 1 - (T₅ - T₆) / (T₂ - T₁) [3.5]

Equation 3.8 is identical to Equation 2.25, which describes the thermal efficiency for a simple cycle employing regeneration, except for the factor ⌈ 2 ⌉. Since c + 1 > 2 for c > 1, the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than that of the simple regenerative cycle. When c = 1, the thermal efficiencies of both regenerative cycles are

the same and equal to the Carnot efficiency. By differentiating c with respect to c, it can be shown that the thermal efficiency of an intercooled regenerative cycle decreases with increase in pressure ratio P₄/P₁ or P₆/P₇. From Equation 3.8, the thermal efficiency increases as T₁/T₅ decreases. These conclusions are similar to that of the regenerative cycle discussed in Section 2.7.

Figure 3.12 illustrates the variation of the thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for the regenerative cycles. For comparison, the figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for the simple and intercooled cycles. The point where the curves for the regenerative cycles meet the simple and intercooled cycles corresponds to the condition that the turbine exit temperature equals the compressor discharge temperature. The pressure ratio for this condition is greater for the intercooled cycle.
