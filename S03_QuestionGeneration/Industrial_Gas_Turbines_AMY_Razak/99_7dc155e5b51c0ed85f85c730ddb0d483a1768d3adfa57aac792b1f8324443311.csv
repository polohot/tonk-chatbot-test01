# 6.18.1 NOx correlations

Many correlations have been developed and validated by various research programmes and some of these parametric models for predicting NOₓ will now be discussed. The first correlation is due to Lefebvre, who suggests that NOₓ is given by:

NOₓ = 9 × 10–8 P1.25 Vc exp(0.01Tst)Tpz/ma [6.14]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume (m3)
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel. The correlation has been developed for conventional spray combustors only. It is also claimed to work for lean pre-mixed vaporiser combustors provided that the primary zone temperature, Tpz, which will be the maximum temperature attained during combustion, is substituted for Tst.

Odgers and Kretschmer also developed a correlation for predicting NOₓ based on aero-engines, and this is given by:

NOₓ = 28exp – (21670/Tc)P0.66 [1 – exp – (250 τ)] [6.15]

where

- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- P is combustion pressure in atmospheres
- τ is the residence time in seconds.

They recommend that the time constant for air blast atomisers is set to 0.8 ms and for pressure swirl atomisers τ is set to 1.0 ms. NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.
