Integrating Equation 2.44, which describes the variation of specific heat with temperature for air and products of combustion, equations for enthalpy and entropy can be developed. Therefore:

H = a T (T2  – T02) [1 / (T – T0) + b / 2 – c (T – T0)]

where T and P are the temperature and pressure of air or gas, respectively, and T₀ and P₀ are the reference temperature and pressure when the enthalpy and entropy, respectively, are assumed to be zero, when the temperature and pressure are 273 K and 1.013 Bar-A, respectively.

The constants a, b and c are determined as follows:

ai, bi and ci are the constants defined in Table 2.1 for each component and noc are the number of components in air or products of combustion.

In the example, the compressor inlet pressure and temperature is 1.013 Bar and 288 K. From Equations 2.65 and 2.66 we calculate the enthalpy and entropy at the compressor inlet as:

H₁ = 14.876 kJ/kg

S₁ = 0.053 kJ/kg K.

For a compressor pressure ratio of 20, the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ = 20.26 Bar-A. From Equation 2.66 the isentropic compressor discharge temperature can be determined. This is achieved by using P₂ for the pressure term in Equation 2.66 and varying the temperature until the entropy equals 0.053 kJ/kg K. The isentropic compressor discharge temperature, T2′, works out to:

T2′ = 659.452 K.

Using this value in Equation 2.65, the enthalpy at compressor discharge, H2′ due to isentropic compression is obtained:

H2′ = 402.286 kJ/kg

The isentropic efficiency Equation 2.28 for a compression process can be written in terms of enthalpies as:

ηc = H²′ – H¹ where H is the actual enthalpy at the discharge of the compressor which corresponds to:

H₂ = 460.175 kJ/kg

# 56 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Using the value for H₂ in Equation 2.65, the actual compressor discharge temperature, T₂, can be determined implicitly:

T₂ = 713.102 K

The compressor-specific work: Wc = H₂ – H₁. Therefore:

Wc = 445.3 kJ/kg

The fuel–air ratio may now be computed similarly to that discussed in Method 2. The combustor inlet temperature and combustor temperature rise for this case are 702.86 K and 697.14 K, respectively. A theoretical fuel–air ratio, f, of 0.0195 is obtained. The actual fuel–air ratio, fₐ = 0.0195/0.99 = 0.0197.

Since the turbine entry temperature, T₃, pressure, P₃, and the combustion gas composition are now known, Equations 2.65 and 2.66 can be used to determine the enthalpy, H₃ and entropy, S₃ at turbine entry. The enthalpy at the exit due to isentropic expansion must be determined. This is achieved by using Equation 2.66 and varying the turbine exit temperature, T₄, until the entropy equals the value determined at the inlet of the turbine, S₃. From

Equation 2.65 the enthalpy, H4′ at turbine exit due to isentropic expansion can be determined. The turbine isentropic efficiency in Equation 2.30 can be represented as:

ηt = (H3 – H4) / (H3 – H4′)

where H4 is the actual enthalpy at turbine exit.

The values for H3, S3 and H4′ are 1272.995 kJ/kg, 0.958 kJ/kg K and 428.005 kJ/kg, respectively. For a turbine isentropic efficiency of 0.9, the actual enthalpy at exit from the turbine is 512.504 kJ/kg and the entropy at turbine exit is 1.0768 kJ/kg K. Thus the turbine specific work, Wt, is:

Wt = H3 – H4 = 1272.995 – 512.504 = 760.491 kJ/kg

The net specific work (Wnₑₜ) from the gas turbine is:

Since the turbine entry temperature, T₃, pressure, P₃, and the combustion gas composition are now known, Equations 2.65 and 2.66 can be used to determine the enthalpy, H₃ and entropy, S₃ at turbine entry. The enthalpy at the exit due to isentropic expansion must be determined. This is achieved by using Equation 2.66 and varying the turbine exit temperature, T₄, until the entropy equals the value determined at the inlet of the turbine, S₃. From

Equation 2.65 the enthalpy, H4′ at turbine exit due to isentropic expansion can be determined. The turbine isentropic efficiency in Equation 2.30 can be represented as:

ηt = (H3 – H4) / (H3 – H4′)

where H4 is the actual enthalpy at turbine exit.

The values for H3, S3 and H4′ are 1272.995 kJ/kg, 0.958 kJ/kg K and 428.005 kJ/kg, respectively. For a turbine isentropic efficiency of 0.9, the actual enthalpy at exit from the turbine is 512.504 kJ/kg and the entropy at turbine exit is 1.0768 kJ/kg K. Thus the turbine specific work, Wt, is:

Wt = H3 – H4 = 1272.995 – 512.504 = 760.491 kJ/kg

The net specific work (Wnₑₜ) from the gas turbine is:

Integrating Equation 2.44, which describes the variation of specific heat with temperature for air and products of combustion, equations for enthalpy and entropy can be developed. Therefore:

In the example, the compressor inlet pressure and temperature is 1.013 Bar and 288 K. From Equations 2.65 and 2.66 we calculate the enthalpy and entropy at the compressor inlet as:

H₁ = 14.876 kJ/kg

S₁ = 0.053 kJ/kg K.

For a compressor pressure ratio of 20, the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ = 20.26 Bar-A. From Equation 2.66 the isentropic compressor discharge temperature can be determined. This is achieved by using P₂ for the pressure term in Equation 2.66 and varying the temperature until the entropy equals 0.053 kJ/kg K. The isentropic compressor discharge temperature, T2′, works out to:

T2′ = 659.452 K.

Using this value in Equation 2.65, the enthalpy at compressor discharge, H2′ due to isentropic compression is obtained:

H2′ = 402.286 kJ/kg

The isentropic efficiency Equation 2.28 for a compression process can be written in terms of enthalpies as:

ηc = H²′ – H¹ where H is the actual enthalpy at the discharge of the compressor which corresponds to:

H₂ = 460.175 kJ/kg

# 56 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Using the value for H₂ in Equation 2.65, the actual compressor discharge temperature, T₂, can be determined implicitly:

T₂ = 713.102 K

The compressor-specific work: Wc = H₂ – H₁. Therefore:

Wc = 445.3 kJ/kg

The fuel–air ratio may now be computed similarly to that discussed in Method 2. The combustor inlet temperature and combustor temperature rise for this case are 702.86 K and 697.14 K, respectively. A theoretical fuel–air ratio, f, of 0.0195 is obtained. The actual fuel–air ratio, fₐ = 0.0195/0.99 = 0.0197.
