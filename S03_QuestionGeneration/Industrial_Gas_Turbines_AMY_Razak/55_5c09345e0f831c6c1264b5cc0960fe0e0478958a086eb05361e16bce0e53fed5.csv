# 3.5 Combined cycle gas turbines

With ideal regenerative gas turbine cycles, the increase in thermal efficiency is achieved by transferring some of the heat rejected into the compressor discharge air via a heat exchanger, resulting in a reduction in the heat input. The power output remains essentially the same. In combined cycle gas turbines, we utilise the rejected heat to produce more power thus increasing the thermal efficiency of the whole power-producing system. The waste heat or exhaust heat from the gas turbine is passed through a waste heat recovery boiler (WHB) to raise high-pressure steam, which is used by a steam turbine to produce power. Since the increase in power output occurs without the input of additional heat, the overall thermal efficiency is increased.

A schematic presentation of a combined cycle gas turbine plant using a dual pressure boiler system is shown in Fig. 3.36. A dual pressure systems increase the average temperature of the steam, as shown in Fig. 3.37, which describes the temperature–enthalpy diagram of a combined cycle gas turbine. This approach increases the thermal efficiency of the steam cycle, thus converting more of the exhaust heat from the gas turbine into useful power. However, dual pressure systems reduce the amount of superheat and would.

Nonetheless, thermal efficiencies exceeding 60% are possible, as illustrated in Fig. 3.35. However, it should be noted that the thermal efficiency is more dependent on the maximum cycle temperature than on pressure ratio, particularly at high cycle pressure ratios and this is due to the ideal Ericsson cycle thermal efficiency being dependent on temperatures rather than on pressure ratios.

# 3.5 Combined cycle gas turbines

With ideal regenerative gas turbine cycles, the increase in thermal efficiency is achieved by transferring some of the heat rejected into the compressor discharge air via a heat exchanger, resulting in a reduction in the heat input. The power output remains essentially the same. In combined cycle gas turbines, we utilise the rejected heat to produce more power thus increasing the thermal efficiency of the whole power-producing system. The waste heat or exhaust heat from the gas turbine is passed through a waste heat recovery boiler (WHB) to raise high-pressure steam, which is used by a steam turbine to produce power. Since the increase in power output occurs without the input of additional heat, the overall thermal efficiency is increased.

A schematic presentation of a combined cycle gas turbine plant using a dual pressure boiler system is shown in Fig. 3.36. A dual pressure systems increase the average temperature of the steam, as shown in Fig. 3.37, which describes the temperature–enthalpy diagram of a combined cycle gas turbine. This approach increases the thermal efficiency of the steam cycle, thus converting more of the exhaust heat from the gas turbine into useful power. However, dual pressure systems reduce the amount of superheat and would.
