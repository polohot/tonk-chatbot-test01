1. **Pressure Losses**: Various pressure losses occur in components such as heat exchangers, compressors, and combustion chambers. For instance, heat exchanger pressure losses (both high pressure and low pressure) and combustion pressure losses can significantly impact overall efficiency.

2. **Cycle Temperature**: The thermal efficiency is more dependent on the maximum cycle temperature (T₃) than on the pressure ratio, especially at high cycle pressure ratios. This is because the ideal Ericsson cycle thermal efficiency is primarily dictated by temperature rather than pressure.

3. **Polytropic Efficiency**: The efficiency of the compressor also plays a role. For example, a compressor polytropic efficiency of 0.87 can affect the overall thermal efficiency.

4. **Number of Stages**: The number of compressor and turbine stages can influence the efficiency, as more stages can lead to better energy extraction and compression processes.

5. **Heat Recovery**: In combined cycle gas turbines, the effectiveness of waste heat recovery systems, such as waste heat recovery boilers (WHB), impacts the overall thermal efficiency. The ability to utilize rejected heat to produce additional power is crucial.

6. **Superheat and Dryness Fraction**: In dual pressure systems, while they increase the average temperature of the steam and improve thermal efficiency, they can also reduce the amount of superheat, leading to potential erosion problems in the low-pressure stages of the steam turbine.

These factors collectively contribute to the deviations from the ideal thermal efficiency in gas turbine operations."

Pinch points refer to the temperature differences between the hot and cold fluids in a heat exchanger at which the heat transfer is most limited. 

In a gas turbine cycle, especially in combined cycle systems, the efficiency can be significantly improved by optimizing the heat recovery process. The pinch point indicates the minimum temperature difference required for effective heat exchange. If the pinch point is too high, it means that the heat exchanger is not operating efficiently, leading to less heat being transferred from the exhaust gases to the working fluid (such as water in a steam cycle). This results in lower thermal efficiency because less energy is recovered from the exhaust heat, which could otherwise be used to generate additional power.

By minimizing the pinch point, engineers can enhance the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycle. This allows for more effective use of the waste heat, thereby increasing the overall power output without the need for additional fuel input.
