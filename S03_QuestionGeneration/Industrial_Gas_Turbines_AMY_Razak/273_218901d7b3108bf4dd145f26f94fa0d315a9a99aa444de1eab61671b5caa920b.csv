But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

# 17.3.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

# 18.1.8 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",How does the opening of the VIGV affect the compressor pressure ratio during a decrease in ambient pressure?,"The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, which in turn increases the compressor pressure ratio to satisfy flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.","During a decrease in ambient pressure, the VIGV opens, leading to an increase in compressor non-dimensional flow and thus an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18.","Opening the VIGV results in a higher compressor pressure ratio by increasing the compressor's non-dimensional flow, ensuring compatibility with the turbine's flow requirements.","The compressor pressure ratio rises when the VIGV opens due to the enhanced non-dimensional flow, despite the ambient pressure drop, maintaining system equilibrium.","An open VIGV boosts the compressor's non-dimensional flow, elevating the pressure ratio to align with the turbine's needs during ambient pressure reductions."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

17.23 Trends in VIGV position and compressor and turbine speed during ambient pressure transient.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

# 17.3.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",What impact does the decrease in ambient pressure have on compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure?,"The decrease in ambient pressure lowers the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure, though the effect is mitigated by the increased compressor pressure ratio from VIGV opening.","Despite the rise in compressor pressure ratio due to VIGV adjustment, the drop in ambient pressure is sufficient to reduce both compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures.","Lower ambient pressure decreases compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures, but the extent is lessened compared to scenarios without VIGV intervention.","The reduction in ambient pressure leads to decreased pressures at the compressor discharge and turbine inlet, as illustrated in Figs. 17.22 and 17.14.","Ambient pressure reduction causes a decline in compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures, partially offset by the compressor pressure ratio increase from VIGV opening."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

# 17.3.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

# 18.1.8 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",How does compressor fouling affect the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine?,"Compressor fouling reduces the compressor's flow capacity and efficiency, leading to decreased compressor and turbine pressure ratios, and ultimately lowering the gas turbine's power output and thermal efficiency.","In a single-shaft gas turbine, compressor fouling decreases non-dimensional flow and efficiency, shifting the operating point on the compressor characteristic and reducing overall performance.","Fouling impacts the single-shaft gas turbine by diminishing compressor efficiency and flow, resulting in lower pressure ratios and reduced power output, as detailed in Fig. 18.3.","The performance degradation from compressor fouling includes reduced compressor and turbine pressure ratios, leading to lower thermal efficiency and power output in single-shaft configurations.","Compressor fouling in single-shaft turbines leads to a leftward shift in the compressor characteristic, decreasing flow and pressure ratios, and adversely affecting power and efficiency."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

# 18.1.8 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",What are the trends in turbine creep life usage during compressor fouling?,"During compressor fouling, the turbine metal temperature decreases, which reduces the turbine creep life usage, indicating a longer time before the next overhaul is needed.","Compressor fouling leads to a decrease in turbine metal temperature, thereby reducing creep life usage and extending the turbine's operational lifespan.","The reduction in turbine metal temperature due to fouling decreases creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 18.9, suggesting less frequent overhauls.","Fouling-induced decreases in turbine metal temperature lower creep life usage, effectively increasing the time between necessary overhauls.","Turbine creep life usage diminishes during compressor fouling because of the lowered metal temperature, extending the interval until the next overhaul."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

The ambient temperature remains constant, the decrease in turbine pressure ratio also results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and thus the reduction in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

# 18.1.8 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",How do gas turbine emissions change during compressor fouling?,"Compressor fouling results in decreased NOx and increased CO emissions due to lower combustion pressures and temperatures, alongside reduced CO2 emissions on a mass flow basis.","During fouling, NOx emissions drop and CO emissions rise, with CO2 emissions decreasing in mass flow but increasing in emissions index due to lower thermal efficiency.","Fouling leads to lower NOx and higher CO emissions, with CO2 emissions on a mass basis decreasing, as depicted in Fig. 18.10.","The changes in emissions during fouling include reduced NOx, increased CO, and a decrease in CO2 mass flow emissions, impacted by the drop in combustion temperatures and pressures.","Compressor fouling affects emissions by decreasing NOx and increasing CO, while CO2 emissions on a mass basis fall, reflecting changes in combustion conditions."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

# 18.6 Trends in flow during compressor fouling.

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

# 18.1.8 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",What is the effect of compressor fouling on the air–fuel ratio in a single-shaft gas turbine?,Compressor fouling increases the air–fuel ratio due to the decrease in combustion air flow and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature.,"The air–fuel ratio rises during fouling because of reduced compressor air flow and stable combustor inlet temperatures, altering combustion dynamics.","Fouling elevates the air–fuel ratio, as the reduction in air flow and constant compressor discharge temperature shift the mixture towards more air per unit fuel.","An increase in the air–fuel ratio is observed during fouling, resulting from decreased air flow and unchanged compressor discharge temperatures.","The air–fuel ratio increases under fouling conditions due to lower air flow rates and consistent compressor discharge temperatures, affecting combustion efficiency."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",How does the VIGV position change during an ambient pressure transient?,"The VIGV opens from about 60% to 95% as the ambient pressure decreases, adjusting to maintain compressor performance.","During an ambient pressure drop, the VIGV position shifts from approximately 60% to 95% open, optimizing compressor flow and pressure ratios.","The VIGV opens significantly, from 60% to 95%, in response to decreasing ambient pressure, as illustrated in Fig. 17.23.","A decrease in ambient pressure causes the VIGV to open wider, ranging from 60% to 95%, to adapt to changing operational conditions.","The VIGV adjusts its opening from 60% to 95% during an ambient pressure transient, ensuring efficient compressor operation."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

# 17.3.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs.

It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",What are the consequences of compressor fouling on gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency?,Compressor fouling reduces both the gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency due to decreased compressor and turbine performance.,"The power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine decline during fouling, as the compressor's diminished flow and efficiency impair overall system performance.","Fouling leads to lower power output and thermal efficiency, as the compressor's reduced capability affects the turbine's operation and the system's energy conversion.","Decreases in power output and thermal efficiency are direct results of compressor fouling, impacting the gas turbine's operational effectiveness.","The adverse effects of fouling include reduced power output and thermal efficiency, stemming from compromised compressor and turbine functionalities."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",How does the compressor non-dimensional speed behave during an ambient pressure transient?,"The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during an ambient pressure transient, as the ambient temperature and gas turbine speed do not change.","During the transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed stays unchanged because the factors determining it—ambient temperature and turbine speed—remain stable.","The compressor non-dimensional speed is constant throughout the ambient pressure transient, unaffected by the changes in ambient pressure.",Stability in ambient temperature and gas turbine speed ensures the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during the pressure transient.,"No variation in compressor non-dimensional speed occurs during the transient, as both ambient temperature and turbine speed are unchanged."

But whether the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the turbine inlet pressure, decrease during the transient depends on the compressor characteristic changes due to the opening of the VIGV and to the decrease in ambient pressure. Since the change in the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, is small in this case, the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 17.18. This is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine (Equation 8.1). It is also observed that the increase in the compressor pressure ratio is greater compared with the previous case (Fig. 17.9), where the increase in compressor ratio resulted largely from the increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow is approximately constant in the previous case). However the pressure ratio in the previous case is affected only by the factor √T₃/T₁, thus the increase in pressure ratio in this case is greater. The decrease in the ambient pressure is sufficient to decrease the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure in spite of the increase in compressor pressure ratio, but the decrease in these pressures is smaller compared with the previous case (Section 7.2), as shown in Fig. 17.22 and 17.14, respectively.

# 17.3.4 Trends in VIGV position and speed

The opening of the VIGV due to the decrease in the ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 17.23. The VIGV opens from about 60% to about 95% as the ambient pressure decreases. The compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this transient because the ambient temperature and gas turbine.

# 17.3.5 Trends in flow

Although the compressor non-dimensional flow increases during the transient, the decrease in compressor inlet pressure results in a decrease in compressor flow as the ambient pressure reduces. This is shown in Fig. 17.24, which gives the trends in flow, fuel valve position and air–fuel ratio during the ambient pressure transient. It has been seen that the thermal efficiency increases and this is due to the increase in the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the fuel flow decreases during the transient. The fuel valve also closes due to the decrease in fuel flow. The small increases in the compressor discharge temperature and turbine entry temperature result in the air–fuel ratio remaining essentially constant. Thus the suitability of the use of a VIGV compressor in DLE engines is again observed where the air–fuel ratio can be maintained during a change in load.

# 17.3.6 Trends in creep life

It has been seen that the turbine entry temperature and the compressor discharge temperature (which is also the turbine cooling air temperature) increase only.

slightly. Therefore, there is only a slight increase in the turbine blade metal temperature. However, the turbine creep life usage is very sensitive to the turbine blade metal temperature and this increase results in higher turbine creep life usage, as shown in Fig. 17.25.

Although the creep life usage in the present case is greater compared with the previous case when the VIGV remained fully opened (Fig. 17.15), the

The combustion pressure and temperature changes are quite small during in this case. Thus the changes in NOx and CO emissions are also small as shown in Fig. 17.26. The increase in gas turbine thermal efficiency leads to a decrease in the fuel flow as the gas turbine power output remains constant during the decrease in ambient pressure. The decrease in fuel flow therefore reduces the CO2 emissions on a mass basis and the increase in the turbine thermal efficiency also results in the decrease in CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.26.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on engine performance

The effects of component performance deterioration on engine performance were discussed in Chapter 9 and these deteriorations applied to the two-shaft gas turbine. These deteriorations are now applied to investigate the impact of component performance deterioration on a single shaft gas turbine. The engine performance is deteriorated or degraded by applying fault indices as discussed when the two-shaft gas turbine was considered. However, there are only four fault indices, due to the absence of the power turbine in the single-shaft gas turbine. These indices correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively.

# 18.1 Compressor fouling (high-power operation)

As stated, compressor fouling is the most common form of performance deterioration and compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the flow capacity and efficiency of the compressor through the use of fault indices. Again, moderate compressor fouling is considered and this is simulated by setting the compressor fouling fault index and the compressor efficiency fault index to –3% and –1%, respectively, to change over 1 hour (3600 seconds) linearly. It is also assumed that the ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity remain constant during compressor fouling at 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The inlet and exhaust losses are assumed to be at 100 mm of water gauge. As the impact of compressor fouling at high power is to be investigated, the generator power demand is set at 60 MW. At the assumed ambient conditions, the engine will always remain on the EGT limit during the simulation.

# 18.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trend in fault indices is shown in Fig. 18.1 and the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices due to compressor fouling.

18.1 Trends in fault indices during compressor fouling are observed. These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine component remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 18.1.2 Compressor characteristic and pressure and temperature ratios

Since the ambient temperature, and hence the compressor inlet temperature, remain constant and the compressor speed does not change (determined by the frequency of the electrical generator), the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁, remains constant. Due to the shift in the compressor non-dimensional speed line during fouling, the operating point on the compressor characteristic shifts to the left. This is shown in Fig. 18.2, where the movement of the operating point is shown on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling. Thus compressor fouling will result in a decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow will also result in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 18.3. This is due to the effects of re-matching between the compressor and turbine due to compressor fouling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the turbine pressure ratio is influenced directly by the compressor pressure ratio, so a decrease is also observed in the turbine pressure ratio (Fig. 18.3). Since the operation is on an EGT limit and the

18.4 Trends in pressure during compressor fouling.

# 18.1.3 Trends in pressure and temperature

The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio. As the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during compressor fouling, the compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change much during compressor fouling. The trends in these pressures are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency during fouling, and the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, result in an approximately constant compressor discharge temperature, as shown in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature since the EGT remains constant on its operating limit. The reduction in the turbine entry temperature and the near-constant compressor discharge temperature also result in a small decrease in the turbine metal temperature, and this can be seen in Fig. 18.5. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling also reduces the combustor primary zone temperature.

# 18.1.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 18.6. The decrease in the compressor air flow rate is primarily due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature and constant compressor discharge temperature, and thus

Combustor inlet temperature, result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio. The decrease in the combustion air flow due to the decrease in the compressor air flow rate, and the increase in air–fuel ratio, result in a decrease in the fuel flow during compressor fouling. The fuel valve position also decreases to satisfy the reduction in fuel flow.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

# 18.1.5 Trends in power and efficiency

Since the compressor temperature rise remains essentially constant, the specific work absorbed by the compressor also remains constant. However, the reduction in the compressor mass flow rate through the compressor due to fouling results in a decrease in the power absorbed by the compressor and this is shown in Fig. 18.7, as is the decrease in the compressor efficiency. The turbine power output also decreases due to the decreases in the turbine pressure ratio, mass flow rate through the turbine and the turbine entry temperature. The small decrease in the turbine entry temperature does not affect the turbine efficiency and this is also shown in Fig. 18.7. The decrease in the above parameters also results in a decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, gas turbine power output and hence a reduction in the power output from the generator (Fig. 18.8).

Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed may increase, thereby increasing the air flow rate to partly compensate for the loss in power output due to compressor fouling, the fixed gas turbine speed of a single-shaft gas turbine generally has a more adverse effect on engine performance when compressor fouling occurs.

# 18.1.6 Trends in turbine creep life

The decrease in the turbine metal temperature as seen in Fig. 18.5 and the reduced power developed by the turbine result in a decrease in creep life.

This can be seen in Fig. 18.9, where the trend in the creep life usage, as the time to next overhaul, is shown when compressor fouling occurs. However, this decrease in creep life usage is somewhat misleading and the true picture emerges only when the simulator is run at the reduced gas turbine power available due to fouling (at about 37.3 MW), but when no

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft fouling is present. It is only then that the creep life usage is observed to decrease further, thus illustrating the actual impact of compressor fouling on turbine creep life usage. The reader is left to run the necessary simulation to determine the actual increase in the turbine creep life usage due to compressor fouling.

# 18.1.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in the combustion pressures and temperatures due to compressor fouling results in a decrease in NOₓ and an increase in CO, as shown in Fig. 18.10. Again, it is when the simulator is run at the reduced power available due to fouling, but when no fouling is present, that we observe an actual increase in NOₓ due to compressor fouling. The decrease in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO2 on a mass flow basis. However, the decrease in the thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index as shown in Fig. 18.10. Thus, in real terms, fouling increases NOx and CO2 emissions. The reader should run the simulator at the power available due to compressor fouling but when fouling is absent and determine the true impact of compressor fouling on NOx, CO and CO2 emissions.

# 18.1.8 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

18.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling.

Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration on the compressor characteristic, the change in the compressor non-dimensional flow with its pressure ratio is usually small and can be used to detect compressor fouling for a fixed geometry compressor. This was discussed in Section 9.1, where the change in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling was considered. Figure 18.11 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its speed. The figure also shows the change in this running line, which is shifted downwards due to compressor fouling. The compressor operating points for the clean and fouled cases are also shown on this figure. Such a plot is useful in detecting compressor fouling and is similar to that discussed previously where the effects of compressor fouling on a two-shaft gas turbine were considered.

# 18.2 Compressor fouling (low-power operation)

In Section 18.1 the effects of compressor fouling on the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine were considered when operating at high power so that the engine is always on an operating limit such as the EGT. The effects of compressor fouling are now considered when the gas turbine power demand is sufficiently low such that the engine never reaches an operating limit. This is achieved by setting the generator power demand to 35 MW and subjecting the engine to compressor fouling with ambient operating conditions as described in Section 18.1. As the compressor is being subjected to the same level of compressor fouling as when operating at high power levels, the trends in the

18.11 Effect of fouling on variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with speed.

# 18.2.1 Compressor characteristic, pressure and temperature ratios

As gas turbine speed and compressor inlet temperature do not change, the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to fouling is similar to that shown in Fig. 18.2. The main difference when operating at lower power is that the compressor pressure ratio is lower. However, the decrease in the compressor ratio due to fouling is smaller because operation is at a constant (lower) power output and the turbine entry temperature increases to maintain the power output of the gas turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.12. It is also observed that this differs from the corresponding case for the two-shaft gas turbine where the gas generator speed increases, thus partly compensating for the effects of compressor fouling by maintaining the compressor operating point on the compressor characteristic.

The decreases in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 18.13. To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the specific work must therefore increase as the mass flow rate decreases. This is achieved

by increasing the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and an increase in T₃/T₁ is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.13.

# 18.2.2 Trends in pressure and temperature

It has been seen that the compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease and therefore there is a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure and turbine inlet pressure during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.14. Compared with the case for the two-shaft gas turbine, these pressures remain essentially constant due to the increase in the gas generator speed during compressor fouling. The compressor inlet and turbine exit pressures do not change and this is due to maintaining constant ambient pressure during this simulation.

To maintain the power output of the gas turbine, the turbine entry temperature and thus the EGT increases. The compressor discharge temperature remains constant and this is due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed and the decrease in compressor pressure ratio and efficiency caused by fouling. Since the compressor discharge temperature and thus the cooling air temperature remain constant, the increase in turbine entry temperature results in the increase in turbine blade metal temperature. The increase in the turbine entry temperature also results in an increase in the combustion primary zone temperature. The trends in these temperatures can be seen in Fig. ",What role does the VIGV play in maintaining the air–fuel ratio in DLE engines during load changes?,The VIGV helps maintain a constant air–fuel ratio in DLE engines during load changes by adjusting the compressor flow to match the fuel flow.,"In DLE engines, the VIGV ensures the air–fuel ratio remains stable during load variations by modulating the compressor's air flow in response to fuel flow changes.","The VIGV's adjustment capability allows DLE engines to keep the air–fuel ratio constant during load changes, optimizing combustion efficiency.","By regulating compressor flow, the VIGV plays a crucial role in preserving the air–fuel ratio in DLE engines amidst fluctuating loads.","The VIGV's function in adjusting air flow is key to maintaining the air–fuel ratio in DLE engines during changes in load, ensuring efficient operation."
