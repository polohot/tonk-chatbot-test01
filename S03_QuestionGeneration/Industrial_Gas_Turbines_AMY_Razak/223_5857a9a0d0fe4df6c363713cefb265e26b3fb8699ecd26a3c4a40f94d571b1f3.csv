present, unlike the case when compressor fouling was considered (Fig. 13.24). The operating points on this figure have also been shown for the cases with and without hot end damage. The effect of hot end damage results in a reduction in compressor speed and compressor inlet flow for a given compressor inlet temperature and pressure. Since compressor fouling influences only the displacement of this running line, it is a good indication of compressor fouling.

The variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed when hot end damage is present is shown in Fig. 13.37. The case when no damage is present is also shown in the Figure. Unlike the previous case when the effect on compressor non-dimensional mass flow varying with its non-dimensional speed due to hot end damage was considered, here the running line is shifted down when hot end damage is present. It has also been observed that the variation of compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is influenced by compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.25. Thus the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is not a good indication of compressor fouling as this running line is influenced by other fault conditions.

The above fault condition may be simulated for a low power condition where no engine operating limits are reached. The user is left to carry out this simulation where the power demand from the generator may be set to 18.5 MW to represent the low power case.

# 13.3.2 Turbine damage due to rotor tip rub

In Section 9.4, the importance of maintaining the clearances between the turbine rotor tip and the casing was discussed. Turbine blade rubs may result from high vibration, thus increasing the clearance between the turbine rotor and casing. The impact of such damage largely affects the turbine efficiency, rather than the non-dimensional flow capacity. Thus, this fault condition is simulated by decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index and thereby reducing the turbine efficiency.

Such faults may happen in either the gas generator or power turbine. The effect of turbine rotor tip rubs on the power turbine will be simulated on this occasion. Furthermore, a low power case will be considered where the engine does not reach an operating limit such as the exhaust gas temperature limit. This may be achieved by setting the power demand from the generator to 18 MW. The reader is left to consider the high power case when engine-operating limits are reached. The power turbine rotor tip damage is simulated by reducing the power turbine efficiency fault index by 2% over a 10-second period.

Figure 13.38 shows the trend in this fault index. The power turbine efficiency fault index is observed changing from 0% to –2% in 10 seconds, as this is the fault being simulated.

# Figure 13.39

Operating point on the compressor characteristic due to power turbine damage.

Figure 13.39 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. The operating point is observed moving up the characteristic, thus increasing the compressor pressure ratio, non-dimensional flow and non-dimensional speed. Since the engine is not operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow will increase to meet the power demanded by the generator, thus producing these changes on the compressor characteristic.

# 370 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 13.40. Increases in the compressor and the power turbine pressure ratios are observed. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains constant because of the choke conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus any increase in the compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

Since the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves up due to this fault condition, the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ will also increase as shown in Fig. 13.40. Figure 13.41 shows the trends in pressure for the compressor and turbines.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.42. An increase in exhaust gas temperature, turbine entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are observed. This is due to the loss in the power turbine efficiency, thus requiring a higher firing temperature to maintain the generator power demand. The increase in power turbine exit temperature results from the increase in exhaust gas temperature and the loss in power turbine efficiency, although the power turbine pressure ratio has increased slightly, as shown in Fig. 13.40.

# Trends in flow

The trends in compressor inlet airflow, fuel flow and air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 13.43. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which is very similar to the fuel flow trend. The increase in airflow results because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the operating point moving up the running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 13.39.

# 13.43 Trends in flow due to power turbine damage.

The combustor temperature rise, T3 – T2, has been observed to increase due to the power turbine damage, as shown in Fig. 13.42, and results from the higher firing temperature, T3, needed to maintain the power demand, due to power turbine damage. Thus, the increase in combustion temperature results in a decrease in air–fuel ratio.

The loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the required power output. The fuel valve position increases in order to allow an increase in fuel flow to the gas turbine, enabling the power output demand to be maintained.

# Trends in speed

The trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds are shown in Fig. 13.44. As the operating point moves up the compressor characteristic due to the power turbine damage, the compressor non-dimensional speed must increase, as seen in Fig. 13.39. Since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant, there must be an increase in the gas generator speed to satisfy the required compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1.

# Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of hot end damage on the compressor speed and inlet flow?,Hot end damage results in a reduction in compressor speed and compressor inlet flow for a given compressor inlet temperature and pressure.,"The presence of hot end damage decreases both the compressor speed and the compressor inlet flow, under constant compressor inlet temperature and pressure conditions.","For a fixed compressor inlet temperature and pressure, hot end damage leads to lower compressor speed and reduced compressor inlet flow.","Compressor speed and inlet flow are reduced when hot end damage is present, assuming the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain unchanged.","The impact of hot end damage includes a decrease in the compressor's speed and a reduction in the flow at the compressor's inlet, given the same inlet temperature and pressure."

# Figure 13.39

Operating point on the compressor characteristic due to power turbine damage.

Figure 13.39 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. The operating point is observed moving up the characteristic, thus increasing the compressor pressure ratio, non-dimensional flow and non-dimensional speed. Since the engine is not operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow will increase to meet the power demanded by the generator, thus producing these changes on the compressor characteristic.

# 370 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 13.40. Increases in the compressor and the power turbine pressure ratios are observed. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains constant because of the choke conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus any increase in the compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

Since the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves up due to this fault condition, the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ will also increase as shown in Fig. 13.40. Figure 13.41 shows the trends in pressure for the compressor and turbines.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.42. An increase in exhaust gas temperature, turbine entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are observed. This is due to the loss in the power turbine efficiency, thus requiring a higher firing temperature to maintain the generator power demand. The increase in power turbine exit temperature results from the increase in exhaust gas temperature and the loss in power turbine efficiency, although the power turbine pressure ratio has increased slightly, as shown in Fig. 13.40.

# Trends in flow

The trends in compressor inlet airflow, fuel flow and air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 13.43. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which is very similar to the fuel flow trend. The increase in airflow results because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the operating point moving up the running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 13.39.

# 13.43 Trends in flow due to power turbine damage.

The combustor temperature rise, T3 – T2, has been observed to increase due to the power turbine damage, as shown in Fig. 13.42, and results from the higher firing temperature, T3, needed to maintain the power demand, due to power turbine damage. Thus, the increase in combustion temperature results in a decrease in air–fuel ratio.

The loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the required power output. The fuel valve position increases in order to allow an increase in fuel flow to the gas turbine, enabling the power output demand to be maintained.

# Trends in speed

The trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds are shown in Fig. 13.44. As the operating point moves up the compressor characteristic due to the power turbine damage, the compressor non-dimensional speed must increase, as seen in Fig. 13.39. Since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant, there must be an increase in the gas generator speed to satisfy the required compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1.

present, unlike the case when compressor fouling was considered (Fig. 13.24). The operating points on this figure have also been shown for the cases with and without hot end damage. The effect of hot end damage results in a reduction in compressor speed and compressor inlet flow for a given compressor inlet temperature and pressure. Since compressor fouling influences only the displacement of this running line, it is a good indication of compressor fouling.

The variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed when hot end damage is present is shown in Fig. 13.37. The case when no damage is present is also shown in the Figure. Unlike the previous case when the effect on compressor non-dimensional mass flow varying with its non-dimensional speed due to hot end damage was considered, here the running line is shifted down when hot end damage is present. It has also been observed that the variation of compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is influenced by compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.25. Thus the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is not a good indication of compressor fouling as this running line is influenced by other fault conditions.

The above fault condition may be simulated for a low power condition where no engine operating limits are reached. The user is left to carry out this simulation where the power demand from the generator may be set to 18.5 MW to represent the low power case.

# 13.3.2 Turbine damage due to rotor tip rub

In Section 9.4, the importance of maintaining the clearances between the turbine rotor tip and the casing was discussed. Turbine blade rubs may result from high vibration, thus increasing the clearance between the turbine rotor and casing. The impact of such damage largely affects the turbine efficiency, rather than the non-dimensional flow capacity. Thus, this fault condition is simulated by decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index and thereby reducing the turbine efficiency.

Such faults may happen in either the gas generator or power turbine. The effect of turbine rotor tip rubs on the power turbine will be simulated on this occasion. Furthermore, a low power case will be considered where the engine does not reach an operating limit such as the exhaust gas temperature limit. This may be achieved by setting the power demand from the generator to 18 MW. The reader is left to consider the high power case when engine-operating limits are reached. The power turbine rotor tip damage is simulated by reducing the power turbine efficiency fault index by 2% over a 10-second period.

Figure 13.38 shows the trend in this fault index. The power turbine efficiency fault index is observed changing from 0% to –2% in 10 seconds, as this is the fault being simulated.

Operating point on the compressor characteristic due to power turbine damage.

Figure 13.39 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. The operating point is observed moving up the characteristic, thus increasing the compressor pressure ratio, non-dimensional flow and non-dimensional speed. Since the engine is not operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow will increase to meet the power demanded by the generator, thus producing these changes on the compressor characteristic.

# 370 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 13.40. Increases in the compressor and the power turbine pressure ratios are observed. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains constant because of the choke conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus any increase in the compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

Since the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves up due to this fault condition, the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ will also increase as shown in Fig. 13.40. Figure 13.41 shows the trends in pressure for the compressor and turbines.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.42. An increase in exhaust gas temperature, turbine entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are observed. This is due to the loss in the power turbine efficiency, thus requiring a higher firing temperature to maintain the generator power demand.

The combustor temperature rise, T3 – T2, has been observed to increase due to the power turbine damage, as shown in Fig. 13.42, and results from the higher firing temperature, T3, needed to maintain the power demand, due to power turbine damage. Thus, the increase in combustion temperature results in a decrease in air–fuel ratio.

The loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the required power output. The fuel valve position increases in order to allow an increase in fuel flow to the gas turbine, enabling the power output demand to be maintained.

The trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds are shown in Fig. 13.44. As the operating point moves up the compressor characteristic due to the power turbine damage, the compressor non-dimensional speed must increase, as seen in Fig. 13.39. Since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant, there must be an increase in the gas generator speed to satisfy the required compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1.

The effect of hot end damage results in a reduction in compressor speed and compressor inlet flow for a given compressor inlet temperature and pressure. Since compressor fouling influences only the displacement of this running line, it is a good indication of compressor fouling.

# 13.43 Trends in flow due to power turbine damage.

The combustor temperature rise, T3 – T2, has been observed to increase due to the power turbine damage, as shown in Fig. 13.42, and results from the higher firing temperature, T3, needed to maintain the power demand, due to power turbine damage. Thus, the increase in combustion temperature results in a decrease in air–fuel ratio.

The loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the required power output. The fuel valve position increases in order to allow an increase in fuel flow to the gas turbine, enabling the power output demand to be maintained.

# Trends in speed

The trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds are shown in Fig. 13.44. As the operating point moves up the compressor characteristic due to the power turbine damage, the compressor non-dimensional speed must increase, as seen in Fig. 13.39. Since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant, there must be an increase in the gas generator speed to satisfy the required compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1.

# Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. ",Why does the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remain constant during power turbine damage?,The gas generator turbine pressure ratio stays constant because choke conditions in the power turbine prevent changes.,Choke conditions in the power turbine ensure the gas generator turbine's pressure ratio does not vary during damage.,Constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio is maintained due to the power turbine operating under choke conditions.,The pressure ratio of the gas generator turbine remains unchanged as the power turbine is in a choked state.,"Due to the power turbine being choked, the gas generator turbine's pressure ratio remains steady despite damage."

present, unlike the case when compressor fouling was considered (Fig. 13.24). The operating points on this figure have also been shown for the cases with and without hot end damage. The effect of hot end damage results in a reduction in compressor speed and compressor inlet flow for a given compressor inlet temperature and pressure. Since compressor fouling influences only the displacement of this running line, it is a good indication of compressor fouling.

The variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed when hot end damage is present is shown in Fig. 13.37. The case when no damage is present is also shown in the Figure. Unlike the previous case when the effect on compressor non-dimensional mass flow varying with its non-dimensional speed due to hot end damage was considered, here the running line is shifted down when hot end damage is present. It has also been observed that the variation of compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is influenced by compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.25. Thus the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is not a good indication of compressor fouling as this running line is influenced by other fault conditions.

The above fault condition may be simulated for a low power condition where no engine operating limits are reached. The user is left to carry out this simulation where the power demand from the generator may be set to 18.5 MW to represent the low power case.

# 13.3.2 Turbine damage due to rotor tip rub

In Section 9.4, the importance of maintaining the clearances between the turbine rotor tip and the casing was discussed. Turbine blade rubs may result from high vibration, thus increasing the clearance between the turbine rotor and casing. The impact of such damage largely affects the turbine efficiency, rather than the non-dimensional flow capacity. Thus, this fault condition is simulated by decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index and thereby reducing the turbine efficiency.

Such faults may happen in either the gas generator or power turbine. The effect of turbine rotor tip rubs on the power turbine will be simulated on this occasion. Furthermore, a low power case will be considered where the engine does not reach an operating limit such as the exhaust gas temperature limit. This may be achieved by setting the power demand from the generator to 18 MW. The reader is left to consider the high power case when engine-operating limits are reached. The power turbine rotor tip damage is simulated by reducing the power turbine efficiency fault index by 2% over a 10-second period.

Figure 13.38 shows the trend in this fault index. The power turbine efficiency fault index is observed changing from 0% to –2% in 10 seconds, as this is the fault being simulated.

Operating point on the compressor characteristic due to power turbine damage.

Figure 13.39 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. The operating point is observed moving up the characteristic, thus increasing the compressor pressure ratio, non-dimensional flow and non-dimensional speed. Since the engine is not operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow will increase to meet the power demanded by the generator, thus producing these changes on the compressor characteristic.

# 370 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 13.40. Increases in the compressor and the power turbine pressure ratios are observed. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains constant because of the choke conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus any increase in the compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

Since the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves up due to this fault condition, the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ will also increase as shown in Fig. 13.40. Figure 13.41 shows the trends in pressure for the compressor and turbines.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.42. An increase in exhaust gas temperature, turbine entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are observed. This is due to the loss in the power turbine efficiency, thus requiring a higher firing temperature to maintain the generator power demand. The increase in power turbine exit temperature results from the increase in exhaust gas temperature and the loss in power turbine efficiency, although the power turbine pressure ratio has increased slightly, as shown in Fig. 13.40.

The trends in compressor inlet airflow, fuel flow and air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 13.43. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which is very similar to the fuel flow trend.

# 13.3.2 Turbine damage due to rotor tip rub

In Section 9.4, the importance of maintaining the clearances between the turbine rotor tip and the casing was discussed. Turbine blade rubs may result from high vibration, thus increasing the clearance between the turbine rotor and casing. The impact of such damage largely affects the turbine efficiency, rather than the non-dimensional flow capacity. Thus, this fault condition is simulated by decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index and thereby reducing the turbine efficiency.

Such faults may happen in either the gas generator or power turbine. The effect of turbine rotor tip rubs on the power turbine will be simulated on this occasion. Furthermore, a low power case will be considered where the engine does not reach an operating limit such as the exhaust gas temperature limit. This may be achieved by setting the power demand from the generator to 18 MW. The reader is left to consider the high power case when engine-operating limits are reached. The power turbine rotor tip damage is simulated by reducing the power turbine efficiency fault index by 2% over a 10-second period.

Figure 13.38 shows the trend in this fault index. The power turbine efficiency fault index is observed changing from 0% to –2% in 10 seconds, as this is the fault being simulated.

Operating point on the compressor characteristic due to power turbine damage.

Figure 13.39 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. The operating point is observed moving up the characteristic, thus increasing the compressor pressure ratio, non-dimensional flow and non-dimensional speed. Since the engine is not operating on an engine limit, the fuel flow will increase to meet the power demanded by the generator, thus producing these changes on the compressor characteristic.

# 370 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

# Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the compressor and turbine pressure ratios are shown in Fig. 13.40. Increases in the compressor and the power turbine pressure ratios are observed. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains constant because of the choke conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus any increase in the compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

Since the operating point on the compressor characteristic moves up due to this fault condition, the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ will also increase as shown in Fig. 13.40. Figure 13.41 shows the trends in pressure for the compressor and turbines.

# Trends in temperature

The trends in temperature due to power turbine damage are shown in Fig. 13.42. An increase in exhaust gas temperature, turbine entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are observed. This is due to the loss in the power turbine efficiency, thus requiring a higher firing temperature to maintain the generator power demand. The increase in power turbine exit temperature results from the increase in exhaust gas temperature and the loss in power turbine efficiency, although the power turbine pressure ratio has increased slightly, as shown in Fig. 13.40.

# Trends in flow

The trends in compressor inlet airflow, fuel flow and air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 13.43. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which is very similar to the fuel flow trend. The increase in airflow results because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the operating point moving up the running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 13.39.

# 13.43 Trends in flow due to power turbine damage.

The combustor temperature rise, T3 – T2, has been observed to increase due to the power turbine damage, as shown in Fig. 13.42, and results from the higher firing temperature, T3, needed to maintain the power demand, due to power turbine damage. Thus, the increase in combustion temperature results in a decrease in air–fuel ratio.

The loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the required power output. The fuel valve position increases in order to allow an increase in fuel flow to the gas turbine, enabling the power output demand to be maintained.

# Trends in speed

The trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds are shown in Fig. 13.44. As the operating point moves up the compressor characteristic due to the power turbine damage, the compressor non-dimensional speed must increase, as seen in Fig. 13.39. Since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant, there must be an increase in the gas generator speed to satisfy the required compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1.

# Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of power turbine damage on fuel flow and valve position?,Fuel flow and valve position increase to maintain the required power output after power turbine damage.,"To uphold power demand post-damage, both fuel flow and the fuel valve position rise.",An increase in fuel flow and valve position is necessary to sustain power output following power turbine damage.,Power turbine damage necessitates higher fuel flow and an adjusted valve position to keep power output constant.,The loss in efficiency from power turbine damage requires more fuel flow and a greater valve opening to meet power demands.

present, unlike the case when compressor fouling was considered (Fig. 13.24). The operating points on this figure have also been shown for the cases with and without hot end damage. The effect of hot end damage results in a reduction in compressor speed and compressor inlet flow for a given compressor inlet temperature and pressure. Since compressor fouling influences only the displacement of this running line, it is a good indication of compressor fouling.

The variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed when hot end damage is present is shown in Fig. 13.37. The case when no damage is present is also shown in the Figure. Unlike the previous case when the effect on compressor non-dimensional mass flow varying with its non-dimensional speed due to hot end damage was considered, here the running line is shifted down when hot end damage is present. It has also been observed that the variation of compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is influenced by compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.25. Thus the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed is not a good indication of compressor fouling as this running line is influenced by other fault conditions.

The above fault condition may be simulated for a low power condition where no engine operating limits are reached. The user is left to carry out this simulation where the power demand from the generator may be set to 18.5 MW to represent the low power case.

The trends in compressor inlet airflow, fuel flow and air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 13.43. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which is very similar to the fuel flow trend. The increase in airflow results because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow due to the operating point moving up the running line on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 13.39.

# 13.43 Trends in flow due to power turbine damage.

The combustor temperature rise, T3 – T2, has been observed to increase due to the power turbine damage, as shown in Fig. 13.42, and results from the higher firing temperature, T3, needed to maintain the power demand, due to power turbine damage. Thus, the increase in combustion temperature results in a decrease in air–fuel ratio.

The loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the required power output. The fuel valve position increases in order to allow an increase in fuel flow to the gas turbine, enabling the power output demand to be maintained.

# Trends in speed

The trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds are shown in Fig. 13.44. As the operating point moves up the compressor characteristic due to the power turbine damage, the compressor non-dimensional speed must increase, as seen in Fig. 13.39. Since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant, there must be an increase in the gas generator speed to satisfy the required compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1.

# Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. ",What are the observed trends in power and thermal efficiency due to power turbine damage?,"Power output is maintained at the cost of increased fuel flow, leading to decreased thermal efficiency.",Thermal efficiency drops as more fuel is required to keep power output steady after damage.,The need for additional fuel to sustain power reduces the system's thermal efficiency post-damage.,"Maintaining power output necessitates higher fuel consumption, which in turn lowers thermal efficiency.",Damage to the power turbine results in lower thermal efficiency because more fuel is needed to maintain the same power output.
