The combustion primary zone temperature increases while the combustion pressure decreases, as discussed in Section 18.2.2. Although the decrease in combustion pressure would reduce NOx, the increase in combustion temperature is sufficient to result in an increase in the NOx emissions.

# 18.2.6 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The combustion primary zone temperature increases while the combustion pressure decreases, as discussed in Section 18.2.2. Although the decrease in combustion pressure would reduce NOx, the increase in combustion temperature is sufficient to result in an increase in the NOx emissions. These changes in combustion pressures and temperatures have little effect on CO emissions, which remain essentially constant.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index. The increase in the fuel flow to maintain the power required also results in an increase in CO2 emissions on a mass basis. The trends in these emissions are shown in Fig. ",How does the combustion pressure and temperature change affect NOx emissions?,"Increased combustion temperature outweighs the decrease in pressure, leading to higher NOx emissions.","Despite lower combustion pressure, the rise in temperature causes an increase in NOx emissions.",NOx emissions increase because the effect of higher combustion temperature exceeds that of reduced pressure.,"The text explains that higher combustion temperature results in more NOx, even with decreased pressure.","Elevated combustion temperature leads to increased NOx emissions, despite a drop in combustion pressure."

The trends in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and power output are shown in Fig. 18.18. The figure also shows the trend in the generator power output, which remains constant on the generator set point. The decrease in the thermal efficiency is due to the decrease in the compressor efficiency and pressure ratio.

# 18.2.5 Trends in turbine creep life

It has been shown that the turbine metal temperature increases during this simulation of compressor fouling, mainly because of the increase in the turbine entry temperature (Fig. 18.15). Although there is a reduction in the thermal efficiency (%),
