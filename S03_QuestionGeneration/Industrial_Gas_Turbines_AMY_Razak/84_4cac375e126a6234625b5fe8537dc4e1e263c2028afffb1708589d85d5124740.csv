# Gas turbine combustion

The power output of a gas turbine is controlled by the heat input, which is generated by burning fuel in the combustion chamber, using air from the discharge of the compressor. The use of hydrocarbon fuels is widespread in gas turbines. Liquid fuels such as kerosene, or gaseous fuels such as natural gas, are examples and the use of natural gas is becoming increasingly common in industrial gas turbines. The amount of heat input is often referred to as the net thermal input.

The combustion chamber exit temperature must be controlled to that required by the turbine in order that the creep life of the turbine component is not compromised. This is achieved by dividing the combustion process into two or three distinct parts. These are: the primary zone where the fuel is burnt and the heat from the fuel is released; an intermediate zone where additional air is introduced to complete the combustion; and the dilution zone where the remaining air is introduced to reduce the combustion chamber exit temperature to that required for the turbine.

As with compressors and turbines, combustion is a specialist area and only the fundamentals of gas turbine combustion are discussed in this chapter. The reader should consult references given at the end of this chapter for detailed information on aspects of gas turbine combustion.

# 6.1 Combustion of hydrocarbon fuels

Hydrocarbon fuels at atmospheric conditions do not burn in air spontaneously. In order to burn such fuels, they have to be heated to a high enough temperature where the fuel molecules are broken down into elementary parts called radicals. The energy input to produce these radicals is often called the activation energy. These radicals are generally unstable at normal atmospheric conditions and will revert back to their original hydrocarbon state in the absence of oxygen. However, such radicals have a strong affinity for oxygen and will readily react to form carbon dioxide and water and release heat in the process. Figure 6.1 summarises the combustion process.
