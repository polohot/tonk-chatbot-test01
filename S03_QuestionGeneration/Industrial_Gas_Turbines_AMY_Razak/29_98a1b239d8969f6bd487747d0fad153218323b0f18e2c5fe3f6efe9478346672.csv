2. **Thermal Efficiency**: The thermal efficiency (ηₜₕ) of the gas turbine is calculated as the ratio of net specific work output (Wₙₑₜ) to the heat input (Qin). If the turbine exit temperature is lower than optimal, it can reduce the net work output, thereby lowering the thermal efficiency. In the given example, ηₜₕ is calculated as ηₜₕ = Wₙₑₜ / Qin. A decrease in Wₙₑₜ due to a higher T₄ would result in a lower ηₜₕ.

3. **Heat Recovery**: The turbine exit temperature also influences the potential for heat recovery in combined cycle systems. A higher exit temperature may allow for better heat recovery, which can improve overall system efficiency. Conversely, if T₄ is too low, it may limit the effectiveness of heat recovery systems.

4. **Operational Limits**: The turbine exit temperature must also be managed within operational limits to avoid material degradation or failure. Operating at excessively high temperatures can lead to increased wear and tear, which may necessitate more frequent maintenance and reduce the turbine's overall lifespan and efficiency over time.
