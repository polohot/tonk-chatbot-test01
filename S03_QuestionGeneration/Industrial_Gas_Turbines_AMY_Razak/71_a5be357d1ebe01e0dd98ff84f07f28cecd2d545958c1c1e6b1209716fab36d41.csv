The change in the compressor characteristic due to stator closure is shown in dotted lines in Fig. 4.25. With the stators closed, the running line does not intersect the surge line at low compressor speeds and the engine can now be started. At high compressor speeds, the front stages start to choke, forcing the back stages to stall. It would be possible to open the stators of the front stages to allow more flow in an attempt to prevent the back stages from stalling. However, there is a limit to opening the stators and as a result it is thought that the maximum pressure ratio that can be achieved in a single spool is limited to about 20. 10,11
