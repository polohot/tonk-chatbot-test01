# 18.3 Compressor fouling at low-power operation

(Single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

In Section 18.2 the effects of compressor fouling when operating at low powers were considered such that no engine operating limit was reached during the simulation. Furthermore, these cases assumed that the VIGV remained open during compressor fouling. The effects of compressor fouling on engine performance are now considered when the VIGV is active during the normal power range of the gas turbine. Means to achieve active VIGV operation during the normal power range have been discussed in Chapter 16 and in this chapter, and are described in the simulator user guide on the CD.

Compressor fouling is introduced via fault indices as discussed earlier in this chapter and the fouling and ambient conditions are the same as that discussed previously. The power demand is set to 35 MW for the low power case. The case of maximum power can be considered, but this would be the same as that discussed in Section 18.1 as the VIGV would remain open since the engine power output is limited by the EGT.

At low ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine will be different, as the engine is power limited rather than EGT limited. The response

Since the level of fouling over the time period of 1 hour is the same as that discussed in Section 18.1, the trends in the fault indices will be the same as shown in Fig. ",What does the simulator user guide on the CD discuss regarding VIGV operation?,The simulator user guide on the CD discusses means to achieve active VIGV operation during the normal power range of the gas turbine.,It covers techniques for maintaining active VIGV operation within the gas turbine's standard power range.,Active VIGV operation methods in the normal power range are detailed in the CD's simulator guide.,The guide explains how to implement active VIGV functionality during typical power operations.,Details on enabling active VIGV operation across the gas turbine's power range are provided in the CD guide.
