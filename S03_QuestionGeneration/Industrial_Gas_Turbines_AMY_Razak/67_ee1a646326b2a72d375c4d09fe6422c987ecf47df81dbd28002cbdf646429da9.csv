As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What happens to the deflection and stage pressure ratio as the incidence increases in compressors?,"As the incidence increases, the deflection and thus the stage pressure ratio increases.",The stage pressure ratio rises with the increase in incidence due to enhanced deflection.,"Increased incidence leads to higher deflection, which in turn increases the stage pressure ratio.","Deflection and stage pressure ratio are directly influenced by the incidence, increasing as incidence does.","In compressors, a higher incidence results in greater deflection and consequently a higher stage pressure ratio."

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What are the effects of increasing stage inlet temperature on stage pressure ratio in high-pressure stages of a compressor?,"In high-pressure stages, increasing stage inlet temperature causes the stage pressure ratio to decrease due to the higher inlet temperature.",The stage pressure ratio diminishes in high-pressure stages as the stage inlet temperature rises.,Higher stage inlet temperatures in the compressor's high-pressure stages lead to a reduction in the stage pressure ratio.,"As the stage inlet temperature increases towards the compressor's high-pressure end, the stage pressure ratio falls.",Elevated stage inlet temperatures in the later stages of a compressor result in a lower stage pressure ratio.

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

ΔH/cₚ, where cₚ is the specific heat of air at constant pressure. The stage pressure ratio Rs can be calculated from the expression:

Rs = [ η ΔT ]γγ–1 [4.7]

where

- ηₛ is the stage isentropic efficiency
- γ = cₚ/cv (ratio of specific heats)
- T is the stage stagnation inlet temperature.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

|Surge line|Contours of constant isentropic efficiency (η)|
|---|---|
|P₁|P₂|
|Pressure ratio (|Non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁|
|Non-dimensional flow (W₁√T₁/P₁)| |

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What does the rapid increase in profile loss coefficient indicate in the context of blade incidence?,The rapid increase in profile loss coefficient indicates the onset of positive stall due to excessive diffusion.,"It signifies the beginning of positive stall, caused by too much diffusion.",This sharp rise points to positive stall initiation from over-diffusion.,"An indicator of positive stall starting, resulting from excessive diffusion.","The swift increase shows positive stall's commencement, owing to high diffusion levels."
