However, once stall begins, the deflection decreases rapidly as the deviation increases because the flow can no longer follow the blade profile. This onset of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, negatively impacting performance. Thus, while an increase in incidence can initially enhance performance, it ultimately leads to a decline in deflection and efficiency when stall occurs."

Assuming air as a perfect gas, ΔT can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta H}{c_p}
\]

where \( c_p \) is the specific heat of air at constant pressure. The value of ΔH can be derived from the stage-loading coefficient and the blade velocity, as shown in the worked example provided. For instance, if the stage-loading coefficient is 0.5 and the blade velocity is 250 m/s, ΔH can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H = 0.5 \times \frac{(U)^2}{1000}
\]

After calculating ΔH, ΔT can be found by dividing ΔH by \( c_p \). This temperature rise is crucial for determining the stage pressure ratio and overall performance of the gas turbine compressor."

The equation for the stage pressure ratio is given by:

\[ Rs = [ ηₛ ΔT ]^{\frac{γ}{γ-1}} \]

In this equation:

- ηₛ represents the stage isentropic efficiency, which indicates how effectively the compressor converts input energy into pressure energy without losses.
- ΔT is the temperature rise across the stage, which is influenced by the energy added to the air as it passes through the compressor.

A higher stage isentropic efficiency (ηₛ) means that the compressor is performing closer to the ideal isentropic process, resulting in a greater effective temperature rise (ΔT) for a given amount of energy input. This leads to a higher calculated stage pressure ratio (Rs). Conversely, a lower ηₛ indicates more losses in the process, resulting in a lower effective temperature rise and, consequently, a lower stage pressure ratio.

In summary, the stage isentropic efficiency is crucial for determining the effectiveness of the compressor and directly affects the calculated stage pressure ratio, with higher efficiencies leading to higher pressure ratios."

The process involves the following steps:

1. **Stage Calculations**: For each stage, you calculate the stage pressure ratio (Rs) using the formula:
   \[
   Rs = \left[ \eta_s \Delta T \right]^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}}
   \]
   where:
   - \(\eta_s\) is the stage isentropic efficiency,
   - \(\Delta T\) is the temperature rise in the stage,
   - \(\gamma\) is the ratio of specific heats.

2. **Temperature Rise**: The temperature rise (\(\Delta T\)) for each stage can be determined from the stagnation enthalpy rise (\(\Delta H\)) using the specific heat at constant pressure (\(c_p\)):
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{\Delta H}{c_p}
   \]

3. **Progressive Temperature Increase**: As you move through the stages, the stage inlet temperature increases progressively because the outlet temperature of the previous stage becomes the inlet temperature for the next stage. 

4. **Iterative Calculation**: You repeat the calculations for each stage, using the outlet temperature of the previous stage as the inlet temperature for the next stage. This means that for each stage, you recalculate \(\Delta T\) and subsequently the stage pressure ratio \(Rs\).

5. **Overall Pressure Ratio**: The overall pressure ratio for the entire compressor is obtained by multiplying the pressure ratios of all individual stages:
   \[
   \text{Overall Pressure Ratio} = Rs_1 \times Rs_2 \times \ldots \times Rs_n
   \]
   where \(Rs_n\) is the pressure ratio of the nth stage.

By following this method, you can calculate the overall pressure ratio for a compressor consisting of multiple stages, taking into account the increasing inlet temperatures and the corresponding changes in performance characteristics at each stage."

It is used in the calculation of the stage stagnation enthalpy rise (ΔH), which is given by the formula ΔH = 0.5(U²)/1000, where U is the blade velocity. The temperature rise in the stage can be expressed as ΔT = ΔH/cₚ. This means that the higher the specific heat (cₚ), the lower the temperature rise (ΔT) for a given enthalpy rise (ΔH).

This process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Stage Calculations**: For each stage, calculate the stage pressure ratio, temperature rise, and other relevant parameters using the individual stage characteristics. This includes using equations such as the one provided for the stage pressure ratio (Rs) and the temperature rise (ΔT).

2. **Progressive Temperature Increases**: As the compressor operates, the inlet temperature for each subsequent stage will increase due to the temperature rise from the previous stage. Therefore, the outlet temperature of one stage becomes the inlet temperature for the next stage.

3. **Iterative Calculations**: Repeat the calculations for each stage, using the outlet temperature of the previous stage as the inlet temperature for the next. This iterative process allows for the accumulation of temperature rises and the adjustment of pressure ratios based on the increasing inlet temperatures.

4. **Overall Pressure Ratio**: After calculating the characteristics for all individual stages, the overall pressure ratio of the compressor can be determined by multiplying the pressure ratios of each stage together or by using the results from the iterative calculations.

5. **Graphical Representation**: Finally, the overall compressor characteristics can be graphically represented to illustrate the performance across all stages, showing how the compressor behaves as a whole rather than just as individual stages.

As the temperature rises, the stage pressure ratio decreases because the higher inlet temperature affects the performance of the compressor stages. This is due to the fact that the temperature rise per stage remains constant, but as you progress through the compressor, the inlet temperature for each subsequent stage increases, resulting in a lower pressure ratio at the higher-pressure stages."

Specifically, ΔH is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Stage-loading coefficient} \cdot U^2 / 1000

This calculation shows that the blade velocity directly influences the kinetic energy imparted to the air, which in turn affects the enthalpy rise across the compressor stage. A higher blade velocity would lead to a greater ΔH, indicating a more significant increase in energy and temperature of the air as it passes through the compressor stages. Thus, the blade velocity is a key factor in determining the performance characteristics of the gas turbine."

Specifically, γ is defined as the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure (cₚ) to the specific heat at constant volume (cᵥ). 

In gas turbines, γ influences several key aspects:

1. **Stage Pressure Ratio Calculation**: The stage pressure ratio (Rs) is calculated using the expression that incorporates γ. This ratio is essential for understanding the efficiency and performance of each stage of the compressor. A higher γ typically indicates a greater ability of the gas to do work, which can lead to improved performance.

3. **Temperature Rise**: The temperature rise in the gas during compression is also dependent on γ. As the gas is compressed, the change in temperature is influenced by the specific heats, which are in turn dictated by the value of γ. This temperature rise is a key factor in the overall efficiency and power output of the turbine.

4. **Flow Dynamics**: The ratio of specific heats affects the flow dynamics and behavior of the gas as it passes through the turbine and compressor stages. It influences the speed of sound in the gas, which is important for understanding compressibility effects and shock waves in high-speed flows.

In the context of compressor performance, isentropic efficiency (η₁₂) is defined as the ratio of the actual work done by the compressor to the ideal work that would be done in an isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) process.

In simpler terms, it compares the actual performance of the compressor to the best possible performance under ideal conditions. A higher isentropic efficiency implies that the compressor is operating closer to its theoretical maximum efficiency, meaning it is effectively compressing the air with minimal energy losses due to factors like friction, turbulence, and heat transfer.

In the overall compressor characteristic, isentropic efficiency is represented as one of the non-dimensional groups, allowing for a standardized way to evaluate and compare the performance of different compressors across various operating conditions."

Specifically, the pressure ratio (P₂/P₁) indicates the ratio of the pressure at the discharge of the compressor (P₂) to the pressure at the inlet (P₁). 

In the context of compressor characteristics, the pressure ratio helps in understanding how effectively the compressor can increase the pressure of the incoming air or gas. It is essential for assessing the efficiency and performance of the compressor across different operating conditions. By analyzing the pressure ratio in conjunction with other parameters such as non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, and isentropic efficiency, engineers can generate a comprehensive overall compressor characteristic that reflects the effects of all the stages within the compressor.

Additionally, the pressure ratio is critical in identifying performance issues such as choking and rotating stall, which can lead to losses in efficiency and operational stability. Therefore, monitoring and analyzing the pressure ratio is vital for optimizing compressor design and performance."

This is achieved using techniques such as stage stacking, which integrates the performance of all stages into a single representation. The overall characteristic is typically depicted using non-dimensional groups, including non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio, and isentropic efficiency. These groups help in understanding the compressor's performance across different operating conditions."

When choking occurs, the flow through the compressor becomes limited, leading to several key effects:

1. **Vertical Constant Speed Lines**: As the speed of the compressor increases, the constant speed lines on the compressor characteristic diagram become vertical and bunch together. This indicates that at higher speeds, the compressor operates closer to its choking limit, which restricts the flow.

2. **Reduced Efficiency**: Choking can lead to increased losses in the compressor, particularly as the flow becomes more turbulent and less stable. This can result in a decrease in the overall isentropic efficiency of the compressor.

3. **Surge Risk**: The onset of choking can also increase the risk of surge, a condition where the flow reverses and leads to instability in the compressor operation. This can cause significant performance degradation and potential damage to the compressor.

4. **Flow Limitations**: Choking effectively limits the maximum flow rate that the compressor can handle at a given pressure ratio and speed. This means that the compressor may not be able to achieve its designed performance levels under certain operating conditions.

Overall, choking in the inlet stages of a compressor can severely impact its operational efficiency, stability, and ability to maintain desired performance characteristics."
