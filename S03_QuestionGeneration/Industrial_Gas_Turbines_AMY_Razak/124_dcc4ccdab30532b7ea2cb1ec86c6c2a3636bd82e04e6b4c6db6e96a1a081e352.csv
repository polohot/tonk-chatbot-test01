# 7.11 Variable geometry compressors

The use of variable geometry in compressors has been discussed in Chapter 4 (variable inlet guide vanes and stators, VIGVs and VSVs, respectively) to prevent compressor instabilities such as compressor stall and surge. Although the compressor characteristic will indeed change with the position of such variable geometry devices (guide vane angle), the control philosophy of these devices applied to a two- or three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is such that the compressor non-dimensional speed is used in determining the position of the VIGV and VSV. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV and VSV position or guide vane angle which, in turn, fixes the compressor flow capacity, pressure ratio and efficiency. Provided the compressor characteristic employed in the prediction of the off-design performance of such engine configurations includes the effect of the position of these variable geometry devices in the compressor, then no change in the procedures given previously for predicting the off-design performance of such engines is necessary.

Single-shaft gas turbines, particularly generating large power outputs (above about 50 MW), also employ variable geometry in the compressor, usually VIGVs. The purpose of variable geometry in compressors employed by single-shaft gas turbines is to control the air flow through the compressor, such that the turbine exit temperature (also known as the exhaust gas temperature) is maintained at some predetermined value. Controlling the exhaust gas temperature by such means results in a reduction in the compressor flows at low power outputs, thus significantly decreasing the starting power requirements of the gas turbine. Variable geometry may also be employed to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at its design value at low power. Maintaining the exhaust gas temperature at the design value at low powers is particularly beneficial to the thermal efficiency at these powers when a heat exchanger is added or when the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant. Furthermore, the fuel–air ratio remains approximately constant at constant exhaust gas temperature operation, which is particularly useful in DLE combustion systems, as discussed in Chapter 6 on gas turbine combustion.

Unlike the case of a free power turbine discussed above, the compressor characteristic needs to be known for each VIGV and VSV setting (angle). Furthermore, an additional estimate and check is necessary when predicting the off-design performance of a single-shaft gas turbine operating with variable geometry compressors. This estimate and check corresponds to the guide

# 7.12 Variable geometry turbines

Turbines may also incorporate variable geometry and this is usually applied to power turbines where the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) are turned to alter the flow capacity and thus the turbine characteristic. Variable geometry has been employed in turbines operating with free power turbines to improve the off-design thermal efficiency (i.e. low power outputs), particularly when a heat exchanger is added. Variable geometry power turbines also provide improved acceleration when the NGVs are full opened and can also be used to provide substantial engine braking when the NGVs are rotated sufficiently, such that the gases leaving the NGV impinge on the turbine rotor in the opposite direction.

The prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines employing variable geometry turbines requires an additional estimate and check vector, which correspond to the NGV angle and the required exhaust gas temperature, respectively. The exhaust gas temperature may be measured downstream of the gas generator turbine rather than at the power turbine exit. It is also necessary to know the change in the turbine characteristic with NGV angle, and the appropriate turbine characteristic must be used as the NGV angle changes during the iterations described above.

# 7.11 Variable geometry compressors

The use of variable geometry in compressors has been discussed in Chapter 4 (variable inlet guide vanes and stators, VIGVs and VSVs, respectively) to prevent compressor instabilities such as compressor stall and surge. Although the compressor characteristic will indeed change with the position of such variable geometry devices (guide vane angle), the control philosophy of these devices applied to a two- or three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is such that the compressor non-dimensional speed is used in determining the position of the VIGV and VSV. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV and VSV position or guide vane angle which, in turn, fixes the compressor flow capacity, pressure ratio and efficiency. Provided the compressor characteristic employed in the prediction of the off-design performance of such engine configurations includes the effect of the position of these variable geometry devices in the compressor, then no change in the procedures given previously for predicting the off-design performance of such engines is necessary.

Single-shaft gas turbines, particularly generating large power outputs (above about 50 MW), also employ variable geometry in the compressor, usually VIGVs. The purpose of variable geometry in compressors employed by single-shaft gas turbines is to control the air flow through the compressor, such that the turbine exit temperature (also known as the exhaust gas temperature) is maintained at some predetermined value. Controlling the exhaust gas temperature by such means results in a reduction in the compressor flows at low power outputs, thus significantly decreasing the starting power requirements of the gas turbine. Variable geometry may also be employed to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at its design value at low power. Maintaining the exhaust gas temperature at the design value at low powers is particularly beneficial to the thermal efficiency at these powers when a heat exchanger is added or when the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant. Furthermore, the fuel–air ratio remains approximately constant at constant exhaust gas temperature operation, which is particularly useful in DLE combustion systems, as discussed in Chapter 6 on gas turbine combustion.

Unlike the case of a free power turbine discussed above, the compressor characteristic needs to be known for each VIGV and VSV setting (angle). Furthermore, an additional estimate and check is necessary when predicting the off-design performance of a single-shaft gas turbine operating with variable geometry compressors. This estimate and check corresponds to the guide

# 7.12 Variable geometry turbines

Turbines may also incorporate variable geometry and this is usually applied to power turbines where the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) are turned to alter the flow capacity and thus the turbine characteristic. Variable geometry has been employed in turbines operating with free power turbines to improve the off-design thermal efficiency (i.e. low power outputs), particularly when a heat exchanger is added. Variable geometry power turbines also provide improved acceleration when the NGVs are full opened and can also be used to provide substantial engine braking when the NGVs are rotated sufficiently, such that the gases leaving the NGV impinge on the turbine rotor in the opposite direction.

The prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines employing variable geometry turbines requires an additional estimate and check vector, which correspond to the NGV angle and the required exhaust gas temperature, respectively. The exhaust gas temperature may be measured downstream of the gas generator turbine rather than at the power turbine exit. It is also necessary to know the change in the turbine characteristic with NGV angle, and the appropriate turbine characteristic must be used as the NGV angle changes during the iterations described above.

Similarly, the off-design performance of two- and three-shaft gas turbines may be predicted as discussed in Sections 7.6 and 7.7 using intercooling and reheat, and the reader is left to develop the necessary vector data to predict the off-design performance of these cycles.

# 7.11 Variable geometry compressors

The use of variable geometry in compressors has been discussed in Chapter 4 (variable inlet guide vanes and stators, VIGVs and VSVs, respectively) to prevent compressor instabilities such as compressor stall and surge. Although the compressor characteristic will indeed change with the position of such variable geometry devices (guide vane angle), the control philosophy of these devices applied to a two- or three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine is such that the compressor non-dimensional speed is used in determining the position of the VIGV and VSV. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV and VSV position or guide vane angle which, in turn, fixes the compressor flow capacity, pressure ratio and efficiency. Provided the compressor characteristic employed in the prediction of the off-design performance of such engine configurations includes the effect of the position of these variable geometry devices in the compressor, then no change in the procedures given previously for predicting the off-design performance of such engines is necessary.

Single-shaft gas turbines, particularly generating large power outputs (above about 50 MW), also employ variable geometry in the compressor, usually VIGVs. The purpose of variable geometry in compressors employed by single-shaft gas turbines is to control the air flow through the compressor, such that the turbine exit temperature (also known as the exhaust gas temperature) is maintained at some predetermined value. Controlling the exhaust gas temperature by such means results in a reduction in the compressor flows at low power outputs, thus significantly decreasing the starting power requirements of the gas turbine. Variable geometry may also be employed to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at its design value at low power. Maintaining the exhaust gas temperature at the design value at low powers is particularly beneficial to the thermal efficiency at these powers when a heat exchanger is added or when the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant. Furthermore, the fuel–air ratio remains approximately constant at constant exhaust gas temperature operation, which is particularly useful in DLE combustion systems, as discussed in Chapter 6 on gas turbine combustion.

Unlike the case of a free power turbine discussed above, the compressor characteristic needs to be known for each VIGV and VSV setting (angle). Furthermore, an additional estimate and check is necessary when predicting the off-design performance of a single-shaft gas turbine operating with variable geometry compressors. This estimate and check corresponds to the guide

# 7.12 Variable geometry turbines

Turbines may also incorporate variable geometry and this is usually applied to power turbines where the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) are turned to alter the flow capacity and thus the turbine characteristic. Variable geometry has been employed in turbines operating with free power turbines to improve the off-design thermal efficiency (i.e. low power outputs), particularly when a heat exchanger is added. Variable geometry power turbines also provide improved acceleration when the NGVs are full opened and can also be used to provide substantial engine braking when the NGVs are rotated sufficiently, such that the gases leaving the NGV impinge on the turbine rotor in the opposite direction.

The prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines employing variable geometry turbines requires an additional estimate and check vector, which correspond to the NGV angle and the required exhaust gas temperature, respectively. The exhaust gas temperature may be measured downstream of the gas generator turbine rather than at the power turbine exit. It is also necessary to know the change in the turbine characteristic with NGV angle, and the appropriate turbine characteristic must be used as the NGV angle changes during the iterations described above.
