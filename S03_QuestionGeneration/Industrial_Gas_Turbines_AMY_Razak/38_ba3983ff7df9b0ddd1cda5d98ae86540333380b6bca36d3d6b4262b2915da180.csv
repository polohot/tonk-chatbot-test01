In thermodynamics, a reaction is spontaneous if it leads to an increase in the total entropy of the system and its surroundings. 

The change in entropy (ΔS) during a chemical reaction can be calculated using the following approaches:

1. **Standard Entropy Values**: The change in entropy for a reaction can be calculated using standard entropy values (S°) of the reactants and products. The formula is:
   \[
   ΔS = Σ S°_{products} - Σ S°_{reactants}
   \]
   where Σ denotes the sum over all products and reactants.

\[ G = H - TS \]

where:
- \( H \) is the enthalpy of the system,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin),
