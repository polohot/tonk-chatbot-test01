The evaluation of the heat exchanger effectiveness depends on the type of heat exchanger. The types of heat exchangers that have been employed by gas turbines are counter- and cross-flow recuperators, where the heat exchange takes place through a separating (conducting) wall, and regenerators. With regenerators, the hot exhaust gases heats a matrix, after which the cold air is passed through the matrix to absorb the heat given up by the hot gases. Thus, with regenerators the matrix requires a large thermal capacity whereas with recuperators, the separating wall requires a small thermal capacity and good conduction.

The effectiveness of the heat exchanger may be determined from its performance curves, which depend on the type of the heat exchanger, as discussed above. The performance curves for a heat exchanger are shown in Fig. 2.18, where the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is plotted against the number of transfer units (NTU).
