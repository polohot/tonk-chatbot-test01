The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18. The open and closed loop responses of the VIGV control system is clearly shown for each step increase in the power demand from the generator. The corresponding trends in gas turbine temperatures are shown in Fig. ",What effect does the decrease in compressor flow capacity have on the compressor pressure ratio?,The decrease in compressor flow capacity results in a decrease in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.,"Due to reduced flow capacity, the compressor's pressure ratio drops to maintain flow compatibility.","A lower flow capacity in the compressor leads to a reduced pressure ratio, ensuring flow compatibility is maintained.","The compressor pressure ratio decreases as a direct consequence of the compressor's diminished flow capacity, aligning with flow compatibility requirements.",Flow compatibility between compressor and turbine necessitates a decrease in pressure ratio when compressor flow capacity diminishes.

The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18. The open and closed loop responses of the VIGV control system is clearly shown for each step increase in the power demand from the generator. The corresponding trends in gas turbine temperatures are shown in Fig. ",Why is maintaining a constant air–fuel ratio important for reducing gas turbine emissions?,Maintaining a constant air–fuel ratio is crucial for reducing emissions like NOₓ and CO by keeping combustion temperature within strict limits.,"A steady air–fuel ratio ensures combustion temperature stays within bounds, significantly lowering NOₓ and CO emissions.","To minimize emissions, it's essential to keep the air–fuel ratio constant, thereby controlling combustion temperature.","Constant air–fuel ratios are key to emission reduction, as they maintain combustion temperatures at levels that limit NOₓ and CO production.","Keeping the air–fuel ratio unchanged is vital for emission control, as it stabilizes combustion temperature, reducing pollutants."
