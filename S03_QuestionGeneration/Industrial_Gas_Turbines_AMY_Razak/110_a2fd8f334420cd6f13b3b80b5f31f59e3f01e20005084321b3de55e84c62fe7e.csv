# Step 3 – Combustor

# Step 3.1

Using the estimated combustor exit temperature or turbine entry temperature, T3, calculate the fuel flow, mf, using the temperature rise, T3–T2, combustor inlet temperature T2 and the combustion charts (Fig. 2.17 in Chapter 2).

# Step 3.2

Calculate the combustor exit pressure, P3 using Equations 7.6 and 7.7.

ΔP23 = PLF × ⌈ W2 R T /γ ⌉2 ⎛ ⌈ T ⌉ ⎜

where PLF is the power loss factor, K1 and K2 are the cold loss (which corresponds to the combustion pressure loss due to friction), and hot loss or fundamental loss (which corresponds to the combustion pressure loss due to heat addition) of the combustor (See Section 6.7 in Chapter 6):

P3 = P2 ⌈ ΔP23 ⌉ [7.6]

P3 = P2 × (1 - P2)

# Step 3.3

Calculate the exit mass flow. In the absence of bleeds:

W3 = W2 + mf [7.8]

# Step 4 – Turbine

# Step 4.1

Calculate the turbine inlet non-dimensional flow, pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed W3 R T /γ P N, respectively.

# Step 4.2

Using the turbine pressure ratio P3 and the calculated non-dimensional speed γ N3 in step 4.1, determine the turbine inlet non-dimensional speed.

⌈ W3 R T /γ ⌉

⌊ 3 3 3 ⌋ and isentropic efficiency η3₄ by interpolation using the turbine characteristic (Figs. 7.2 and 7.3).

# Step 4.3

Calculate the turbine exit temperature and power output using:

T4 = T3 – T1 × η34 ⌈ P4 ⌉γg–1 ⎜

⎜ P3 ⎝

tpow = W3 × cpg(T3 – T4) [7.10]

where γg and cpg are the mean isentropic index and specific heat at constant pressure between T3 and T4.

# Step 5 – Check 1

# Step 5.1

Compare the calculated turbine inlet non-dimensional flows

⌈ W3 R T /γ ⌉

⌊ 3 3 3 ⌋

⎜ P3 ⎝

in step 4.1 and the turbine inlet non-dimensional flow determined from the turbine characteristic, in step 4.2. If they do not agree, return to step 3, estimate a different T3 and repeat to step 5.1 until the two values for turbine inlet non-dimensional flows agree.

# Step 6 – Check 2

# Step 6.1

Calculate the net turbine power output, pnet using

pnet = tpow – cpow [7.11]

# Step 6.2

Compare the calculated turbine power output with the required power output from the gas turbine. If they do not agree, return to step 2, estimate a different compressor pressure ratio ⌈ P2 ⌉ and repeat to step 6.2 until the powers agree.

# Step 7 – Check 3

# Step 7.1

Compare the compressor speed, N1 calculated in step 2 with the speed required by the load. If they do not agree, estimate a different compressor inlet mass flow, W1, return to step 2 and repeat to step 7.1 until the speeds agree.

# 7.3 Off-design performance prediction of a two-shaft gas turbine with a free power turbine

Gas turbines employing free power turbines are widely used where the speed of the load changes significantly. Applications where the load speed changes are pumps, gas compressors and fixed pitch propellers used in marine propulsion. They are generally designed for smaller power ranges (up to about 50 MW) compared with single shaft gas turbines and are also employed in power generation when no single shaft gas turbine is available in this power range. A schematic representation of a two-shaft gas turbine using a free power turbine is shown in Fig. 7.5. There is no mechanical coupling between the gas generator turbine and the power turbine but there exists a strong fluid or aerodynamic coupling between the gas generator turbine and the power turbine.

Air enters the compressor at station 1 as shown in Fig. ",What applications are two-shaft gas turbines with a free power turbine particularly suited for?,"They are ideal for applications with significant load speed changes, such as pumps, gas compressors, and marine propulsion.","Two-shaft gas turbines with free power turbines are best for variable speed loads like pumps, compressors, and marine propellers.","Applications include those requiring speed variation, such as pumps, gas compressors, and fixed pitch propellers in marine use.","They are suited for loads with changing speeds, including pumps, gas compressors, and marine propulsion systems.","These turbines are particularly designed for applications where load speed varies, such as in pumps, compressors, and marine propulsion."
