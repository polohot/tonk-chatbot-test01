1. **Temperature**: Higher combustion temperatures can lead to increased formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are significant pollutants. The temperature affects the chemical reactions occurring during combustion, influencing the efficiency of fuel consumption and the formation of various emissions.

2. **Pressure**: The pressure within the combustion chamber can affect the combustion process and the mixing of fuel and air. Higher pressures can enhance the combustion efficiency, potentially reducing emissions. However, they can also lead to increased formation of certain pollutants if not managed properly.

3. **Humidity**: Humidity levels can impact the combustion process by affecting the fuel-air mixture. High humidity can lead to a reduction in combustion efficiency, potentially increasing emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, humidity can influence the formation of water vapor, which can also affect the overall emissions profile.
