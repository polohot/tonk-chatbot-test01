The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is largely attributed to the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure.

# 12.1.3 Trends in pressure

The compressor and turbine pressure ratios are constant during the decrease in the ambient pressure, and any fall in ambient pressure will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure will be directly proportional to the ambient pressure. Similarly, the gas generator and power turbine inlet and exit pressures also fall proportionally with the ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.4.

# 12.1.4 Trends in creep life

The trends in creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbines during the ambient pressure transient are shown in Fig. 12.5. Observe that the creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbine decreases as the ambient pressure decreases. Note from Fig. 12.3 that the power output also decreases with the decrease in ambient pressure. Therefore, the torque acting on the power turbine blades must decrease, as the power turbine speed is constant.

This reduction in torque will result in a lower total stress level on the blades, although the centrifugal stress is constant. Since the exhaust gas temperature remains constant, the lower stress levels result in a decrease in creep life usage of the power turbine.

A similar situation exists for the gas generator turbine. Because of the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the gas generator speed and the turbine entry temperature will also remain constant. Furthermore, the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor discharge temperature and hence the cooling air temperature will also remain constant. Since the airflow through the compressor decreases with the ambient pressure, the power absorbed by the compressor will also reduce. All the power required by the compressor is provided by the gas generator turbine, so the power produced by the gas generator turbine will also reduce. Although the gas generator turbine speed and temperature are constant during the ambient pressure transient, the reduced compressor power demand results in less torque in the gas generator turbine blades. The lower stresses in the gas generator turbine blades due to the lower torque requirements result in a decrease in the gas generator turbine creep life usage and can be seen in Fig. 12.5.

# 12.1.5 Trends in emissions

Figure 12.6 shows the trends in NOx, CO and CO2 emissions. Observe that the compressor discharge pressure decreases with ambient pressure, leading to a decrease in combustion pressure. The combustion temperature remains constant due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus, the decrease in combustion pressure results in a decrease in NOx emission and an increase in CO emissions. Also, the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure will contribute to the reduction in NOx.

Since the fuel flow decreases with ambient pressure, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis also decrease with reduced ambient pressure and follow the fuel flow trend. The thermal efficiency decreases slightly as discussed above.

# 12.2 Effect of ambient pressure changes on engine performance at lower power outputs

Section 12.1 considered the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance when the engine performance is constrained by an engine operating limit, as would be encountered at high-power output levels. Consider now the impact of change in the ambient pressure when the engine is operating at lower power such that no engine operating limits are encountered. The same ambient pressure transient used previously will be repeated (i.e. reducing the ambient pressure from 1.03 to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour), with the ambient temperature set to 15 degrees Celsius, and inlet and exhaust losses set to 100 mm water gauge. The generator power demand is set to 17.5 MW throughout the simulation to represent the low power case.

Since the power output of the gas turbine will be constant throughout the simulation as no engine limits are reached, the non-dimensional power, Power/(P √T), will increase as the ambient pressure P₁ decreases. Referring to Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional power with compressor non-dimensional speed, any increase in non-dimensional power must be accompanied by an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus the increase in non-dimensional speed will result in increases in other non-dimensional parameters such as pressure ratios, temperature ratios and non-dimensional flows.

# 12.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic for the low power case is shown in Fig. 12.7. The operation point is observed moving up the running line from a lower compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio to a higher compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. This is due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient pressure decreases.

# 12.2.2 Trends in speed

The ambient pressure transient results in an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ and therefore an increase in gas generator speed due to a constant ambient temperature, T₁. This is shown in Fig. 12.8, which illustrates the changes in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed during the ambient pressure transient.

It is also observed that the rate of increase in gas generator speed increases.

Dimensional speed results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, as can be observed in Fig. 11.4. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. An increase in T₃/T₁ is necessary because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

# 12.2.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Since no engine operating limits are exceeded during the ambient pressure transient, the power required by the generator will always be provided by the gas turbine. Thus the generator power output trend remains on the power demand set point. Hence, the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain essentially constant during this ambient pressure transient, as can be seen in Fig. 12.10, which shows the trends in powers and thermal efficiencies during the ambient pressure transient. The slight increase in gas power is due primarily to a small decrease in the power turbine isentropic efficiency. As the ambient pressure decreases, the exhaust gas temperature increases to maintain the generator power demand. The power turbine non-dimensional speed now decreases (note that the power turbine speed is constant), resulting in a small decrease in power turbine efficiency. Thus a

# 12.10 Trends in the power and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

The corresponding increase in gas power output occurs to maintain the power demand from the generator as observed in Fig. 12.10. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency, which represents the efficiency of the gas generator, increase as the ambient pressure decreases. As was seen in Fig. 12.9, the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ increase as the ambient pressure decreases. The thermal efficiencies essentially are functions of these ratios and independent of ambient pressure as discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the increases in the compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in increases in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas generator thermal efficiency. Therefore, when the power demand is below the maximum capacity of the engine, a low ambient pressure is desirable because it results in an increase in thermal efficiency. It is worth pointing out that this is indeed the principle of a closed cycle gas turbine where we reduce the cycle working pressure to reduce the load, thus maintaining a constant thermal efficiency at lower loads. Such closed cycle gas turbines have been built and operated as a means of overcoming the poor thermal efficiencies of gas turbines at low loads.

# 12.11 Trends in flow during ambient pressure transient.

The compressor pressure ratio and the temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increase during the ambient pressure transient. The specific work will increase and this is due to the increase in T₃/T₁. As the power output remains constant (see Fig. 12.10), the increase in specific work will result in a decrease in compressor inlet air flow as shown in Fig. 12.11.

It is worth noting that the decrease in compressor flow, compared with the previous case, where the engine was operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit (Fig. 12.2), is smaller. This is due to the resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow and speed for this case, whereas in the previous case the compressor non-dimensional flow remained constant as the ambient pressure decreased.

The trends in the fuel flow and fuel valve position also show a decline. This is due primarily to the increased thermal efficiency. Since the power output remains constant, any increase in the thermal efficiency must result in a decrease in fuel flow, as shown in Fig. 12.11. The air–fuel ratio decreases because of the increase in T₃/T₁, as shown in Fig. 12.9. This results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the ambient temperature, T₁ is constant during this transient. Although there is an increase in the compressor discharge temperature, thus also an increase in combustion inlet temperature, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio (see Fig. 12.9), the increase in T₃ is greater, as shown in Fig. 12.12. Hence, the combustion temperature rises as the ambient pressure decreases. The net effect of the increase in combustion temperature rise is a decrease in the air–fuel ratio, as observed in Fig. 12.11.

It is worth noting that the decrease in compressor flow, compared with the previous case, where the engine was operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit (Fig. 12.2), is smaller. This is due to the resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow and speed for this case, whereas in the previous case the compressor non-dimensional flow remained constant as the ambient pressure decreased.

The trends in the fuel flow and fuel valve position also show a decline. This is due primarily to the increased thermal efficiency. Since the power output remains constant, any increase in the thermal efficiency must result in a decrease in fuel flow, as shown in Fig. 12.11. The air–fuel ratio decreases because of the increase in T₃/T₁, as shown in Fig. 12.9. This results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the ambient temperature, T₁ is constant during this transient. Although there is an increase in the compressor discharge temperature, thus also an increase in combustion inlet temperature, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio (see Fig. 12.9), the increase in T₃ is greater, as shown in Fig. 12.12. Hence, the combustion temperature rises as the ambient pressure decreases. The net effect of the increase in combustion temperature rise is a decrease in the air–fuel ratio, as observed in Fig. 12.11.

The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is largely attributed to the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure.

# 12.1.3 Trends in pressure

The compressor and turbine pressure ratios are constant during the decrease in the ambient pressure, and any fall in ambient pressure will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure will be directly proportional to the ambient pressure. Similarly, the gas generator and power turbine inlet and exit pressures also fall proportionally with the ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.4.

The trends in creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbines during the ambient pressure transient are shown in Fig. 12.5. Observe that the creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbine decreases as the ambient pressure decreases. Note from Fig. 12.3 that the power output also decreases with the decrease in ambient pressure. Therefore, the torque acting on the power turbine blades must decrease, as the power turbine speed is constant.

This reduction in torque will result in a lower total stress level on the blades, although the centrifugal stress is constant. Since the exhaust gas temperature remains constant, the lower stress levels result in a decrease in creep life usage of the power turbine.

A similar situation exists for the gas generator turbine. Because of the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the gas generator speed and the turbine entry temperature will also remain constant. Furthermore, the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor discharge temperature and hence the cooling air temperature will also remain constant. Since the airflow through the compressor decreases with the ambient pressure, the power absorbed by the compressor will also reduce. All the power required by the compressor is provided by the gas generator turbine, so the power produced by the gas generator turbine will also reduce. Although the gas generator turbine speed and temperature are constant during the ambient pressure transient, the reduced compressor power demand results in less torque in the gas generator turbine blades. The lower stresses in the gas generator turbine blades due to the lower torque requirements result in a decrease in the gas generator turbine creep life usage and can be seen in Fig. 12.5.

# 12.1.5 Trends in emissions

Figure 12.6 shows the trends in NOx, CO and CO2 emissions. Observe that the compressor discharge pressure decreases with ambient pressure, leading to a decrease in combustion pressure. The combustion temperature remains constant due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus, the decrease in combustion pressure results in a decrease in NOx emission and an increase in CO emissions. Also, the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure will contribute to the reduction in NOx.

Since the fuel flow decreases with ambient pressure, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis also decrease with reduced ambient pressure and follow the fuel flow trend. The thermal efficiency decreases slightly as discussed above.

# 12.2 Effect of ambient pressure changes on engine performance at lower power outputs

Section 12.1 considered the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance when the engine performance is constrained by an engine operating limit, as would be encountered at high-power output levels. Consider now the impact of change in the ambient pressure when the engine is operating at lower power such that no engine operating limits are encountered. The same ambient pressure transient used previously will be repeated (i.e. reducing the ambient pressure from 1.03 to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour), with the ambient temperature set to 15 degrees Celsius, and inlet and exhaust losses set to 100 mm water gauge. The generator power demand is set to 17.5 MW throughout the simulation to represent the low power case.

Since the power output of the gas turbine will be constant throughout the simulation as no engine limits are reached, the non-dimensional power, Power/(P √T), will increase as the ambient pressure P₁ decreases. Referring to Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional power with compressor non-dimensional speed, any increase in non-dimensional power must be accompanied by an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus the increase in non-dimensional speed will result in increases in other non-dimensional parameters such as pressure ratios, temperature ratios and non-dimensional flows.

# 12.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic for the low power case is shown in Fig. 12.7. The operation point is observed moving up the running line from a lower compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio to a higher compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. This is due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient pressure decreases.

# 12.2.2 Trends in speed

The ambient pressure transient results in an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ and therefore an increase in gas generator speed due to a constant ambient temperature, T₁. This is shown in Fig. 12.8, which illustrates the changes in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed during the ambient pressure transient.

It is also observed that the rate of increase in gas generator speed increases.

Dimensional speed results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, as can be observed in Fig. 11.4. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. An increase in T₃/T₁ is necessary because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

# 12.2.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Since no engine operating limits are exceeded during the ambient pressure transient, the power required by the generator will always be provided by the gas turbine. Thus the generator power output trend remains on the power demand set point. Hence, the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain essentially constant during this ambient pressure transient, as can be seen in Fig. 12.10, which shows the trends in powers and thermal efficiencies during the ambient pressure transient. The slight increase in gas power is due primarily to a small decrease in the power turbine isentropic efficiency. As the ambient pressure decreases, the exhaust gas temperature increases to maintain the generator power demand. The power turbine non-dimensional speed now decreases (note that the power turbine speed is constant), resulting in a small decrease in power turbine efficiency. Thus a

# 12.10 Trends in the power and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

The corresponding increase in gas power output occurs to maintain the power demand from the generator as observed in Fig. 12.10. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency, which represents the efficiency of the gas generator, increase as the ambient pressure decreases. As was seen in Fig. 12.9, the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ increase as the ambient pressure decreases. The thermal efficiencies essentially are functions of these ratios and independent of ambient pressure as discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the increases in the compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in increases in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas generator thermal efficiency. Therefore, when the power demand is below the maximum capacity of the engine, a low ambient pressure is desirable because it results in an increase in thermal efficiency. It is worth pointing out that this is indeed the principle of a closed cycle gas turbine where we reduce the cycle working pressure to reduce the load, thus maintaining a constant thermal efficiency at lower loads. Such closed cycle gas turbines have been built and operated as a means of overcoming the poor thermal efficiencies of gas turbines at low loads.

Such closed cycle gas turbines have been built and operated as a means of overcoming the poor thermal efficiencies of gas turbines at low loads.

# 12.11 Trends in flow during ambient pressure transient.

The compressor pressure ratio and the temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increase during the ambient pressure transient. The specific work will increase and this is due to the increase in T₃/T₁. As the power output remains constant (see Fig. 12.10), the increase in specific work will result in a decrease in compressor inlet air flow as shown in Fig. 12.11.

It is worth noting that the decrease in compressor flow, compared with the previous case, where the engine was operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit (Fig. 12.2), is smaller. This is due to the resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow and speed for this case, whereas in the previous case the compressor non-dimensional flow remained constant as the ambient pressure decreased.

The trends in the fuel flow and fuel valve position also show a decline. This is due primarily to the increased thermal efficiency. Since the power output remains constant, any increase in the thermal efficiency must result in a decrease in fuel flow, as shown in Fig. 12.11. The air–fuel ratio decreases because of the increase in T₃/T₁, as shown in Fig. 12.9. This results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the ambient temperature, T₁ is constant during this transient. Although there is an increase in the compressor discharge temperature, thus also an increase in combustion inlet temperature, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio (see Fig. 12.9), the increase in T₃ is greater, as shown in Fig. 12.12. Hence, the combustion temperature rises as the ambient pressure decreases. The net effect of the increase in combustion temperature rise is a decrease in the air–fuel ratio, as observed in Fig. 12.11.

The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is largely attributed to the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure.

# 12.1.3 Trends in pressure

The compressor and turbine pressure ratios are constant during the decrease in the ambient pressure, and any fall in ambient pressure will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure will be directly proportional to the ambient pressure. Similarly, the gas generator and power turbine inlet and exit pressures also fall proportionally with the ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.4.

# 12.1.4 Trends in creep life

The trends in creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbines during the ambient pressure transient are shown in Fig. 12.5. Observe that the creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbine decreases as the ambient pressure decreases. Note from Fig. 12.3 that the power output also decreases with the decrease in ambient pressure. Therefore, the torque acting on the power turbine blades must decrease, as the power turbine speed is constant.

This reduction in torque will result in a lower total stress level on the blades, although the centrifugal stress is constant. Since the exhaust gas temperature remains constant, the lower stress levels result in a decrease in creep life usage of the power turbine.

A similar situation exists for the gas generator turbine. Because of the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the gas generator speed and the turbine entry temperature will also remain constant. Furthermore, the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor discharge temperature and hence the cooling air temperature will also remain constant. Since the airflow through the compressor decreases with the ambient pressure, the power absorbed by the compressor will also reduce. All the power required by the compressor is provided by the gas generator turbine, so the power produced by the gas generator turbine will also reduce. Although the gas generator turbine speed and temperature are constant during the ambient pressure transient, the reduced compressor power demand results in less torque in the gas generator turbine blades. The lower stresses in the gas generator turbine blades due to the lower torque requirements result in a decrease in the gas generator turbine creep life usage and can be seen in Fig. 12.5.

# 12.1.5 Trends in emissions

Figure 12.6 shows the trends in NOx, CO and CO2 emissions. Observe that the compressor discharge pressure decreases with ambient pressure, leading to a decrease in combustion pressure. The combustion temperature remains constant due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus, the decrease in combustion pressure results in a decrease in NOx emission and an increase in CO emissions. Also, the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure will contribute to the reduction in NOx.

Since the fuel flow decreases with ambient pressure, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis also decrease with reduced ambient pressure and follow the fuel flow trend. The thermal efficiency decreases slightly as discussed above.

# 12.2 Effect of ambient pressure changes on engine performance at lower power outputs

Section 12.1 considered the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance when the engine performance is constrained by an engine operating limit, as would be encountered at high-power output levels. Consider now the impact of change in the ambient pressure when the engine is operating at lower power such that no engine operating limits are encountered. The same ambient pressure transient used previously will be repeated (i.e. reducing the ambient pressure from 1.03 to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour), with the ambient temperature set to 15 degrees Celsius, and inlet and exhaust losses set to 100 mm water gauge. The generator power demand is set to 17.5 MW throughout the simulation to represent the low power case.

Since the power output of the gas turbine will be constant throughout the simulation as no engine limits are reached, the non-dimensional power, Power/(P √T), will increase as the ambient pressure P₁ decreases. Referring to Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional power with compressor non-dimensional speed, any increase in non-dimensional power must be accompanied by an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus the increase in non-dimensional speed will result in increases in other non-dimensional parameters such as pressure ratios, temperature ratios and non-dimensional flows.

# 12.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic for the low power case is shown in Fig. 12.7. The operation point is observed moving up the running line from a lower compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio to a higher compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. This is due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient pressure decreases.

# 12.2.2 Trends in speed

The ambient pressure transient results in an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ and therefore an increase in gas generator speed due to a constant ambient temperature, T₁. This is shown in Fig. 12.8, which illustrates the changes in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed during the ambient pressure transient.

It is also observed that the rate of increase in gas generator speed increases.

Trends in pressure ratios for compressor, gas generator turbine and power turbine.

Dimensional speed results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, as can be observed in Fig. 11.4. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. An increase in T₃/T₁ is necessary because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

# 12.2.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Since no engine operating limits are exceeded during the ambient pressure transient, the power required by the generator will always be provided by the gas turbine. Thus the generator power output trend remains on the power demand set point. Hence, the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain essentially constant during this ambient pressure transient, as can be seen in Fig. 12.10, which shows the trends in powers and thermal efficiencies during the ambient pressure transient. The slight increase in gas power is due primarily to a small decrease in the power turbine isentropic efficiency. As the ambient pressure decreases, the exhaust gas temperature increases to maintain the generator power demand. The power turbine non-dimensional speed now decreases (note that the power turbine speed is constant), resulting in a small decrease in power turbine efficiency. Thus a

# 12.10 Trends in the power and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

The corresponding increase in gas power output occurs to maintain the power demand from the generator as observed in Fig. 12.10. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency, which represents the efficiency of the gas generator, increase as the ambient pressure decreases. As was seen in Fig. 12.9, the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ increase as the ambient pressure decreases. The thermal efficiencies essentially are functions of these ratios and independent of ambient pressure as discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the increases in the compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in increases in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas generator thermal efficiency. Therefore, when the power demand is below the maximum capacity of the engine, a low ambient pressure is desirable because it results in an increase in thermal efficiency. It is worth pointing out that this is indeed the principle of a closed cycle gas turbine where we reduce the cycle working pressure to reduce the load, thus maintaining a constant thermal efficiency at lower loads.

Section 12.1 considered the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance when the engine performance is constrained by an engine operating limit, as would be encountered at high-power output levels. Consider now the impact of change in the ambient pressure when the engine is operating at lower power such that no engine operating limits are encountered. The same ambient pressure transient used previously will be repeated (i.e. reducing the ambient pressure from 1.03 to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour), with the ambient temperature set to 15 degrees Celsius, and inlet and exhaust losses set to 100 mm water gauge. The generator power demand is set to 17.5 MW throughout the simulation to represent the low power case.

Since the power output of the gas turbine will be constant throughout the simulation as no engine limits are reached, the non-dimensional power, Power/(P √T), will increase as the ambient pressure P₁ decreases. Referring to Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional power with compressor non-dimensional speed, any increase in non-dimensional power must be accompanied by an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed.

# 12.10 Trends in the power and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

The corresponding increase in gas power output occurs to maintain the power demand from the generator as observed in Fig. 12.10. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency, which represents the efficiency of the gas generator, increase as the ambient pressure decreases. As was seen in Fig. 12.9, the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ increase as the ambient pressure decreases. The thermal efficiencies essentially are functions of these ratios and independent of ambient pressure as discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the increases in the compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in increases in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas generator thermal efficiency. Therefore, when the power demand is below the maximum capacity of the engine, a low ambient pressure is desirable because it results in an increase in thermal efficiency. It is worth pointing out that this is indeed the principle of a closed cycle gas turbine where we reduce the cycle working pressure to reduce the load, thus maintaining a constant thermal efficiency at lower loads. Such closed cycle gas turbines have been built and operated as a means of overcoming the poor thermal efficiencies of gas turbines at low loads.

# 12.11 Trends in flow during ambient pressure transient.

The compressor pressure ratio and the temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increase during the ambient pressure transient. The specific work will increase and this is due to the increase in T₃/T₁. As the power output remains constant (see Fig. 12.10), the increase in specific work will result in a decrease in compressor inlet air flow as shown in Fig. 12.11.

It is worth noting that the decrease in compressor flow, compared with the previous case, where the engine was operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit (Fig. 12.2), is smaller. This is due to the resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow and speed for this case, whereas in the previous case the compressor non-dimensional flow remained constant as the ambient pressure decreased.

The trends in the fuel flow and fuel valve position also show a decline. This is due primarily to the increased thermal efficiency. Since the power output remains constant, any increase in the thermal efficiency must result in a decrease in fuel flow, as shown in Fig. 12.11. The air–fuel ratio decreases because of the increase in T₃/T₁, as shown in Fig. 12.9. This results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the ambient temperature, T₁ is constant during this transient. Although there is an increase in the compressor discharge temperature, thus also an increase in combustion inlet temperature, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio (see Fig. 12.9), the increase in T₃ is greater, as shown in Fig. 12.12. Hence, the combustion temperature rises as the ambient pressure decreases. The net effect of the increase in combustion temperature rise is a decrease in the air–fuel ratio, as observed in Fig. 12.11.

The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is largely attributed to the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure.

# 12.1.3 Trends in pressure

The compressor and turbine pressure ratios are constant during the decrease in the ambient pressure, and any fall in ambient pressure will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure will be directly proportional to the ambient pressure. Similarly, the gas generator and power turbine inlet and exit pressures also fall proportionally with the ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.4.

# 12.1.4 Trends in creep life

The trends in creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbines during the ambient pressure transient are shown in Fig. 12.5. Observe that the creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbine decreases as the ambient pressure decreases. Note from Fig. 12.3 that the power output also decreases with the decrease in ambient pressure. Therefore, the torque acting on the power turbine blades must decrease, as the power turbine speed is constant.

This reduction in torque will result in a lower total stress level on the blades, although the centrifugal stress is constant. Since the exhaust gas temperature remains constant, the lower stress levels result in a decrease in creep life usage of the power turbine.

A similar situation exists for the gas generator turbine. Because of the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the gas generator speed and the turbine entry temperature will also remain constant. Furthermore, the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor discharge temperature and hence the cooling air temperature will also remain constant. Since the airflow through the compressor decreases with the ambient pressure, the power absorbed by the compressor will also reduce. All the power required by the compressor is provided by the gas generator turbine, so the power produced by the gas generator turbine will also reduce. Although the gas generator turbine speed and temperature are constant during the ambient pressure transient, the reduced compressor power demand results in less torque in the gas generator turbine blades. The lower stresses in the gas generator turbine blades due to the lower torque requirements result in a decrease in the gas generator turbine creep life usage and can be seen in Fig. 12.5.

# 12.1.5 Trends in emissions

Figure 12.6 shows the trends in NOx, CO and CO2 emissions. Observe that the compressor discharge pressure decreases with ambient pressure, leading to a decrease in combustion pressure. The combustion temperature remains constant due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus, the decrease in combustion pressure results in a decrease in NOx emission and an increase in CO emissions. Also, the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure will contribute to the reduction in NOx.

Since the fuel flow decreases with ambient pressure, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis also decrease with reduced ambient pressure and follow the fuel flow trend. The thermal efficiency decreases slightly as discussed above.

# 12.2 Effect of ambient pressure changes on engine performance at lower power outputs

Section 12.1 considered the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance when the engine performance is constrained by an engine operating limit, as would be encountered at high-power output levels. Consider now the impact of change in the ambient pressure when the engine is operating at lower power such that no engine operating limits are encountered. The same ambient pressure transient used previously will be repeated (i.e. reducing the ambient pressure from 1.03 to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour), with the ambient temperature set to 15 degrees Celsius, and inlet and exhaust losses set to 100 mm water gauge. The generator power demand is set to 17.5 MW throughout the simulation to represent the low power case.

Since the power output of the gas turbine will be constant throughout the simulation as no engine limits are reached, the non-dimensional power, Power/(P √T), will increase as the ambient pressure P₁ decreases. Referring to Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional power with compressor non-dimensional speed, any increase in non-dimensional power must be accompanied by an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus the increase in non-dimensional speed will result in increases in other non-dimensional parameters such as pressure ratios, temperature ratios and non-dimensional flows.

# 12.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic for the low power case is shown in Fig. 12.7. The operation point is observed moving up the running line from a lower compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio to a higher compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. This is due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient pressure decreases.

# 12.2.2 Trends in speed

The ambient pressure transient results in an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ and therefore an increase in gas generator speed due to a constant ambient temperature, T₁. This is shown in Fig. 12.8, which illustrates the changes in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed during the ambient pressure transient.

It is also observed that the rate of increase in gas generator speed increases.

Dimensional speed results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, as can be observed in Fig. 11.4. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. An increase in T₃/T₁ is necessary because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

# 12.2.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Since no engine operating limits are exceeded during the ambient pressure transient, the power required by the generator will always be provided by the gas turbine. Thus the generator power output trend remains on the power demand set point. Hence, the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain essentially constant during this ambient pressure transient, as can be seen in Fig. 12.10, which shows the trends in powers and thermal efficiencies during the ambient pressure transient. The slight increase in gas power is due primarily to a small decrease in the power turbine isentropic efficiency. As the ambient pressure decreases, the exhaust gas temperature increases to maintain the generator power demand. The power turbine non-dimensional speed now decreases (note that the power turbine speed is constant), resulting in a small decrease in power turbine efficiency. Thus a

Trends in pressure ratios for compressor, gas generator turbine and power turbine.

Dimensional speed results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, as can be observed in Fig. 11.4. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. An increase in T₃/T₁ is necessary because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

# 12.2.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Since no engine operating limits are exceeded during the ambient pressure transient, the power required by the generator will always be provided by the gas turbine. Thus the generator power output trend remains on the power demand set point. Hence, the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain essentially constant during this ambient pressure transient, as can be seen in Fig. 12.10, which shows the trends in powers and thermal efficiencies during the ambient pressure transient. The slight increase in gas power is due primarily to a small decrease in the power turbine isentropic efficiency. As the ambient pressure decreases, the exhaust gas temperature increases to maintain the generator power demand. The power turbine non-dimensional speed now decreases (note that the power turbine speed is constant), resulting in a small decrease in power turbine efficiency. Thus a

# 12.10 Trends in the power and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

The corresponding increase in gas power output occurs to maintain the power demand from the generator as observed in Fig. 12.10. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency, which represents the efficiency of the gas generator, increase as the ambient pressure decreases. As was seen in Fig. 12.9, the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ increase as the ambient pressure decreases. The thermal efficiencies essentially are functions of these ratios and independent of ambient pressure as discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the increases in the compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in increases in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas generator thermal efficiency. Therefore, when the power demand is below the maximum capacity of the engine, a low ambient pressure is desirable because it results in an increase in thermal efficiency. It is worth pointing out that this is indeed the principle of a closed cycle gas turbine where we reduce the cycle working pressure to reduce the load, thus maintaining a constant thermal efficiency at lower loads. Such closed cycle gas turbines have been built and operated as a means of overcoming the poor thermal efficiencies of gas turbines at low loads.

# 12.11 Trends in flow during ambient pressure transient.

The compressor pressure ratio and the temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increase during the ambient pressure transient. The specific work will increase and this is due to the increase in T₃/T₁. As the power output remains constant (see Fig. 12.10), the increase in specific work will result in a decrease in compressor inlet air flow as shown in Fig. 12.11.

It is worth noting that the decrease in compressor flow, compared with the previous case, where the engine was operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit (Fig. 12.2), is smaller. This is due to the resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow and speed for this case, whereas in the previous case the compressor non-dimensional flow remained constant as the ambient pressure decreased.

The trends in the fuel flow and fuel valve position also show a decline. This is due primarily to the increased thermal efficiency. Since the power output remains constant, any increase in the thermal efficiency must result in a decrease in fuel flow, as shown in Fig. 12.11. The air–fuel ratio decreases because of the increase in T₃/T₁, as shown in Fig. 12.9. This results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the ambient temperature, T₁ is constant during this transient. Although there is an increase in the compressor discharge temperature, thus also an increase in combustion inlet temperature, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio (see Fig. 12.9), the increase in T₃ is greater, as shown in Fig. 12.12. Hence, the combustion temperature rises as the ambient pressure decreases. The net effect of the increase in combustion temperature rise is a decrease in the air–fuel ratio, as observed in Fig. 12.11.

The slight decrease in thermal efficiency is largely attributed to the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure.

# 12.1.3 Trends in pressure

The compressor and turbine pressure ratios are constant during the decrease in the ambient pressure, and any fall in ambient pressure will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in the compressor discharge pressure will be directly proportional to the ambient pressure. Similarly, the gas generator and power turbine inlet and exit pressures also fall proportionally with the ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.4.

The trends in creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbines during the ambient pressure transient are shown in Fig. 12.5. Observe that the creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbine decreases as the ambient pressure decreases. Note from Fig. 12.3 that the power output also decreases with the decrease in ambient pressure. Therefore, the torque acting on the power turbine blades must decrease, as the power turbine speed is constant.

This reduction in torque will result in a lower total stress level on the blades, although the centrifugal stress is constant. Since the exhaust gas temperature remains constant, the lower stress levels result in a decrease in creep life usage of the power turbine.

A similar situation exists for the gas generator turbine. Because of the constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the gas generator speed and the turbine entry temperature will also remain constant. Furthermore, the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor discharge temperature and hence the cooling air temperature will also remain constant. Since the airflow through the compressor decreases with the ambient pressure, the power absorbed by the compressor will also reduce. All the power required by the compressor is provided by the gas generator turbine, so the power produced by the gas generator turbine will also reduce. Although the gas generator turbine speed and temperature are constant during the ambient pressure transient, the reduced compressor power demand results in less torque in the gas generator turbine blades. The lower stresses in the gas generator turbine blades due to the lower torque requirements result in a decrease in the gas generator turbine creep life usage and can be seen in Fig. 12.5.

# 12.1.5 Trends in emissions

Figure 12.6 shows the trends in NOx, CO and CO2 emissions. Observe that the compressor discharge pressure decreases with ambient pressure, leading to a decrease in combustion pressure. The combustion temperature remains constant due to the constant compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus, the decrease in combustion pressure results in a decrease in NOx emission and an increase in CO emissions. Also, the increase in specific humidity due to the decrease in ambient pressure will contribute to the reduction in NOx.

Since the fuel flow decreases with ambient pressure, the CO2 emissions on a mass basis also decrease with reduced ambient pressure and follow the fuel flow trend. The thermal efficiency decreases slightly as discussed above.

# 12.2 Effect of ambient pressure changes on engine performance at lower power outputs

Section 12.1 considered the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance when the engine performance is constrained by an engine operating limit, as would be encountered at high-power output levels. Consider now the impact of change in the ambient pressure when the engine is operating at lower power such that no engine operating limits are encountered. The same ambient pressure transient used previously will be repeated (i.e. reducing the ambient pressure from 1.03 to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour), with the ambient temperature set to 15 degrees Celsius, and inlet and exhaust losses set to 100 mm water gauge. The generator power demand is set to 17.5 MW throughout the simulation to represent the low power case.

Since the power output of the gas turbine will be constant throughout the simulation as no engine limits are reached, the non-dimensional power, Power/(P √T), will increase as the ambient pressure P₁ decreases. Referring to Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional power with compressor non-dimensional speed, any increase in non-dimensional power must be accompanied by an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus the increase in non-dimensional speed will result in increases in other non-dimensional parameters such as pressure ratios, temperature ratios and non-dimensional flows.

# 12.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The operating point on the compressor characteristic for the low power case is shown in Fig. 12.7. The operation point is observed moving up the running line from a lower compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio to a higher compressor non-dimensional flow and pressure ratio. This is due to the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed as the ambient pressure decreases.

# 12.2.2 Trends in speed

The ambient pressure transient results in an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ and therefore an increase in gas generator speed due to a constant ambient temperature, T₁. This is shown in Fig. 12.8, which illustrates the changes in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speed during the ambient pressure transient.

It is also observed that the rate of increase in gas generator speed increases.

as the ambient pressure falls. This is due to higher compressor non-dimensional speeds forcing the compressor to operate closer to compressor inlet choke conditions. Note that the speeds do not reach or exceed any limiting values during this transient.

Trends in pressure ratios for compressor, gas generator turbine and power turbine.

Dimensional speed results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, as can be observed in Fig. 11.4. The gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio results in an increase in the power turbine pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. An increase in T₃/T₁ is necessary because of the increase in compressor non-dimensional speed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

# 12.2.4 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Since no engine operating limits are exceeded during the ambient pressure transient, the power required by the generator will always be provided by the gas turbine. Thus the generator power output trend remains on the power demand set point. Hence, the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain essentially constant during this ambient pressure transient, as can be seen in Fig. 12.10, which shows the trends in powers and thermal efficiencies during the ambient pressure transient. The slight increase in gas power is due primarily to a small decrease in the power turbine isentropic efficiency. As the ambient pressure decreases, the exhaust gas temperature increases to maintain the generator power demand. The power turbine non-dimensional speed now decreases (note that the power turbine speed is constant), resulting in a small decrease in power turbine efficiency. Thus a

# 12.10 Trends in the power and thermal efficiency during ambient pressure transient.

The corresponding increase in gas power output occurs to maintain the power demand from the generator as observed in Fig. 12.10. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency, which represents the efficiency of the gas generator, increase as the ambient pressure decreases. As was seen in Fig. 12.9, the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ increase as the ambient pressure decreases. The thermal efficiencies essentially are functions of these ratios and independent of ambient pressure as discussed in Chapter 2. Thus the increases in the compressor pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, result in increases in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas generator thermal efficiency. Therefore, when the power demand is below the maximum capacity of the engine, a low ambient pressure is desirable because it results in an increase in thermal efficiency. It is worth pointing out that this is indeed the principle of a closed cycle gas turbine where we reduce the cycle working pressure to reduce the load, thus maintaining a constant thermal efficiency at lower loads. Such closed cycle gas turbines have been built and operated as a means of overcoming the poor thermal efficiencies of gas turbines at low loads.

# 12.11 Trends in flow during ambient pressure transient.

The compressor pressure ratio and the temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increase during the ambient pressure transient. The specific work will increase and this is due to the increase in T₃/T₁. As the power output remains constant (see Fig. 12.10), the increase in specific work will result in a decrease in compressor inlet air flow as shown in Fig. 12.11.

It is worth noting that the decrease in compressor flow, compared with the previous case, where the engine was operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit (Fig. 12.2), is smaller. This is due to the resultant increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow and speed for this case, whereas in the previous case the compressor non-dimensional flow remained constant as the ambient pressure decreased.

The trends in the fuel flow and fuel valve position also show a decline. This is due primarily to the increased thermal efficiency. Since the power output remains constant, any increase in the thermal efficiency must result in a decrease in fuel flow, as shown in Fig. 12.11. The air–fuel ratio decreases because of the increase in T₃/T₁, as shown in Fig. 12.9. This results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the ambient temperature, T₁ is constant during this transient. Although there is an increase in the compressor discharge temperature, thus also an increase in combustion inlet temperature, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio (see Fig. 12.9), the increase in T₃ is greater, as shown in Fig. 12.12. Hence, the combustion temperature rises as the ambient pressure decreases. The net effect of the increase in combustion temperature rise is a decrease in the air–fuel ratio, as observed in Fig. 12.11.
