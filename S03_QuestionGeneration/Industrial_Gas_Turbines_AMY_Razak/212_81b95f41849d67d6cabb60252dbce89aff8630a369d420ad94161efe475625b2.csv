As ambient pressure decreases, the compressor discharge pressure also decreases, which results in a reduction in torque acting on the turbine blades while the turbine speed remains constant. This reduction in torque leads to lower total stress levels on the blades, although the centrifugal stress remains constant.

For the power turbine, the lower stress levels due to reduced torque result in a decrease in creep life usage. Similarly, for the gas generator turbine, the constant compressor non-dimensional speed means that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature remain unchanged. However, the reduced power demand from the compressor due to lower ambient pressure results in less torque on the gas generator turbine blades, which also leads to a decrease in creep life usage.

Overall, the trends indicate that as ambient pressure decreases, both turbines experience reduced creep life usage due to lower torque and stress levels."

1. **Constant Power Output**: When the engine operates at lower power outputs, the power output remains constant despite changes in ambient pressure. This is because no engine operating limits are encountered at these lower power levels.

2. **Increase in Non-Dimensional Power**: As ambient pressure decreases, the non-dimensional power (Power/(P √T)) increases. This indicates that the gas turbine can maintain its output efficiency even as environmental conditions change.

3. **Compressor Non-Dimensional Speed**: The increase in non-dimensional power necessitates an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed.

During ambient pressure transients, as the ambient pressure decreases, the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. This increase in non-dimensional speed moves the operating point of the compressor up the running line, which is the region of stable operation, towards higher non-dimensional flow and pressure ratios.

As the compressor non-dimensional speed approaches the surge line, it is crucial to monitor the operating point to ensure it remains within the stable region. If the non-dimensional speed falls below the surge line, the compressor may experience surge, leading to unstable operation. Therefore, during ambient pressure transients, maintaining a non-dimensional speed above the surge line is essential for stable compressor performance."

1. **Constant Power Output**: In the scenario described, the power output of the gas turbine remains constant despite the decrease in ambient pressure. This leads to an increase in non-dimensional power, which is defined as Power/(P √T). As ambient pressure (P₁) decreases, the non-dimensional power increases.

2. **Compressor Non-Dimensional Speed**: To accommodate the increase in non-dimensional power, the compressor non-dimensional speed must also increase. This is a direct relationship where any rise in non-dimensional power necessitates a corresponding rise in compressor non-dimensional speed.

3. **Changes in Other Non-Dimensional Parameters**: The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is associated with increases in other non-dimensional parameters, such as pressure ratios, temperature ratios, and non-dimensional flows. These changes are interconnected and contribute to the overall performance of the compressor.

4. **Ambient Conditions**: The ambient pressure decrease results in changes in combustion pressure and fuel flow, which indirectly affect the operational characteristics of the compressor, leading to adjustments in its speed.
