From Fig. 4.4, it is evident that V′/V is less than V₂/V₁ and therefore an increase in diffusion will occur due to an increase in deflection. The amount of diffusion must be controlled, as high diffusion will result in increased losses in the stage resulting in lower stage efficiency. A design parameter employed to limit the amount of diffusion is the de Haller number, which is simply the ratio of V₂/V₁. Experience has shown that, for acceptable losses, the de Haller number must not be less than 0.72. Also note an increase in tangential or ‘whirl’ velocity and therefore an increase in stage work input will occur with increased deflection. ",How is diffusion defined in the context of the text?,Diffusion is defined as the ratio of V₂ to V₁.,"In the text, diffusion refers to the ratio between V₂ and V₁.",The text defines diffusion as V₂ divided by V₁.,"Diffusion, according to the text, is calculated by the ratio V₂/V₁.",The definition provided in the text for diffusion is the ratio of V₂ over V₁.
