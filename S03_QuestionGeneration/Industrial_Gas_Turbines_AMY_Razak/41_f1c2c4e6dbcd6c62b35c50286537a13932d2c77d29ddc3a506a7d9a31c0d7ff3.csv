# 3 Complex gas turbine cycle

In Chapter 2 the design point performance of the simple cycle gas turbine, which consists of a compressor, combustor and turbine, was considered. Although the inclusion of a heat exchanger (referred to as the regenerative cycle) was also considered, it is the addition of intercooling to reduce the compressor work, and reheat to augment the turbine work, that are usually referred to as complex cycles. In this chapter the design point performance of such cycles, including the addition of a heat exchanger, will be considered.

# 3.1 Intercooled gas turbine cycles

When the performance of the simple and regenerative cycle gas turbine was considered, it was assumed that the compression process was isentropic. The compression work required by these cycles may be reduced by dividing the compression process into two stages. These comprise the LP and the HP stages as shown in Fig. 3.1, and also cooling to reduce the LP compressor discharge air temperature, T₂, back to its inlet temperature (i.e. reducing T₃ to T₁). It was shown in Chapter 2 that the compressor-specific work requirement to achieve a given pressure ratio is given by:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1)

which, for an isentropic process, can be expressed as

|Intercooler|Fuel input|6| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|4|5|1–2 Low pressure (LP) compression| |
| |Combustor| | |2–3 Intercooling| |3–4 High pressure (HP) compression|
|LP|HP| |Load|4–5 Heat addition| |5–6 Expansion|
| |Compressors| | | | | |

3.1 Schematic representation of an intercooled gas turbine.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Wcomp = cp T1 ((Pr)γ – 1)

Therefore, reducing T1 will reduce the compressor work required to achieve a given compressor pressure ratio, Pr. Thus, intercooling results in a reduction in the compressor work requirement of the HP compressor and hence reduces the overall compression work required to achieve a given overall compressor pressure ratio, P4/P1.

# 3.1.1 Optimisation of intercooled compressors

The optimisation of an intercooled compressor involves the determination of the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios such that the compression power required is a minimum. If the LP compressor pressure ratio is unity or equal to the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1, then no reduction in compressor work absorbed will occur. The question that arises is ‘what LP compressor pressure ratio will result in the minimum compressor work absorbed’. The compression process for intercooled compressors is shown on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 3.2 for an arbitrary value for the LP compressor ratio, Prlp.

The HP pressure ratio, Prhp, will then be given by Pro/Prlp, where Pro is the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1. The compression work, Wcomp, is therefore:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T3)

Since T3 = T1 due to intercooling

Wcomp = cp[(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T1)] [3.1]

Equation 3.1 can be represented in terms of the LP and overall pressure ratio as:

Wcomp = cT ⎛       γ –1  ⌈ Pr    ⌉γγ–1   ⎜
(Prlp)γ +    o           ⎝
⎛             ⎜   lp  ⎝       ⎝
⎜

Differentiating Equation 3.2 with respect to Prlp and equating to zero gives:

Prlp =   Pro                                                     [3.3]

By considering the second derivative of Equation 3.2, it can be shown that the condition expressed in Equation 3.3 is a minimum. Therefore, the minimum work absorbed by an intercooled compression system occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal.

# 3.1.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal intercooled gas turbine

The intercooled gas turbine shown in Fig. 3.1 may be represented on the temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.3. Since we are considering the ideal performance of the cycle, the thermodynamic processes involved are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat rejection
- 3–4 isentropic compression
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

In fact, it may be considered that an ideal intercooled gas turbine cycle consists of two ideal simple cycle gas turbines (2–3–4–4′ and 1–4′–5–6), as shown in Fig. 3.3. The increased specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is due to the specific work of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine 2–3–4–4′.

The smaller gas turbine cycle requires an additional heat input which corresponds to the heat input from 4–4′. However, the pressure ratio of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine, P4/P3, is less than the pressure ratio of the larger simple cycle gas turbine 1–4′–5–6. Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of the smaller ideal gas turbine cycle is less than that of the larger gas turbine cycle. In effect, a less efficient gas turbine cycle has been added to a more efficient cycle. Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle is less than that of the simple cycle gas turbine whose overall pressure ratios are the same as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

Furthermore, for a given minimum cycle temperature, T1, increasing the maximum cycle temperature, T5, increases the specific work of the larger.

Since the ideal thermal efficiency of the larger gas turbine is greater than the smaller gas turbine, the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled gas turbine cycle will increase with increase in the maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

# 64 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle increases with an increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, and this differs from the case of the simple gas turbine cycle, where the ideal thermal efficiency is independent of this temperature ratio. Of course, the specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is higher than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 3.5. As was found with the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the specific work of the ideal intercooled gas turbine is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Fig. 3.5. It is additionally observed that the maximum specific work occurs at a higher pressure ratio compared with the simple cycle gas turbine.

# 3.1.3 Practical intercooled cycle

The ideal intercooled cycle considers only isentropic compression and expansion processes and ignores any pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes. In a practical cycle, such assumptions are never achieved and the effect of irreversibilities discussed in Chapter 2 results in a significant loss in thermal efficiency and specific work. Furthermore, the conclusion that an ideal intercooled cycle always results in a lower thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine may not hold.

This is illustrated by considering the case discussed in Section 2.9 where the impact of irreversibilities on the performance of the simple cycle gas turbine was investigated. In particular, the case where the maximum cycle temperature was increased sufficiently so that the turbine expansion work.

was equal to the compressor absorbed work will be considered. Since a finite amount of heat was supplied, the thermal efficiency was zero. If the compression process is intercooled, the reduction in compressor specific work will now result in a finite specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle, i.e. the turbine work remains the same, while the compression work decreases.

Although the heat input has now increased to maintain the same maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.6, the positive specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle will result in a positive thermal efficiency. Thus, when irreversibilities are considered, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. The optimisation of a practical intercooled gas turbine for maximum thermal efficiency may not result in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios being equal and generally the LP compressor pressure ratio will be much less than the optimum value for minimum compression work.

Optimisation of the split in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios can therefore achieve a worthwhile increase in the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. This point is illustrated in Fig. 3.7 where the optimised intercooled gas turbine thermal efficiency is plotted against specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios, Pr, and maximum cycle temperatures, T₅. Thermal efficiencies of the order of 45% are possible with intercooling and one major manufacturer is seriously considering the manufacture of such gas turbines. 1 A discussion of the benefits is given in Modern Power Systems.2 The optimised LP compressor pressure ratios are shown in Fig. ","What are the main components of a simple cycle gas turbine as described in the book 'Hydrocarbon Fuels' by Goodger, E.M.?","The main components are a compressor, combustor, and turbine.","According to 'Hydrocarbon Fuels', a simple cycle gas turbine consists of three primary parts: compressor, combustor, and turbine.","In 'Hydrocarbon Fuels', Goodger, E.M. mentions that the simple cycle gas turbine includes a compressor for air compression, a combustor for fuel combustion, and a turbine for power generation.","The book 'Hydrocarbon Fuels' outlines that the simple cycle gas turbine is made up of a compressor, a combustor where the fuel is burned, and a turbine that expands the hot gases to produce work.","Goodger, E.M. in 'Hydrocarbon Fuels' describes the simple cycle gas turbine as comprising a compressor to pressurize air, a combustor to mix and burn fuel with the compressed air, and a turbine to convert the energy of the hot gases into mechanical energy."

Therefore, reducing T1 will reduce the compressor work required to achieve a given compressor pressure ratio, Pr. Thus, intercooling results in a reduction in the compressor work requirement of the HP compressor and hence reduces the overall compression work required to achieve a given overall compressor pressure ratio, P4/P1.

By considering the second derivative of Equation 3.2, it can be shown that the condition expressed in Equation 3.3 is a minimum. Therefore, the minimum work absorbed by an intercooled compression system occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal.

If the compression process is intercooled, the reduction in compressor specific work will now result in a finite specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle, i.e. the turbine work remains the same, while the compression work decreases.

Although the heat input has now increased to maintain the same maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.6, the positive specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle will result in a positive thermal efficiency. Thus, when irreversibilities are considered, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. The optimisation of a practical intercooled gas turbine for maximum thermal efficiency may not result in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios being equal and generally the LP compressor pressure ratio will be much less than the optimum value for minimum compression work.

Optimisation of the split in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios can therefore achieve a worthwhile increase in the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. This point is illustrated in Fig. 3.7 where the optimised intercooled gas turbine thermal efficiency is plotted against specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios, Pr, and maximum cycle temperatures, T₅.

# 3 Complex gas turbine cycle

In Chapter 2 the design point performance of the simple cycle gas turbine, which consists of a compressor, combustor and turbine, was considered. Although the inclusion of a heat exchanger (referred to as the regenerative cycle) was also considered, it is the addition of intercooling to reduce the compressor work, and reheat to augment the turbine work, that are usually referred to as complex cycles. In this chapter the design point performance of such cycles, including the addition of a heat exchanger, will be considered.

# 3.1 Intercooled gas turbine cycles

When the performance of the simple and regenerative cycle gas turbine was considered, it was assumed that the compression process was isentropic. The compression work required by these cycles may be reduced by dividing the compression process into two stages. These comprise the LP and the HP stages as shown in Fig. 3.1, and also cooling to reduce the LP compressor discharge air temperature, T₂, back to its inlet temperature (i.e. reducing T₃ to T₁). It was shown in Chapter 2 that the compressor-specific work requirement to achieve a given pressure ratio is given by:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1)

which, for an isentropic process, can be expressed as

|Intercooler|Fuel input|6| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|4|5|1–2 Low pressure (LP) compression| |
| |Combustor| | |2–3 Intercooling| |3–4 High pressure (HP) compression|
|LP|HP| |Load|4–5 Heat addition| |5–6 Expansion|
| |Compressors| | | | | |

3.1 Schematic representation of an intercooled gas turbine.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Wcomp = cp T1 ((Pr)γ – 1)

Therefore, reducing T1 will reduce the compressor work required to achieve a given compressor pressure ratio, Pr. Thus, intercooling results in a reduction in the compressor work requirement of the HP compressor and hence reduces the overall compression work required to achieve a given overall compressor pressure ratio, P4/P1.

# 3.1.1 Optimisation of intercooled compressors

The optimisation of an intercooled compressor involves the determination of the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios such that the compression power required is a minimum. If the LP compressor pressure ratio is unity or equal to the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1, then no reduction in compressor work absorbed will occur. The question that arises is ‘what LP compressor pressure ratio will result in the minimum compressor work absorbed’. The compression process for intercooled compressors is shown on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 3.2 for an arbitrary value for the LP compressor ratio, Prlp.

The HP pressure ratio, Prhp, will then be given by Pro/Prlp, where Pro is the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1. The compression work, Wcomp, is therefore:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T3)

Since T3 = T1 due to intercooling

Wcomp = cp[(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T1)] [3.1]

2–3 Constant pressure heat rejection (intercooling)

Equation 3.1 can be represented in terms of the LP and overall pressure ratio as:

Wcomp = cT ⎛       γ –1  ⌈ Pr    ⌉γγ–1   ⎜
(Prlp)γ +    o           ⎝
⎛             ⎜   lp  ⎝       ⎝
⎜

Differentiating Equation 3.2 with respect to Prlp and equating to zero gives:

Prlp =   Pro                                                     [3.3]

By considering the second derivative of Equation 3.2, it can be shown that the condition expressed in Equation 3.3 is a minimum. Therefore, the minimum work absorbed by an intercooled compression system occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal.

# 3.1.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal intercooled gas turbine

The intercooled gas turbine shown in Fig. 3.1 may be represented on the temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.3. Since we are considering the ideal performance of the cycle, the thermodynamic processes involved are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat rejection
- 3–4 isentropic compression
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

In fact, it may be considered that an ideal intercooled gas turbine cycle consists of two ideal simple cycle gas turbines (2–3–4–4′ and 1–4′–5–6), as shown in Fig. 3.3. The increased specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is due to the specific work of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine 2–3–4–4′.

The smaller gas turbine cycle requires an additional heat input which corresponds to the heat input from 4–4′. However, the pressure ratio of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine, P4/P3, is less than the pressure ratio of the larger simple cycle gas turbine 1–4′–5–6. Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of the smaller ideal gas turbine cycle is less than that of the larger gas turbine cycle. In effect, a less efficient gas turbine cycle has been added to a more efficient cycle. Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle is less than that of the simple cycle gas turbine whose overall pressure ratios are the same as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

Furthermore, for a given minimum cycle temperature, T1, increasing the maximum cycle temperature, T5, increases the specific work of the larger.

Since the ideal thermal efficiency of the larger gas turbine is greater than the smaller gas turbine, the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled gas turbine cycle will increase with increase in the maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

# 64 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle increases with an increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, and this differs from the case of the simple gas turbine cycle, where the ideal thermal efficiency is independent of this temperature ratio. Of course, the specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is higher than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 3.5. As was found with the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the specific work of the ideal intercooled gas turbine is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Fig. 3.5. It is additionally observed that the maximum specific work occurs at a higher pressure ratio compared with the simple cycle gas turbine.

# 3.1.3 Practical intercooled cycle

The ideal intercooled cycle considers only isentropic compression and expansion processes and ignores any pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes. In a practical cycle, such assumptions are never achieved and the effect of irreversibilities discussed in Chapter 2 results in a significant loss in thermal efficiency and specific work. Furthermore, the conclusion that an ideal intercooled cycle always results in a lower thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine may not hold.

This is illustrated by considering the case discussed in Section 2.9 where the impact of irreversibilities on the performance of the simple cycle gas turbine was investigated. In particular, the case where the maximum cycle temperature was increased sufficiently so that the turbine expansion work.

Since the ideal thermal efficiency of the larger gas turbine is greater than the smaller gas turbine, the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled gas turbine cycle will increase with increase in the maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

# 64 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle increases with an increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, and this differs from the case of the simple gas turbine cycle, where the ideal thermal efficiency is independent of this temperature ratio. Of course, the specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is higher than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 3.5. As was found with the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the specific work of the ideal intercooled gas turbine is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Fig. 3.5. It is additionally observed that the maximum specific work occurs at a higher pressure ratio compared with the simple cycle gas turbine.

# 3.1.3 Practical intercooled cycle

The ideal intercooled cycle considers only isentropic compression and expansion processes and ignores any pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes. In a practical cycle, such assumptions are never achieved and the effect of irreversibilities discussed in Chapter 2 results in a significant loss in thermal efficiency and specific work. Furthermore, the conclusion that an ideal intercooled cycle always results in a lower thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine may not hold.

This is illustrated by considering the case discussed in Section 2.9 where the impact of irreversibilities on the performance of the simple cycle gas turbine was investigated. In particular, the case where the maximum cycle temperature was increased sufficiently so that the turbine expansion work.

If the compression process is intercooled, the reduction in compressor specific work will now result in a finite specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle, i.e. the turbine work remains the same, while the compression work decreases.

Although the heat input has now increased to maintain the same maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.6, the positive specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle will result in a positive thermal efficiency. Thus, when irreversibilities are considered, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. The optimisation of a practical intercooled gas turbine for maximum thermal efficiency may not result in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios being equal and generally the LP compressor pressure ratio will be much less than the optimum value for minimum compression work.

Optimisation of the split in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios can therefore achieve a worthwhile increase in the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. This point is illustrated in Fig. 3.7 where the optimised intercooled gas turbine thermal efficiency is plotted against specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios, Pr, and maximum cycle temperatures, T₅.

# 3 Complex gas turbine cycle

In Chapter 2 the design point performance of the simple cycle gas turbine, which consists of a compressor, combustor and turbine, was considered. Although the inclusion of a heat exchanger (referred to as the regenerative cycle) was also considered, it is the addition of intercooling to reduce the compressor work, and reheat to augment the turbine work, that are usually referred to as complex cycles. In this chapter the design point performance of such cycles, including the addition of a heat exchanger, will be considered.

# 3.1 Intercooled gas turbine cycles

When the performance of the simple and regenerative cycle gas turbine was considered, it was assumed that the compression process was isentropic. The compression work required by these cycles may be reduced by dividing the compression process into two stages. These comprise the LP and the HP stages as shown in Fig. 3.1, and also cooling to reduce the LP compressor discharge air temperature, T₂, back to its inlet temperature (i.e. reducing T₃ to T₁). It was shown in Chapter 2 that the compressor-specific work requirement to achieve a given pressure ratio is given by:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1)

which, for an isentropic process, can be expressed as

|Intercooler|Fuel input|6| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|4|5|1–2 Low pressure (LP) compression| |
| |Combustor| | |2–3 Intercooling| |3–4 High pressure (HP) compression|
|LP|HP| |Load|4–5 Heat addition| |5–6 Expansion|
| |Compressors| | | | | |

3.1 Schematic representation of an intercooled gas turbine.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Wcomp = cp T1 ((Pr)γ – 1)

Therefore, reducing T1 will reduce the compressor work required to achieve a given compressor pressure ratio, Pr. Thus, intercooling results in a reduction in the compressor work requirement of the HP compressor and hence reduces the overall compression work required to achieve a given overall compressor pressure ratio, P4/P1.

# 3.1.1 Optimisation of intercooled compressors

The optimisation of an intercooled compressor involves the determination of the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios such that the compression power required is a minimum. If the LP compressor pressure ratio is unity or equal to the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1, then no reduction in compressor work absorbed will occur. The question that arises is ‘what LP compressor pressure ratio will result in the minimum compressor work absorbed’. The compression process for intercooled compressors is shown on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 3.2 for an arbitrary value for the LP compressor ratio, Prlp.

The HP pressure ratio, Prhp, will then be given by Pro/Prlp, where Pro is the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1. The compression work, Wcomp, is therefore:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T3)

Since T3 = T1 due to intercooling

Wcomp = cp[(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T1)] [3.1]

Equation 3.1 can be represented in terms of the LP and overall pressure ratio as:

Wcomp = cT ⎛       γ –1  ⌈ Pr    ⌉γγ–1   ⎜
(Prlp)γ +    o           ⎝
⎛             ⎜   lp  ⎝       ⎝
⎜

Differentiating Equation 3.2 with respect to Prlp and equating to zero gives:

Prlp =   Pro                                                     [3.3]

By considering the second derivative of Equation 3.2, it can be shown that the condition expressed in Equation 3.3 is a minimum. Therefore, the minimum work absorbed by an intercooled compression system occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal.

# 3.1.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal intercooled gas turbine

The intercooled gas turbine shown in Fig. 3.1 may be represented on the temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.3. Since we are considering the ideal performance of the cycle, the thermodynamic processes involved are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat rejection
- 3–4 isentropic compression
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

In fact, it may be considered that an ideal intercooled gas turbine cycle consists of two ideal simple cycle gas turbines (2–3–4–4′ and 1–4′–5–6), as shown in Fig. 3.3. The increased specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is due to the specific work of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine 2–3–4–4′.

The smaller gas turbine cycle requires an additional heat input which corresponds to the heat input from 4–4′. However, the pressure ratio of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine, P4/P3, is less than the pressure ratio of the larger simple cycle gas turbine 1–4′–5–6. Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of the smaller ideal gas turbine cycle is less than that of the larger gas turbine cycle. In effect, a less efficient gas turbine cycle has been added to a more efficient cycle. Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle is less than that of the simple cycle gas turbine whose overall pressure ratios are the same as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

Furthermore, for a given minimum cycle temperature, T1, increasing the maximum cycle temperature, T5, increases the specific work of the larger.

Prlp =   Pro                                                     [3.3]

By considering the second derivative of Equation 3.2, it can be shown that the condition expressed in Equation 3.3 is a minimum. Therefore, the minimum work absorbed by an intercooled compression system occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal.

# 3.1.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal intercooled gas turbine

The intercooled gas turbine shown in Fig. 3.1 may be represented on the temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.3. Since we are considering the ideal performance of the cycle, the thermodynamic processes involved are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat rejection
- 3–4 isentropic compression
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

In fact, it may be considered that an ideal intercooled gas turbine cycle consists of two ideal simple cycle gas turbines (2–3–4–4′ and 1–4′–5–6), as shown in Fig. 3.3. The increased specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is due to the specific work of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine 2–3–4–4′.

The smaller gas turbine cycle requires an additional heat input which corresponds to the heat input from 4–4′. However, the pressure ratio of the smaller simple cycle gas turbine, P4/P3, is less than the pressure ratio of the larger simple cycle gas turbine 1–4′–5–6. Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of the smaller ideal gas turbine cycle is less than that of the larger gas turbine cycle. In effect, a less efficient gas turbine cycle has been added to a more efficient cycle. Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle is less than that of the simple cycle gas turbine whose overall pressure ratios are the same as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

Furthermore, for a given minimum cycle temperature, T1, increasing the maximum cycle temperature, T5, increases the specific work of the larger.

Since the ideal thermal efficiency of the larger gas turbine is greater than the smaller gas turbine, the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled gas turbine cycle will increase with increase in the maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

# 64 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Therefore, the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle increases with an increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, and this differs from the case of the simple gas turbine cycle, where the ideal thermal efficiency is independent of this temperature ratio. Of course, the specific work of the intercooled gas turbine is higher than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, as shown in Fig. 3.5. As was found with the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the specific work of the ideal intercooled gas turbine is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Fig. 3.5. It is additionally observed that the maximum specific work occurs at a higher pressure ratio compared with the simple cycle gas turbine.

# 3.1.3 Practical intercooled cycle

The ideal intercooled cycle considers only isentropic compression and expansion processes and ignores any pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes. In a practical cycle, such assumptions are never achieved and the effect of irreversibilities discussed in Chapter 2 results in a significant loss in thermal efficiency and specific work. Furthermore, the conclusion that an ideal intercooled cycle always results in a lower thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine may not hold.

This is illustrated by considering the case discussed in Section 2.9 where the impact of irreversibilities on the performance of the simple cycle gas turbine was investigated. In particular, the case where the maximum cycle temperature was increased sufficiently so that the turbine expansion work.

was equal to the compressor absorbed work will be considered. Since a finite amount of heat was supplied, the thermal efficiency was zero. If the compression process is intercooled, the reduction in compressor specific work will now result in a finite specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle, i.e. the turbine work remains the same, while the compression work decreases.

Although the heat input has now increased to maintain the same maximum cycle temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3.6, the positive specific work from the intercooled gas turbine cycle will result in a positive thermal efficiency. Thus, when irreversibilities are considered, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. The optimisation of a practical intercooled gas turbine for maximum thermal efficiency may not result in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios being equal and generally the LP compressor pressure ratio will be much less than the optimum value for minimum compression work.

Optimisation of the split in the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios can therefore achieve a worthwhile increase in the thermal efficiency compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. This point is illustrated in Fig. 3.7 where the optimised intercooled gas turbine thermal efficiency is plotted against specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios, Pr, and maximum cycle temperatures, T₅. Thermal efficiencies of the order of 45% are possible with intercooling and one major manufacturer is seriously considering the manufacture of such gas turbines. 1 A discussion of the benefits is given in Modern Power Systems.2 The optimised LP compressor pressure ratios are shown in Fig. ","Under what condition can intercooling increase the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine cycle compared to a simple cycle, as per 'Hydrocarbon Fuels'?","When irreversibilities are considered, intercooling can increase thermal efficiency.","The book suggests that in practical cycles with irreversibilities, intercooling may enhance thermal efficiency over the simple cycle.","In 'Hydrocarbon Fuels', it's highlighted that intercooling can lead to higher thermal efficiency in practical scenarios where the simple cycle's efficiency is compromised by irreversibilities.","Goodger, E.M. points out that intercooling offers a thermal efficiency advantage in real-world gas turbine cycles affected by irreversibilities, unlike in ideal conditions.","According to the book, intercooling has the potential to improve thermal efficiency in practical gas turbine cycles, especially when the simple cycle's performance is limited by irreversibilities."

# 3 Complex gas turbine cycle

In Chapter 2 the design point performance of the simple cycle gas turbine, which consists of a compressor, combustor and turbine, was considered. Although the inclusion of a heat exchanger (referred to as the regenerative cycle) was also considered, it is the addition of intercooling to reduce the compressor work, and reheat to augment the turbine work, that are usually referred to as complex cycles. In this chapter the design point performance of such cycles, including the addition of a heat exchanger, will be considered.

# 3.1 Intercooled gas turbine cycles

When the performance of the simple and regenerative cycle gas turbine was considered, it was assumed that the compression process was isentropic. The compression work required by these cycles may be reduced by dividing the compression process into two stages. These comprise the LP and the HP stages as shown in Fig. 3.1, and also cooling to reduce the LP compressor discharge air temperature, T₂, back to its inlet temperature (i.e. reducing T₃ to T₁). It was shown in Chapter 2 that the compressor-specific work requirement to achieve a given pressure ratio is given by:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1)

which, for an isentropic process, can be expressed as

|Intercooler|Fuel input|6| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|4|5|1–2 Low pressure (LP) compression| |
| |Combustor| | |2–3 Intercooling| |3–4 High pressure (HP) compression|
|LP|HP| |Load|4–5 Heat addition| |5–6 Expansion|
| |Compressors| | | | | |

3.1 Schematic representation of an intercooled gas turbine.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Wcomp = cp T1 ((Pr)γ – 1)

Therefore, reducing T1 will reduce the compressor work required to achieve a given compressor pressure ratio, Pr. Thus, intercooling results in a reduction in the compressor work requirement of the HP compressor and hence reduces the overall compression work required to achieve a given overall compressor pressure ratio, P4/P1.

# 3.1.1 Optimisation of intercooled compressors

The optimisation of an intercooled compressor involves the determination of the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios such that the compression power required is a minimum. If the LP compressor pressure ratio is unity or equal to the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1, then no reduction in compressor work absorbed will occur. The question that arises is ‘what LP compressor pressure ratio will result in the minimum compressor work absorbed’. The compression process for intercooled compressors is shown on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 3.2 for an arbitrary value for the LP compressor ratio, Prlp.

The HP pressure ratio, Prhp, will then be given by Pro/Prlp, where Pro is the overall pressure ratio, P4/P1. The compression work, Wcomp, is therefore:

Wcomp = cp(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T3)

Since T3 = T1 due to intercooling

Wcomp = cp[(T2 – T1) + cp(T4 – T1)] [3.1]

Equation 3.1 can be represented in terms of the LP and overall pressure ratio as:

Wcomp = cT ⎛       γ –1  ⌈ Pr    ⌉γγ–1   ⎜
(Prlp)γ +    o           ⎝
⎛             ⎜   lp  ⎝       ⎝

Differentiating Equation 3.2 with respect to Prlp and equating to zero gives:

Prlp =   Pro                                                     [3.3]

By considering the second derivative of Equation 3.2, it can be shown that the condition expressed in Equation 3.3 is a minimum. Therefore, the minimum work absorbed by an intercooled compression system occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal.

# 3.1.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal intercooled gas turbine

The intercooled gas turbine shown in Fig. 3.1 may be represented on the temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.3. Since we are considering the ideal performance of the cycle, the thermodynamic processes involved are:

In effect, a less efficient gas turbine cycle has been added to a more efficient cycle. Thus the ideal thermal efficiency of an intercooled gas turbine cycle is less than that of the simple cycle gas turbine whose overall pressure ratios are the same as illustrated in Fig. 3.4.

Furthermore, for a given minimum cycle temperature, T1, increasing the maximum cycle temperature, T5, increases the specific work of the larger.
