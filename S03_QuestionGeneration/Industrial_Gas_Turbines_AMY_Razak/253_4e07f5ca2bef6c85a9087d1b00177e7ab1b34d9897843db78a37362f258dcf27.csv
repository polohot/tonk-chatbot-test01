Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What effect does the increase in compressor pressure ratio have on thermal efficiency in a gas turbine?,The increase in compressor pressure ratio results in a small increase in thermal efficiency.,Thermal efficiency sees a slight boost due to the higher compressor pressure ratio.,A higher compressor pressure ratio leads to a minor enhancement in thermal efficiency.,Thermal efficiency improves marginally as the compressor pressure ratio increases.,The net effect of increasing the compressor pressure ratio is a small rise in thermal efficiency.

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",How does the compressor isentropic efficiency change during the ambient temperature transient?,"The compressor isentropic efficiency increases then decreases when the VIGV is fully opened, and decreases more rapidly when the VIGV closes.","Initially, compressor efficiency rises and then falls with the VIGV open, followed by a sharper decline during VIGV closure.","With the VIGV open, compressor efficiency first improves and then worsens, deteriorating further as the VIGV closes.","Compressor efficiency shows an initial increase and subsequent decrease during VIGV open phase, with accelerated decrease upon VIGV closing.","During the transient, compressor efficiency undergoes an increase and decrease with VIGV open, then a rapid decrease with VIGV closing."

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What trends are observed in gas turbine emissions during the ambient temperature transient?,"Although combustion pressure increases with the VIGV fully opened, the reduction in combustion temperature affects emissions trends.",Emissions trends are influenced by higher combustion pressure but lower combustion temperature during the transient.,"The transient shows increased combustion pressure yet decreased temperature, impacting emissions.",Emissions during the transient are shaped by opposing trends of rising combustion pressure and falling temperature.,A rise in combustion pressure coupled with a drop in temperature characterizes the emissions trends during the transient.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.
