In this chapter the engine simulator will be used to simulate many of these faults to investigate the impact they have on engine performance and the change in running line characteristics. Some simple methods to detect engine performance deterioration will also be discussed, particularly compressor fouling, which is the most common cause of performance deterioration. Two operating cases will be considered and they correspond to a high power output and a low power output condition, respectively.

# 13.1 Compressor fouling (high operating power)

As stated above, compressor fouling is the most common form of engine performance deterioration and it affects all open cycle gas turbines. The level of fouling depends on many factors. The main factors are the level of dirt and particles in the atmosphere, quality of air filtration and, to a certain extent, the power output of the gas turbine, particularly in multiple shaft gas turbines such as that represented by this simulator. As explained above, compressor fouling occurs because of the deposit of dirt and dust particles on the compressor blades, thus altering the shape of the compressor characteristic. An example of the change in compressor characteristic is shown and discussed in Chapter 9, Section 9.1.

Compressor fouling is simulated using this simulator by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow linearly with time for any given non-dimensional compressor speed. (It should be noted that compressor fouling is not linear. Experience has shown that the rate of fouling decreases with time as deposits of dirt and dust collect on the compressor blades, changing the profile of the blade.) Thus the compressor non-dimensional speed line shifts to the left due to the reduction in capacity as shown in Fig. 9.3.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft also reduces the efficiency of the compressor and this is simulated by decreasing the compressor efficiency linearly and simultaneously with non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency for a moderately fouled compressor is about 3% and 1% respectively.

Fault indices are used to represent engine component performance deterioration. Fault indices simply represent the changes in the component characteristics. There are two fault indices per engine component and these are referred to as the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. The fouling fault index represents the change in the non-dimensional flow capacity of the engine component and the efficiency fault index represents the change in the efficiency of the engine component. The simulation of compressor fouling is achieved by displaying the gas turbine degradation page and typing in –3% for the compressor fouling fault index and –1% for the compressor efficiency fault index. A suitable ramp time is selected, which represents the time for compressor fouling to take effect. Compressor fouling takes weeks or months but the process will be accelerated and a ramp time of 1 hour (3600 seconds) used.

As the current interest is in the impact of compressor fouling at high powers, such that the engine is on an engine-operating limit, the power from the generator is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity will be set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the inlet and exhaust losses will both be set to 100 mm of water gauge. The simulation is carried out for 4000 seconds.

# 13.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trends in fault indices are shown in Fig. 13.1, which displays the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively. The compressor fouling fault index varies linearly from 0% to –3% in 3600 seconds and this is, of course, the input made to the model. Similarly, the compressor efficiency fault index varies linearly from 0% to –1% in 3600 seconds.

These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine components remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 13.1.2 Compressor characteristic

# 13.2 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling when the engine is operating at a control limit.

The non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains essentially constant during fouling when the engine is operating on a control limit – EGT limited (high power operation). Thus compressor fouling at these operating conditions will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure and compressor inlet mass flow.

# 13.1.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.3. As discussed previously, a decrease in compressor pressure ratio is observed. The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing, as seen in Section 8.1.2. The constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio now results in a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio. However, the decrease in power turbine pressure ratio is smaller than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, which remains constant during fouling. This is because the engine is operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit. Since the ambient temperature is constant during this simulation, T₃/T₁ is therefore essentially constant.

# 13.1.4 Trends in pressure

Figure 13.4 shows the trends in pressure during compressor fouling. The decrease in compressor pressure ratio during fouling results in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in compressor discharge pressure also results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure because the gas generator turbine operates at a constant pressure ratio. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure decreases with the compressor discharge pressure, as the combustion system pressure loss does not change very much.

The most important aspects of engine performance are power output and thermal efficiency. The impact of compressor fouling has an adverse effect on these performance parameters and, in Fig. 13.5 the power output from the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft gas turbine is observed decreasing from about 21 MW to about 20 MW. Although this only represents a 1 MW drop in power output, it corresponds to about a 5% loss in power output and thus a loss of 5% in revenue. It is also observed that the thermal efficiency decreases from 36% to about 35.5%, which represents about 1.5% increase in fuel flow and therefore a 1.5% increase in fuel cost. Although these numbers appear small, they represent a significant loss in revenue and increase in operating costs. Thus the detection and management of compressor fouling is of paramount importance in maintaining the profitability of industries that use gas turbines as a source of power. The figure also shows the trends in gas power and gas thermal efficiency and these follow a similar trend to the gas turbine power output and gas turbine thermal efficiency.

# 13.1.6 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.6. The compressor inlet mass flow is observed to decrease and this is due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow during fouling. Since the compressor inlet pressure and temperature remain constant in this simulation, any decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow P results in a proportional decrease in compressor inlet mass flow, W¹√T¹/ W₁. Since the power loss due to compressor fouling is greater than the efficiency loss, the fuel flow decreases. The air–fuel ratio remains constant because the combustion system temperature rises and the compressor exit temperature remain essentially constant during fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.7.

# 13.1.7 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperature at the inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 13.7. The temperature trends remain essentially constant during compressor fouling for this case. Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency results in a near constant compressor exit temperature.

The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. Thus the temperature ratio across the gas generator turbine is approximately constant as discussed in Section 8.1.2. Since the engine operates at a constant exhaust gas temperature, T₄, the turbine entry temperature, T₃ and the combustion temperature remain essentially constant.

As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant and there is only a small decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio that occurs during this transient, as shown in Fig. 13.3, the increase in the power turbine exit temperature is small.

# 13.1.8 Trends in speed

Figure 13.8 shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during compressor fouling. These speeds are observed to remain essentially constant during compressor fouling. This is because the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature limit and therefore there is no significant margin to increase or alter the speed during fouling.

The trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.9. A slight decrease is observed in both the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage during compressor fouling. It was observed that the compressor mass flow decreases during

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

Compressor fouling and the compressor temperature rise is essentially constant. Thus the power absorbed by the compressor decreases during fouling. Since the compressor power is provided by the gas generator turbine, the gas generator turbine power also decreases during fouling. Thus the torque produced by the gas generator turbine blades will decrease. It was also observed that the gas generator speed and turbine temperatures remain essentially constant during fouling. The constant gas generator speed will result in a constant centrifugal stress, but the reduction in the torque acting on the turbine blade will result in a lower bending stress. The net effect reduces the stresses in the gas generator turbine blades and therefore decreases the gas generator turbine creep life usage.

The power turbine speed remains constant at 3000 RPM during the simulation. The decrease in power output from the gas turbine due to compressor fouling will therefore reduce the stress in the power turbine blades (lower torque). As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant during this simulation, the creep life usage of the power turbine also decreases due to the lower stresses that prevail in the power turbine blades. However, for a given exhaust gas temperature, compressor fouling results in reduced power output from the gas turbine and therefore, in real terms, there is an increase in creep life usage due to fouling. The reader can illustrate this by running the simulator at reduced power outputs typical of fouling, but when no compressor fouling is present.

# 13.1.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the combustion pressure, decreases during compressor fouling. However, the primary zone temperature remains constant during the simulation of fouling. Thus a decrease in NOx is observed during compressor fouling, due to the lower combustion pressure. The emission of CO, on the other hand, remains essentially constant, as the formation of CO is more sensitive to primary zone temperature than combustion pressure. These trends can be seen in Fig. ",What is the most common cause of engine performance deterioration discussed in the text?,Compressor fouling is identified as the most common cause of engine performance deterioration.,The text highlights compressor fouling as the primary factor leading to engine performance deterioration.,"Among various factors, compressor fouling is the most prevalent cause of engine performance degradation.","Engine performance deterioration most commonly results from compressor fouling, as detailed in the text.",The most frequent reason for engine performance deterioration mentioned is compressor fouling.

Compressor fouling and the compressor temperature rise is essentially constant. Thus the power absorbed by the compressor decreases during fouling. Since the compressor power is provided by the gas generator turbine, the gas generator turbine power also decreases during fouling. Thus the torque produced by the gas generator turbine blades will decrease. It was also observed that the gas generator speed and turbine temperatures remain essentially constant during fouling. The constant gas generator speed will result in a constant centrifugal stress, but the reduction in the torque acting on the turbine blade will result in a lower bending stress. The net effect reduces the stresses in the gas generator turbine blades and therefore decreases the gas generator turbine creep life usage.

The power turbine speed remains constant at 3000 RPM during the simulation. The decrease in power output from the gas turbine due to compressor fouling will therefore reduce the stress in the power turbine blades (lower torque). As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant during this simulation, the creep life usage of the power turbine also decreases due to the lower stresses that prevail in the power turbine blades. However, for a given exhaust gas temperature, compressor fouling results in reduced power output from the gas turbine and therefore, in real terms, there is an increase in creep life usage due to fouling. The reader can illustrate this by running the simulator at reduced power outputs typical of fouling, but when no compressor fouling is present.

# 13.1.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the combustion pressure, decreases during compressor fouling. However, the primary zone temperature remains constant during the simulation of fouling. Thus a decrease in NOx is observed during compressor fouling, due to the lower combustion pressure. The emission of CO, on the other hand, remains essentially constant, as the formation of CO is more sensitive to primary zone temperature than combustion pressure. These trends can be seen in Fig. ",How is compressor fouling simulated in the engine simulator?,Compressor fouling is simulated by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency linearly with time.,The simulation involves decreasing both the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency to mimic fouling effects.,"By linearly reducing the compressor's non-dimensional flow and efficiency, the simulator replicates fouling.",Fouling simulation is achieved through a linear reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency over time.,The simulator models compressor fouling by adjusting the non-dimensional flow and efficiency downwards linearly.

In this chapter the engine simulator will be used to simulate many of these faults to investigate the impact they have on engine performance and the change in running line characteristics. Some simple methods to detect engine performance deterioration will also be discussed, particularly compressor fouling, which is the most common cause of performance deterioration. Two operating cases will be considered and they correspond to a high power output and a low power output condition, respectively.

# 13.1 Compressor fouling (high operating power)

As stated above, compressor fouling is the most common form of engine performance deterioration and it affects all open cycle gas turbines. The level of fouling depends on many factors. The main factors are the level of dirt and particles in the atmosphere, quality of air filtration and, to a certain extent, the power output of the gas turbine, particularly in multiple shaft gas turbines such as that represented by this simulator. As explained above, compressor fouling occurs because of the deposit of dirt and dust particles on the compressor blades, thus altering the shape of the compressor characteristic. An example of the change in compressor characteristic is shown and discussed in Chapter 9, Section 9.1.

Compressor fouling is simulated using this simulator by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow linearly with time for any given non-dimensional compressor speed. (It should be noted that compressor fouling is not linear. Experience has shown that the rate of fouling decreases with time as deposits of dirt and dust collect on the compressor blades, changing the profile of the blade.) Thus the compressor non-dimensional speed line shifts to the left due to the reduction in capacity as shown in Fig. 9.3.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft also reduces the efficiency of the compressor and this is simulated by decreasing the compressor efficiency linearly and simultaneously with non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency for a moderately fouled compressor is about 3% and 1% respectively.

Fault indices are used to represent engine component performance deterioration. Fault indices simply represent the changes in the component characteristics. There are two fault indices per engine component and these are referred to as the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. The fouling fault index represents the change in the non-dimensional flow capacity of the engine component and the efficiency fault index represents the change in the efficiency of the engine component. The simulation of compressor fouling is achieved by displaying the gas turbine degradation page and typing in –3% for the compressor fouling fault index and –1% for the compressor efficiency fault index. A suitable ramp time is selected, which represents the time for compressor fouling to take effect. Compressor fouling takes weeks or months but the process will be accelerated and a ramp time of 1 hour (3600 seconds) used.

As the current interest is in the impact of compressor fouling at high powers, such that the engine is on an engine-operating limit, the power from the generator is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity will be set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the inlet and exhaust losses will both be set to 100 mm of water gauge. The simulation is carried out for 4000 seconds.

# 13.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trends in fault indices are shown in Fig. 13.1, which displays the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively. The compressor fouling fault index varies linearly from 0% to –3% in 3600 seconds and this is, of course, the input made to the model. Similarly, the compressor efficiency fault index varies linearly from 0% to –1% in 3600 seconds.

These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine components remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 13.2 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling when the engine is operating at a control limit.

The non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains essentially constant during fouling when the engine is operating on a control limit – EGT limited (high power operation). Thus compressor fouling at these operating conditions will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure and compressor inlet mass flow.

# 13.1.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.3. As discussed previously, a decrease in compressor pressure ratio is observed. The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing, as seen in Section 8.1.2. The constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio now results in a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio. However, the decrease in power turbine pressure ratio is smaller than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, which remains constant during fouling. This is because the engine is operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit. Since the ambient temperature is constant during this simulation, T₃/T₁ is therefore essentially constant.

# 13.1.4 Trends in pressure

Figure 13.4 shows the trends in pressure during compressor fouling. The decrease in compressor pressure ratio during fouling results in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in compressor discharge pressure also results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure because the gas generator turbine operates at a constant pressure ratio. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure decreases with the compressor discharge pressure, as the combustion system pressure loss does not change very much.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft gas turbine is observed decreasing from about 21 MW to about 20 MW. Although this only represents a 1 MW drop in power output, it corresponds to about a 5% loss in power output and thus a loss of 5% in revenue. It is also observed that the thermal efficiency decreases from 36% to about 35.5%, which represents about 1.5% increase in fuel flow and therefore a 1.5% increase in fuel cost. Although these numbers appear small, they represent a significant loss in revenue and increase in operating costs. Thus the detection and management of compressor fouling is of paramount importance in maintaining the profitability of industries that use gas turbines as a source of power. The figure also shows the trends in gas power and gas thermal efficiency and these follow a similar trend to the gas turbine power output and gas turbine thermal efficiency.

# 13.1.6 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.6. The compressor inlet mass flow is observed to decrease and this is due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow during fouling. Since the compressor inlet pressure and temperature remain constant in this simulation, any decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow P results in a proportional decrease in compressor inlet mass flow, W¹√T¹/ W₁. Since the power loss due to compressor fouling is greater than the efficiency loss, the fuel flow decreases. The air–fuel ratio remains constant because the combustion system temperature rises and the compressor exit temperature remain essentially constant during fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.7.

# 13.1.7 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperature at the inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 13.7. The temperature trends remain essentially constant during compressor fouling for this case. Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency results in a near constant compressor exit temperature.

The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. Thus the temperature ratio across the gas generator turbine is approximately constant as discussed in Section 8.1.2. Since the engine operates at a constant exhaust gas temperature, T₄, the turbine entry temperature, T₃ and the combustion temperature remain essentially constant.

As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant and there is only a small decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio that occurs during this transient, as shown in Fig. 13.3, the increase in the power turbine exit temperature is small.

# 13.1.8 Trends in speed

Figure 13.8 shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during compressor fouling. These speeds are observed to remain essentially constant during compressor fouling. This is because the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature limit and therefore there is no significant margin to increase or alter the speed during fouling.

Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency results in a near constant compressor exit temperature.

The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. Thus the temperature ratio across the gas generator turbine is approximately constant as discussed in Section 8.1.2. Since the engine operates at a constant exhaust gas temperature, T₄, the turbine entry temperature, T₃ and the combustion temperature remain essentially constant.

As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant and there is only a small decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio that occurs during this transient, as shown in Fig. 13.3, the increase in the power turbine exit temperature is small.

# 13.1.8 Trends in speed

Figure 13.8 shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during compressor fouling. These speeds are observed to remain essentially constant during compressor fouling. This is because the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature limit and therefore there is no significant margin to increase or alter the speed during fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

Compressor fouling and the compressor temperature rise is essentially constant. Thus the power absorbed by the compressor decreases during fouling. Since the compressor power is provided by the gas generator turbine, the gas generator turbine power also decreases during fouling. Thus the torque produced by the gas generator turbine blades will decrease. It was also observed that the gas generator speed and turbine temperatures remain essentially constant during fouling. The constant gas generator speed will result in a constant centrifugal stress, but the reduction in the torque acting on the turbine blade will result in a lower bending stress. The net effect reduces the stresses in the gas generator turbine blades and therefore decreases the gas generator turbine creep life usage.

The power turbine speed remains constant at 3000 RPM during the simulation. The decrease in power output from the gas turbine due to compressor fouling will therefore reduce the stress in the power turbine blades (lower torque). As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant during this simulation, the creep life usage of the power turbine also decreases due to the lower stresses that prevail in the power turbine blades. However, for a given exhaust gas temperature, compressor fouling results in reduced power output from the gas turbine and therefore, in real terms, there is an increase in creep life usage due to fouling. The reader can illustrate this by running the simulator at reduced power outputs typical of fouling, but when no compressor fouling is present.

# 13.1.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the combustion pressure, decreases during compressor fouling. However, the primary zone temperature remains constant during the simulation of fouling. Thus a decrease in NOx is observed during compressor fouling, due to the lower combustion pressure. The emission of CO, on the other hand, remains essentially constant, as the formation of CO is more sensitive to primary zone temperature than combustion pressure. These trends can be seen in Fig. ",What impact does compressor fouling have on power output and thermal efficiency?,Compressor fouling reduces power output by about 5% and thermal efficiency by approximately 1.5%.,The text notes a 5% decrease in power output and a 1.5% drop in thermal efficiency due to fouling.,Fouling leads to a 5% loss in power and a 1.5% decrease in thermal efficiency.,Power output falls by 5% and thermal efficiency by 1.5% as a result of compressor fouling.,A 5% reduction in power and a 1.5% decline in thermal efficiency are caused by compressor fouling.

In this chapter the engine simulator will be used to simulate many of these faults to investigate the impact they have on engine performance and the change in running line characteristics. Some simple methods to detect engine performance deterioration will also be discussed, particularly compressor fouling, which is the most common cause of performance deterioration. Two operating cases will be considered and they correspond to a high power output and a low power output condition, respectively.

# 13.1 Compressor fouling (high operating power)

As stated above, compressor fouling is the most common form of engine performance deterioration and it affects all open cycle gas turbines. The level of fouling depends on many factors. The main factors are the level of dirt and particles in the atmosphere, quality of air filtration and, to a certain extent, the power output of the gas turbine, particularly in multiple shaft gas turbines such as that represented by this simulator. As explained above, compressor fouling occurs because of the deposit of dirt and dust particles on the compressor blades, thus altering the shape of the compressor characteristic. An example of the change in compressor characteristic is shown and discussed in Chapter 9, Section 9.1.

Compressor fouling is simulated using this simulator by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow linearly with time for any given non-dimensional compressor speed. (It should be noted that compressor fouling is not linear. Experience has shown that the rate of fouling decreases with time as deposits of dirt and dust collect on the compressor blades, changing the profile of the blade.) Thus the compressor non-dimensional speed line shifts to the left due to the reduction in capacity as shown in Fig. 9.3.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft also reduces the efficiency of the compressor and this is simulated by decreasing the compressor efficiency linearly and simultaneously with non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency for a moderately fouled compressor is about 3% and 1% respectively.

Fault indices are used to represent engine component performance deterioration. Fault indices simply represent the changes in the component characteristics. There are two fault indices per engine component and these are referred to as the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. The fouling fault index represents the change in the non-dimensional flow capacity of the engine component and the efficiency fault index represents the change in the efficiency of the engine component. The simulation of compressor fouling is achieved by displaying the gas turbine degradation page and typing in –3% for the compressor fouling fault index and –1% for the compressor efficiency fault index. A suitable ramp time is selected, which represents the time for compressor fouling to take effect. Compressor fouling takes weeks or months but the process will be accelerated and a ramp time of 1 hour (3600 seconds) used.

As the current interest is in the impact of compressor fouling at high powers, such that the engine is on an engine-operating limit, the power from the generator is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity will be set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the inlet and exhaust losses will both be set to 100 mm of water gauge. The simulation is carried out for 4000 seconds.

# 13.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trends in fault indices are shown in Fig. 13.1, which displays the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively. The compressor fouling fault index varies linearly from 0% to –3% in 3600 seconds and this is, of course, the input made to the model. Similarly, the compressor efficiency fault index varies linearly from 0% to –1% in 3600 seconds.

These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine components remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 13.2 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling when the engine is operating at a control limit.

The non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains essentially constant during fouling when the engine is operating on a control limit – EGT limited (high power operation). Thus compressor fouling at these operating conditions will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure and compressor inlet mass flow.

# 13.1.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.3. As discussed previously, a decrease in compressor pressure ratio is observed. The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing, as seen in Section 8.1.2. The constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio now results in a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio. However, the decrease in power turbine pressure ratio is smaller than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, which remains constant during fouling. This is because the engine is operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit. Since the ambient temperature is constant during this simulation, T₃/T₁ is therefore essentially constant.

# 13.1.4 Trends in pressure

Figure 13.4 shows the trends in pressure during compressor fouling. The decrease in compressor pressure ratio during fouling results in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in compressor discharge pressure also results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure because the gas generator turbine operates at a constant pressure ratio. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure decreases with the compressor discharge pressure, as the combustion system pressure loss does not change very much.

The most important aspects of engine performance are power output and thermal efficiency. The impact of compressor fouling has an adverse effect on these performance parameters and, in Fig. 13.5 the power output from the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft gas turbine is observed decreasing from about 21 MW to about 20 MW. Although this only represents a 1 MW drop in power output, it corresponds to about a 5% loss in power output and thus a loss of 5% in revenue. It is also observed that the thermal efficiency decreases from 36% to about 35.5%, which represents about 1.5% increase in fuel flow and therefore a 1.5% increase in fuel cost. Although these numbers appear small, they represent a significant loss in revenue and increase in operating costs. Thus the detection and management of compressor fouling is of paramount importance in maintaining the profitability of industries that use gas turbines as a source of power. The figure also shows the trends in gas power and gas thermal efficiency and these follow a similar trend to the gas turbine power output and gas turbine thermal efficiency.

# 13.1.6 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.6. The compressor inlet mass flow is observed to decrease and this is due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow during fouling. Since the compressor inlet pressure and temperature remain constant in this simulation, any decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow P results in a proportional decrease in compressor inlet mass flow, W¹√T¹/ W₁. Since the power loss due to compressor fouling is greater than the efficiency loss, the fuel flow decreases. The air–fuel ratio remains constant because the combustion system temperature rises and the compressor exit temperature remain essentially constant during fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.7.

It is also observed that the thermal efficiency decreases from 36% to about 35.5%, which represents about 1.5% increase in fuel flow and therefore a 1.5% increase in fuel cost. Although these numbers appear small, they represent a significant loss in revenue and increase in operating costs. Thus the detection and management of compressor fouling is of paramount importance in maintaining the profitability of industries that use gas turbines as a source of power. The figure also shows the trends in gas power and gas thermal efficiency and these follow a similar trend to the gas turbine power output and gas turbine thermal efficiency.

# 13.1.6 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.6. The compressor inlet mass flow is observed to decrease and this is due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow during fouling. Since the compressor inlet pressure and temperature remain constant in this simulation, any decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow P results in a proportional decrease in compressor inlet mass flow, W¹√T¹/ W₁. Since the power loss due to compressor fouling is greater than the efficiency loss, the fuel flow decreases. The air–fuel ratio remains constant because the combustion system temperature rises and the compressor exit temperature remain essentially constant during fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.7.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

# 13.1.7 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperature at the inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 13.7. The temperature trends remain essentially constant during compressor fouling for this case. Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency results in a near constant compressor exit temperature.

The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. Thus the temperature ratio across the gas generator turbine is approximately constant as discussed in Section 8.1.2. Since the engine operates at a constant exhaust gas temperature, T₄, the turbine entry temperature, T₃ and the combustion temperature remain essentially constant.

As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant and there is only a small decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio that occurs during this transient, as shown in Fig. 13.3, the increase in the power turbine exit temperature is small.

# 13.1.8 Trends in speed

Figure 13.8 shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during compressor fouling. These speeds are observed to remain essentially constant during compressor fouling. This is because the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature limit and therefore there is no significant margin to increase or alter the speed during fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

Compressor fouling and the compressor temperature rise is essentially constant. Thus the power absorbed by the compressor decreases during fouling. Since the compressor power is provided by the gas generator turbine, the gas generator turbine power also decreases during fouling. Thus the torque produced by the gas generator turbine blades will decrease. It was also observed that the gas generator speed and turbine temperatures remain essentially constant during fouling. The constant gas generator speed will result in a constant centrifugal stress, but the reduction in the torque acting on the turbine blade will result in a lower bending stress. The net effect reduces the stresses in the gas generator turbine blades and therefore decreases the gas generator turbine creep life usage.

The power turbine speed remains constant at 3000 RPM during the simulation. The decrease in power output from the gas turbine due to compressor fouling will therefore reduce the stress in the power turbine blades (lower torque). As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant during this simulation, the creep life usage of the power turbine also decreases due to the lower stresses that prevail in the power turbine blades. However, for a given exhaust gas temperature, compressor fouling results in reduced power output from the gas turbine and therefore, in real terms, there is an increase in creep life usage due to fouling. The reader can illustrate this by running the simulator at reduced power outputs typical of fouling, but when no compressor fouling is present.

# 13.1.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the combustion pressure, decreases during compressor fouling. However, the primary zone temperature remains constant during the simulation of fouling. Thus a decrease in NOx is observed during compressor fouling, due to the lower combustion pressure. The emission of CO, on the other hand, remains essentially constant, as the formation of CO is more sensitive to primary zone temperature than combustion pressure. These trends can be seen in Fig. ",What are fault indices and how are they used in simulating compressor fouling?,"Fault indices represent changes in component characteristics, with fouling and efficiency indices used to simulate fouling by adjusting flow and efficiency.","Used in simulation, fault indices quantify changes in component performance, specifically fouling and efficiency, to model fouling effects.",Simulating fouling involves fault indices that track alterations in component flow and efficiency characteristics.,"Fault indices, indicating component performance changes, are applied to simulate fouling through adjustments in flow and efficiency.","In fouling simulation, fault indices for flow and efficiency changes are utilized to represent component performance deterioration."

In this chapter the engine simulator will be used to simulate many of these faults to investigate the impact they have on engine performance and the change in running line characteristics. Some simple methods to detect engine performance deterioration will also be discussed, particularly compressor fouling, which is the most common cause of performance deterioration. Two operating cases will be considered and they correspond to a high power output and a low power output condition, respectively.

# 13.1 Compressor fouling (high operating power)

As stated above, compressor fouling is the most common form of engine performance deterioration and it affects all open cycle gas turbines. The level of fouling depends on many factors. The main factors are the level of dirt and particles in the atmosphere, quality of air filtration and, to a certain extent, the power output of the gas turbine, particularly in multiple shaft gas turbines such as that represented by this simulator. As explained above, compressor fouling occurs because of the deposit of dirt and dust particles on the compressor blades, thus altering the shape of the compressor characteristic. An example of the change in compressor characteristic is shown and discussed in Chapter 9, Section 9.1.

Compressor fouling is simulated using this simulator by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow linearly with time for any given non-dimensional compressor speed. (It should be noted that compressor fouling is not linear. Experience has shown that the rate of fouling decreases with time as deposits of dirt and dust collect on the compressor blades, changing the profile of the blade.) Thus the compressor non-dimensional speed line shifts to the left due to the reduction in capacity as shown in Fig. 9.3.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft also reduces the efficiency of the compressor and this is simulated by decreasing the compressor efficiency linearly and simultaneously with non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency for a moderately fouled compressor is about 3% and 1% respectively.

Fault indices are used to represent engine component performance deterioration. Fault indices simply represent the changes in the component characteristics. There are two fault indices per engine component and these are referred to as the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. The fouling fault index represents the change in the non-dimensional flow capacity of the engine component and the efficiency fault index represents the change in the efficiency of the engine component. The simulation of compressor fouling is achieved by displaying the gas turbine degradation page and typing in –3% for the compressor fouling fault index and –1% for the compressor efficiency fault index. A suitable ramp time is selected, which represents the time for compressor fouling to take effect. Compressor fouling takes weeks or months but the process will be accelerated and a ramp time of 1 hour (3600 seconds) used.

As the current interest is in the impact of compressor fouling at high powers, such that the engine is on an engine-operating limit, the power from the generator is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity will be set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the inlet and exhaust losses will both be set to 100 mm of water gauge. The simulation is carried out for 4000 seconds.

# 13.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trends in fault indices are shown in Fig. 13.1, which displays the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively. The compressor fouling fault index varies linearly from 0% to –3% in 3600 seconds and this is, of course, the input made to the model. Similarly, the compressor efficiency fault index varies linearly from 0% to –1% in 3600 seconds.

These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine components remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 13.2 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling when the engine is operating at a control limit.

The non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains essentially constant during fouling when the engine is operating on a control limit – EGT limited (high power operation). Thus compressor fouling at these operating conditions will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure and compressor inlet mass flow.

# 13.1.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.3. As discussed previously, a decrease in compressor pressure ratio is observed. The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing, as seen in Section 8.1.2. The constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio now results in a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio. However, the decrease in power turbine pressure ratio is smaller than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, which remains constant during fouling. This is because the engine is operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit. Since the ambient temperature is constant during this simulation, T₃/T₁ is therefore essentially constant.

# 13.1.4 Trends in pressure

Figure 13.4 shows the trends in pressure during compressor fouling. The decrease in compressor pressure ratio during fouling results in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in compressor discharge pressure also results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure because the gas generator turbine operates at a constant pressure ratio. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure decreases with the compressor discharge pressure, as the combustion system pressure loss does not change very much.

# 13.1.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The most important aspects of engine performance are power output and thermal efficiency. The impact of compressor fouling has an adverse effect on these performance parameters and, in Fig. 13.5 the power output from the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft gas turbine is observed decreasing from about 21 MW to about 20 MW. Although this only represents a 1 MW drop in power output, it corresponds to about a 5% loss in power output and thus a loss of 5% in revenue. It is also observed that the thermal efficiency decreases from 36% to about 35.5%, which represents about 1.5% increase in fuel flow and therefore a 1.5% increase in fuel cost. Although these numbers appear small, they represent a significant loss in revenue and increase in operating costs. Thus the detection and management of compressor fouling is of paramount importance in maintaining the profitability of industries that use gas turbines as a source of power. The figure also shows the trends in gas power and gas thermal efficiency and these follow a similar trend to the gas turbine power output and gas turbine thermal efficiency.

# 13.1.6 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.6. The compressor inlet mass flow is observed to decrease and this is due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow during fouling. Since the compressor inlet pressure and temperature remain constant in this simulation, any decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow P results in a proportional decrease in compressor inlet mass flow, W¹√T¹/ W₁. Since the power loss due to compressor fouling is greater than the efficiency loss, the fuel flow decreases. The air–fuel ratio remains constant because the combustion system temperature rises and the compressor exit temperature remain essentially constant during fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.7.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

# 13.1.7 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperature at the inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 13.7. The temperature trends remain essentially constant during compressor fouling for this case. Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency results in a near constant compressor exit temperature.

The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. Thus the temperature ratio across the gas generator turbine is approximately constant as discussed in Section 8.1.2. Since the engine operates at a constant exhaust gas temperature, T₄, the turbine entry temperature, T₃ and the combustion temperature remain essentially constant.

As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant and there is only a small decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio that occurs during this transient, as shown in Fig. 13.3, the increase in the power turbine exit temperature is small.

# 13.1.8 Trends in speed

Figure 13.8 shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during compressor fouling. These speeds are observed to remain essentially constant during compressor fouling. This is because the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature limit and therefore there is no significant margin to increase or alter the speed during fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

Compressor fouling and the compressor temperature rise is essentially constant. Thus the power absorbed by the compressor decreases during fouling. Since the compressor power is provided by the gas generator turbine, the gas generator turbine power also decreases during fouling. Thus the torque produced by the gas generator turbine blades will decrease. It was also observed that the gas generator speed and turbine temperatures remain essentially constant during fouling. The constant gas generator speed will result in a constant centrifugal stress, but the reduction in the torque acting on the turbine blade will result in a lower bending stress. The net effect reduces the stresses in the gas generator turbine blades and therefore decreases the gas generator turbine creep life usage.

The power turbine speed remains constant at 3000 RPM during the simulation. The decrease in power output from the gas turbine due to compressor fouling will therefore reduce the stress in the power turbine blades (lower torque). As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant during this simulation, the creep life usage of the power turbine also decreases due to the lower stresses that prevail in the power turbine blades. However, for a given exhaust gas temperature, compressor fouling results in reduced power output from the gas turbine and therefore, in real terms, there is an increase in creep life usage due to fouling. The reader can illustrate this by running the simulator at reduced power outputs typical of fouling, but when no compressor fouling is present.

# 13.1.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the combustion pressure, decreases during compressor fouling. However, the primary zone temperature remains constant during the simulation of fouling. Thus a decrease in NOx is observed during compressor fouling, due to the lower combustion pressure. The emission of CO, on the other hand, remains essentially constant, as the formation of CO is more sensitive to primary zone temperature than combustion pressure. These trends can be seen in Fig. ",How do trends in pressure ratio change during compressor fouling?,"During fouling, compressor pressure ratio decreases, while gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains constant due to choked conditions.",The text describes a decrease in compressor pressure ratio and a constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio during fouling.,"Fouling leads to lower compressor pressure ratios, with gas generator turbine ratios unchanged because of choking.","A reduction in compressor pressure ratio is observed during fouling, with gas generator turbine ratios staying the same.","Compressor pressure ratio drops during fouling, whereas gas generator turbine pressure ratio does not change."

In this chapter the engine simulator will be used to simulate many of these faults to investigate the impact they have on engine performance and the change in running line characteristics. Some simple methods to detect engine performance deterioration will also be discussed, particularly compressor fouling, which is the most common cause of performance deterioration. Two operating cases will be considered and they correspond to a high power output and a low power output condition, respectively.

# 13.1 Compressor fouling (high operating power)

As stated above, compressor fouling is the most common form of engine performance deterioration and it affects all open cycle gas turbines. The level of fouling depends on many factors. The main factors are the level of dirt and particles in the atmosphere, quality of air filtration and, to a certain extent, the power output of the gas turbine, particularly in multiple shaft gas turbines such as that represented by this simulator. As explained above, compressor fouling occurs because of the deposit of dirt and dust particles on the compressor blades, thus altering the shape of the compressor characteristic. An example of the change in compressor characteristic is shown and discussed in Chapter 9, Section 9.1.

Compressor fouling is simulated using this simulator by reducing the compressor non-dimensional flow linearly with time for any given non-dimensional compressor speed. (It should be noted that compressor fouling is not linear. Experience has shown that the rate of fouling decreases with time as deposits of dirt and dust collect on the compressor blades, changing the profile of the blade.) Thus the compressor non-dimensional speed line shifts to the left due to the reduction in capacity as shown in Fig. 9.3.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft also reduces the efficiency of the compressor and this is simulated by decreasing the compressor efficiency linearly and simultaneously with non-dimensional flow. The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency for a moderately fouled compressor is about 3% and 1% respectively.

Fault indices are used to represent engine component performance deterioration. Fault indices simply represent the changes in the component characteristics. There are two fault indices per engine component and these are referred to as the fouling fault index and the efficiency fault index. The fouling fault index represents the change in the non-dimensional flow capacity of the engine component and the efficiency fault index represents the change in the efficiency of the engine component. The simulation of compressor fouling is achieved by displaying the gas turbine degradation page and typing in –3% for the compressor fouling fault index and –1% for the compressor efficiency fault index. A suitable ramp time is selected, which represents the time for compressor fouling to take effect. Compressor fouling takes weeks or months but the process will be accelerated and a ramp time of 1 hour (3600 seconds) used.

As the current interest is in the impact of compressor fouling at high powers, such that the engine is on an engine-operating limit, the power from the generator is set to 25 MW. The ambient pressure, temperature and relative humidity will be set to 1.013 Bar, 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively, and the inlet and exhaust losses will both be set to 100 mm of water gauge. The simulation is carried out for 4000 seconds.

# 13.1.1 Trends in fault indices

The trends in fault indices are shown in Fig. 13.1, which displays the changes in the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices, respectively. The compressor fouling fault index varies linearly from 0% to –3% in 3600 seconds and this is, of course, the input made to the model. Similarly, the compressor efficiency fault index varies linearly from 0% to –1% in 3600 seconds.

These changes in compressor fault indices affect the compressor characteristic by reducing the non-dimensional flow and compressor efficiency, thus simulating compressor fouling. No other fault is present and this is indicated by the fault indices for the turbine components remaining at zero throughout the simulation.

# 13.2 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during compressor fouling when the engine is operating at a control limit.

The non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains essentially constant during fouling when the engine is operating on a control limit – EGT limited (high power operation). Thus compressor fouling at these operating conditions will result in a decrease in compressor discharge pressure and compressor inlet mass flow.

# 13.1.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.3. As discussed previously, a decrease in compressor pressure ratio is observed. The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing, as seen in Section 8.1.2. The constant gas generator turbine pressure ratio now results in a decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio. However, the decrease in power turbine pressure ratio is smaller than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, which remains constant during fouling. This is because the engine is operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit. Since the ambient temperature is constant during this simulation, T₃/T₁ is therefore essentially constant.

# 13.1.4 Trends in pressure

Figure 13.4 shows the trends in pressure during compressor fouling. The decrease in compressor pressure ratio during fouling results in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in compressor discharge pressure also results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure because the gas generator turbine operates at a constant pressure ratio. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure decreases with the compressor discharge pressure, as the combustion system pressure loss does not change very much.

However, the decrease in power turbine pressure ratio is smaller than the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio.

The figure also shows the trend in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, which remains constant during fouling. This is because the engine is operating on an exhaust gas temperature limit. Since the ambient temperature is constant during this simulation, T₃/T₁ is therefore essentially constant.

# 13.1.4 Trends in pressure

Figure 13.4 shows the trends in pressure during compressor fouling. The decrease in compressor pressure ratio during fouling results in a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure. The decrease in compressor discharge pressure also results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure because the gas generator turbine operates at a constant pressure ratio. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure decreases with the compressor discharge pressure, as the combustion system pressure loss does not change very much.

# 13.1.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

The most important aspects of engine performance are power output and thermal efficiency. The impact of compressor fouling has an adverse effect on these performance parameters and, in Fig. 13.5 the power output from the

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft gas turbine is observed decreasing from about 21 MW to about 20 MW. Although this only represents a 1 MW drop in power output, it corresponds to about a 5% loss in power output and thus a loss of 5% in revenue. It is also observed that the thermal efficiency decreases from 36% to about 35.5%, which represents about 1.5% increase in fuel flow and therefore a 1.5% increase in fuel cost. Although these numbers appear small, they represent a significant loss in revenue and increase in operating costs. Thus the detection and management of compressor fouling is of paramount importance in maintaining the profitability of industries that use gas turbines as a source of power. The figure also shows the trends in gas power and gas thermal efficiency and these follow a similar trend to the gas turbine power output and gas turbine thermal efficiency.

# 13.1.6 Trends in flow

The trends in flow during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.6. The compressor inlet mass flow is observed to decrease and this is due to the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow during fouling. Since the compressor inlet pressure and temperature remain constant in this simulation, any decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow P results in a proportional decrease in compressor inlet mass flow, W¹√T¹/ W₁. Since the power loss due to compressor fouling is greater than the efficiency loss, the fuel flow decreases. The air–fuel ratio remains constant because the combustion system temperature rises and the compressor exit temperature remain essentially constant during fouling, as shown in Fig. 13.7.

# 13.1.7 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperature at the inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 13.7. The temperature trends remain essentially constant during compressor fouling for this case. Although the compressor pressure ratio decreases, the loss in compressor efficiency results in a near constant compressor exit temperature.

The choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine prevent the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. Thus the temperature ratio across the gas generator turbine is approximately constant as discussed in Section 8.1.2. Since the engine operates at a constant exhaust gas temperature, T₄, the turbine entry temperature, T₃ and the combustion temperature remain essentially constant.

As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant and there is only a small decrease in the power turbine pressure ratio that occurs during this transient, as shown in Fig. 13.3, the increase in the power turbine exit temperature is small.

# 13.1.8 Trends in speed

Figure 13.8 shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during compressor fouling. These speeds are observed to remain essentially constant during compressor fouling. This is because the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature limit and therefore there is no significant margin to increase or alter the speed during fouling.

Trends in turbine creep life

The trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.9. A slight decrease is observed in both the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage during compressor fouling. It was observed that the compressor mass flow decreases during

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

Compressor fouling and the compressor temperature rise is essentially constant. Thus the power absorbed by the compressor decreases during fouling. Since the compressor power is provided by the gas generator turbine, the gas generator turbine power also decreases during fouling. Thus the torque produced by the gas generator turbine blades will decrease. It was also observed that the gas generator speed and turbine temperatures remain essentially constant during fouling. The constant gas generator speed will result in a constant centrifugal stress, but the reduction in the torque acting on the turbine blade will result in a lower bending stress. The net effect reduces the stresses in the gas generator turbine blades and therefore decreases the gas generator turbine creep life usage.

The power turbine speed remains constant at 3000 RPM during the simulation. The decrease in power output from the gas turbine due to compressor fouling will therefore reduce the stress in the power turbine blades (lower torque). As the exhaust gas temperature remains constant during this simulation, the creep life usage of the power turbine also decreases due to the lower stresses that prevail in the power turbine blades. However, for a given exhaust gas temperature, compressor fouling results in reduced power output from the gas turbine and therefore, in real terms, there is an increase in creep life usage due to fouling. The reader can illustrate this by running the simulator at reduced power outputs typical of fouling, but when no compressor fouling is present.

# 13.1.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, and hence the combustion pressure, decreases during compressor fouling. However, the primary zone temperature remains constant during the simulation of fouling. Thus a decrease in NOx is observed during compressor fouling, due to the lower combustion pressure. The emission of CO, on the other hand, remains essentially constant, as the formation of CO is more sensitive to primary zone temperature than combustion pressure. These trends can be seen in Fig. ",How does compressor fouling affect gas turbine emissions?,"Fouling reduces NOx emissions due to lower combustion pressure, while CO emissions remain constant.",The text notes a decrease in NOx and stable CO levels as fouling lowers combustion pressure.,"Lower NOx emissions result from fouling's reduced combustion pressure, with CO emissions unaffected.","Fouling leads to diminished NOx because of decreased combustion pressure, leaving CO emissions unchanged.","NOx emissions drop with fouling's lower combustion pressure, whereas CO emissions stay the same."
