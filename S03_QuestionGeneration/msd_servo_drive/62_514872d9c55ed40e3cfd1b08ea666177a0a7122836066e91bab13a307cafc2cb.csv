As pressure increases, the compressibility of the fluid decreases, which means that less fluid is required to achieve the same pressure change. To maintain consistent dynamic performance of the pressure control circuit under varying pressure conditions, the gain of the pressure controller must be reduced at higher pressures. The characteristic curve allows for this gain scaling to be configured, ensuring that the pressure controller can effectively manage pressure changes while adapting to the specific conditions of the system.

This enables more precise control over the pressure in different operational scenarios, as each KpScale can be tailored to the specific requirements of the application.

By introducing this second KpScale, the system can dynamically adapt to varying conditions, ensuring that the pressure control remains effective even as the operational parameters change. The ability to write these KpScale values cyclically via the PDO (Process Data Object) channel means that the system can continuously update its control parameters in real-time, enhancing responsiveness and stability.

Furthermore, it is important to note that both KpScale factors influence each other, meaning that adjustments to one will affect the performance of the other.
