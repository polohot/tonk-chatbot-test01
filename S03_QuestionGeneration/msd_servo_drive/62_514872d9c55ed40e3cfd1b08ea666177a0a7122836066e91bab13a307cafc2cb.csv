Pumped for the same pressure change. Accordingly, the pressure controller’s gain needs to be reduced at higher pressures in order to maintain a constant pressure control circuit dynamic performance. Because of this, pressure-dependent controller gain scaling has also been incorporated. This scaling can be configured with a characteristic curve (P 2853 - HYD_PressConScale).

The pressure controller settings were duplicated in P 2874 HYD_PressCon2. With this it is possible to select a different controller setting for a selected table motion block. The second controller data set can be selected in the table motion block using P 2863 HYD_TabCtr bit 12.

In order to provide feedback to a higher-order control system, a setpoint window for “Pressure reached” (Para 2850.9 - PressWindow) can be specified. If the actual value is within this window, the bit “InWindow” (bit 13) is set in the status word (see also section ""Hydraulic Motion profile"" on page 190).

Furthermore, a second KpScale P 2879[0] PressCon1_KpScalePDO, P 2879[1] PressCon2_KpScalePDO has been introduced for operation via one controller and it can be written cyclically via the PDO channel. It should be noted here that both factors act one after the other and influence each other.

If there are stricter requirements concerning the volumetric flow rate accuracy, QLeak must be taken into account as a function of pressure and nRefPump must be increased accordingly.

In addition, limiting the pressure upwards to a maximum pressure of pmax is usually a requirement. ",How does compressibility change with increasing pressure according to the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' document?,"Compressibility decreases as pressure increases, meaning less fluid is needed for the same pressure change.","The document states that with higher pressures, compressibility will decrease, reducing the amount of fluid required for identical pressure changes.","As per 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp', increasing pressure leads to a decrease in compressibility, thus less fluid pumping is needed for the same pressure adjustment.","In the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp', it's explained that compressibility diminishes with rising pressure, requiring less fluid to achieve equivalent pressure variations.","The 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' indicates a reduction in compressibility as pressure goes up, resulting in decreased fluid necessity for similar pressure changes."

# 7.11.8.1 Volumetric flow rate control with pressure limitation

If the reference variable for the volumetric flow rate that needs to be set is QRefInput, the implemented volumetric flow rate control can be used. Generally, QRefInput can be converted to an equivalent motor setpoint speed nRefPump using the displacement volume and QLeak can be disregarded during the process.

If there are stricter requirements concerning the volumetric flow rate accuracy, QLeak must be taken into account as a function of pressure and nRefPump must be increased accordingly.

In addition, limiting the pressure upwards to a maximum pressure of pmax is usually a requirement.

Pumped for the same pressure change. Accordingly, the pressure controller’s gain needs to be reduced at higher pressures in order to maintain a constant pressure control circuit dynamic performance. Because of this, pressure-dependent controller gain scaling has also been incorporated. This scaling can be configured with a characteristic curve (P 2853 - HYD_PressConScale).

The pressure controller settings were duplicated in P 2874 HYD_PressCon2. With this it is possible to select a different controller setting for a selected table motion block. The second controller data set can be selected in the table motion block using P 2863 HYD_TabCtr bit 12.

In order to provide feedback to a higher-order control system, a setpoint window for “Pressure reached” (Para 2850.9 - PressWindow) can be specified. If the actual value is within this window, the bit “InWindow” (bit 13) is set in the status word (see also section ""Hydraulic Motion profile"" on page 190).

Furthermore, a second KpScale P 2879[0] PressCon1_KpScalePDO, P 2879[1] PressCon2_KpScalePDO has been introduced for operation via one controller and it can be written cyclically via the PDO channel. It should be noted here that both factors act one after the other and influence each other.

If there are stricter requirements concerning the volumetric flow rate accuracy, QLeak must be taken into account as a function of pressure and nRefPump must be increased accordingly.

In addition, limiting the pressure upwards to a maximum pressure of pmax is usually a requirement. ",How is volumetric flow rate control with pressure limitation described in the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp'?,"It uses QRefInput as the reference variable, converting it to nRefPump, with pressure limited to pmax.","The control takes QRefInput as the reference, translates it to pump speed setpoint nRefPump, and limits pressure to a maximum pmax.","By employing QRefInput for volumetric flow rate reference, converting it to nRefPump, and capping the pressure at pmax.","The document describes a system where QRefInput dictates the flow rate, converted into pump speed nRefPump, with an upper pressure limit of pmax.","Volumetric flow rate control involves using QRefInput to determine nRefPump, while ensuring pressure does not exceed the specified pmax limit."
