1. At 0 Hertz, the boost voltage is set to a fixed value defined by the parameter P 313[0] - CON_VFC_VBoost. This means that when the frequency is zero, the output voltage will be at this boost voltage level.

2. As the frequency increases and reaches the nominal frequency (defined by P 314[0] - CON_VFC_FNom), the output voltage remains constant at the nominal voltage level specified by P 315[0] - CON_VFC_VNom.

3. Beyond the nominal frequency, the system will automatically drive the asynchronous motor into field weakening, which implies that the output voltage may not increase further with increasing frequency, as it is designed to maintain a constant voltage up to the nominal frequency.

In summary, the output voltage is constant at the boost voltage at 0 Hz, remains constant at the nominal voltage at the nominal frequency, and does not increase further as frequency rises beyond the nominal frequency."

The documentation indicates that the actual position is expressed in user units, which implies that the normalized value can be mapped or scaled to fit the specific measurement units that a user may require for their application. 

Therefore, the actual position normalized parameter serves as a bridge between the raw position data and the user-defined measurement system, allowing for flexibility in how the position is represented and utilized within the MSD ServoDrive system."

1. **Additive Torque Reference (REFTORQUE)**: This setting allows the process controller to add a torque value to the existing torque command. It is used to adjust the torque output of the drive, which can be critical for applications requiring precise torque control, such as in robotic arms or conveyor systems where the load may vary.

2. **Additive Speed Reference Value (REFVEL)**: This setting, on the other hand, adds a speed value to the existing speed command. It is used to adjust the speed of the drive, which is important for applications where maintaining or changing speed is crucial, such as in motors driving fans or pumps.

In summary, the key difference lies in their application: the additive torque reference modifies the torque output, while the additive speed reference modifies the speed output of the process controller."

1. **Additive Torque Reference (REFTORQUE)** - This would typically be in units of torque (e.g., Nm).
2. **Additive Speed Reference Value (REFVEL)** - This would be in units of speed (e.g., RPM or m/s).
3. **Additive Position Reference (REFPOS)** - This would be in units of position (e.g., meters or degrees).
4. **Additive Speed Setpoint on Ramp (REFVEL_RAMP)** - This would also be in units of speed (e.g., RPM or m/s).

The exact internal units used for these parameters should be gathered from the configured user units, as mentioned in the context information."

This signifies that when the integral-action time is set to this maximum value, the I-component of the PI controller becomes inactive, meaning that the integral part of the controller will not contribute to the control action."

The limitation can be parameterized using the following parameters:

- P 2663[0] - CON_PRC_LIMPOS for setting the positive limit.
- P 2664[0] - CON_PRC_LIMNEG for setting the negative limit.

This ensures that the output of the process controller is constrained within the specified limits after the offset has been applied."

It allows for the parameterization of the steepness of the control variable per millisecond. This means that it can control how quickly the manipulated variable can change over time, which helps to prevent abrupt changes that could destabilize the system. Subindex 0 is for standard process controller operation, while subindex 1 is specifically for reducing the process controller’s integral term."

This parameter allows users to map the manipulated variable downstream of the rate limiter (P 2676[0] - CON_PRC_OUTVAL) to various internal drive setpoint or feed-forward control values.

When the user selects the reference value for MotionProfile, they would choose option 4 (MPPRO) from the available settings. This option corresponds to the reference value for MotionProfile, which is further specified by parameter P 2678[0] - CON_OUTSEL_MOPRO. 

It is crucial to ensure that when selecting the additive setpoints (including the MotionProfile reference), they are properly connected to the respective positions in the control structure using internal units. The conversion details for translating these internal units to user-specific units must be obtained from the configured user units, ensuring that the process controller operates correctly with the desired motion profile settings."

This means that it defines the maximum value that the controller can output after the control variable has been processed through the controller and any adjustments (such as offsets) have been made. By parameterizing this limit, users can ensure that the control actions do not exceed a certain threshold, which is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing potential damage to the system or its components. Properly setting this limit helps in achieving desired performance while avoiding excessive control actions that could lead to instability or undesirable behavior in the system."

This implies that there is a defined mapping or conversion process that needs to be referenced in order to accurately interpret the internal units in a way that is meaningful for users. However, the specific details of this conversion process are not provided in the context, suggesting that users need to consult additional documentation or configuration settings to understand how to perform the conversion."

Specifically, when the integral term reduction is activated (using subindex 1 of the field parameter P 2680 - CON_PRC_RateLimiter), it limits the rate at which the integral component of the controller can change. This can help prevent excessive overshoot or oscillations in the control response by ensuring that the adjustments to the integral term are more gradual. As a result, it can enhance the stability and performance of the control system, particularly in situations where rapid changes in the control variable might lead to instability or undesirable behavior."
