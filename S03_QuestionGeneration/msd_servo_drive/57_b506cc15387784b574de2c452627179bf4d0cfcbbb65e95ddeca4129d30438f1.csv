Specifically, this activation leads to the delivery of an additive position reference value by the process controller, which is then subject to the limitations imposed by the rate limiter. This means that the control variable change, which affects the speed of the motor shaft, will be restricted according to the parameters set for the rate limiter. Consequently, the speed change on the motor shaft will be controlled more tightly, preventing abrupt changes and ensuring smoother operation."

Specifically, the process controller adjusts the control variable to change the speed on the motor shaft, with a limitation on how much this change can occur within a given time interval. For instance, if the control variable change is limited to a maximum of 100 revolutions per minute (rpm), this means that the process controller will adjust the speed of the motor shaft accordingly, ensuring that the change does not exceed this limit. The rate limiter parameter (P 2680[0] - CON_PRC_Rate Limiter) is used to define the maximum allowable change in the control variable per millisecond, which in turn regulates the speed change on the motor shaft.

1. **Reduced Overshoot**: A lower I-component can help minimize the overshoot of the control variable, leading to a more stable response when the setpoint changes.

2. **Faster Settling Time**: By reducing the influence of the integral action, the system may reach the desired setpoint more quickly, as it will not accumulate excessive error over time.

3. **Decreased Steady-State Error**: While a reduced I-component can help with stability, it may also increase the steady-state error if the system is not adequately tuned, as the integral action is responsible for eliminating persistent errors.

4. **Less Oscillation**: A smaller I-component can reduce oscillations in the control output, leading to smoother operation of the actuator.

5. **Improved System Responsiveness**: The system may respond more promptly to changes in the reference value, as the integral action will not dominate the control output.

By adjusting this scaling factor, you can influence how aggressively the control system reacts to deviations from the setpoint.

1. **Gain Adjustment**: The scaling factor modifies the proportional gain (Kp) of the process controller. A higher scaling factor increases the gain, making the system more responsive to errors. Conversely, a lower scaling factor reduces the gain, resulting in a slower response.

2. **Stability**: While increasing the gain can improve the speed of response, it can also lead to instability if set too high. This can cause oscillations or overshoot in the system's output. Therefore, careful tuning of the scaling factor is essential to maintain a balance between responsiveness and stability.

3. **Control Precision**: The scaling factor affects the precision of the control action. An appropriately set scaling factor allows for finer control over the actuator's output, leading to more accurate tracking of the desired setpoint.

4. **Integration with Other Parameters**: The scaling factor interacts with other parameters, such as the integral action time (P 2661[0] - CON_PRC_Tn) and rate limiting (P 2680[0] - CON_PRC_RateLimiter). Adjustments to the scaling factor may necessitate re-evaluation of these parameters to ensure optimal performance.

In summary, the scaling factor for the process controller gain is a critical parameter that influences the control system's responsiveness, stability, and precision. Proper tuning is essential for achieving desired performance outcomes."

It is specifically designed to manage how quickly the control signal can change, which can help in stabilizing the system and preventing excessive oscillations or overshoot in response to changes in the setpoint or external disturbances.

The control deviation, represented by P 2675 - CON_PRC_CDIFF, is the difference between the desired setpoint and the actual value of the process variable. If the control deviation is large, the process controller will attempt to adjust the output to minimize this difference. However, without a rate limiter, the output could change too rapidly, potentially leading to instability in the system.

By parameterizing the CON_PRC_RateLimiter, the system can ensure that changes to the control output occur at a controlled rate, which helps to smooth out the response to changes in the control deviation. This is particularly important in systems where rapid changes can cause mechanical stress or instability. Therefore, the CON_PRC_RateLimiter plays a crucial role in managing the relationship between the control deviation and the overall system stability by moderating how quickly the control output can respond to changes in that deviation."

In the formula provided, the total torque \( M \) at the pump is expressed as:

\[ M = \frac{V_g}{2\pi} \cdot p + (M_{friction}) \]

This indicates that the torque required to overcome the pressure \( p \) (derived from the geometric displacement volume \( V_g \)) is added to the friction torque. However, it is noted that the friction torque is typically unknown and often considered negligible, with an approximation of \( M_{friction} \sim 0 \). Therefore, for practical calculations, the total torque is primarily determined by the torque associated with the pressure and the displacement volume, while the friction torque can usually be disregarded unless it is significant in a specific application."

1. **Inaccurate Flow Rate Calculations**: Without the leakage volume rate constant, it becomes challenging to accurately determine the internal pump leakage volumetric flow rate (Q_L). This can lead to errors in calculating the actual volumetric flow rate (Q), as the formula for Q requires subtracting Q_L from the theoretical flow rate (Q_th).

2. **Reliance on Volumetric Efficiency**: Users must rely on the specified volumetric efficiency (η_vol,N) at the pump's rated point to estimate performance. This can introduce uncertainty, as volumetric efficiency may not fully account for all operational conditions, particularly if the pump operates outside its rated point.

3. **Potential for Overestimation of Performance**: If users do not account for leakage, they may overestimate the pump's performance, leading to inadequate system design or operational issues, such as insufficient flow rates for the intended application.

4. **Difficulty in Control and Optimization**: The absence of a leakage rate constant can complicate the control of the pump's operation, as the control system may not have the necessary data to optimize performance or compensate for losses due to leakage.

5. **Increased Risk of System Failures**: Inaccurate calculations and assumptions about pump performance can lead to system inefficiencies or failures, as the actual performance may not meet the requirements of the application.

Overall, not specifying the leakage volume rate constant can hinder effective pump selection, control, and performance optimization, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs."

However, it is important to note that only one of these two values should be set at a time. When one value is set, the other will be automatically calculated based on the provided information.

The consequence of setting both values simultaneously is that it may lead to conflicting data, as the system is designed to use either the displacement volume or the torque constant for calculations, not both. This could result in incorrect operation or control of the pump, as the internal calculations for parameters such as volumetric flow rate and leakage volumetric flow rate rely on consistent and singular input values. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that only one of the two parameters is specified to maintain proper functionality and accuracy in the system's performance."

- \( n_N \) is the speed of the pump at its rated point (in revolutions per minute).
- \( \eta_{(Vol,N)} \) is the volumetric efficiency at the pump’s rating point (expressed as a percentage).

In this formula, the volumetric efficiency \( \eta_{(Vol,N)} \) accounts for the effectiveness of the pump in converting the geometric displacement into actual flow.

1. **Measure the Built-up Pressure**: Obtain the pressure \( p \) from the pressure sensor when the pump is running against a constant load.

2. **Measure the Delivered Motor Torque**: Record the mean value of the motor torque \( M \) while the pump is operating at the built-up pressure.

3. **Calculate the Torque Constant**: Use the formula for the torque constant \( c_M \):
   \[
   c_M = \frac{M}{p}
   \]
   where \( M \) is the motor torque in Nm and \( p \) is the pressure in bar.

4. **Relate Torque Constant to Displacement Volume**: The torque constant can also be expressed in terms of the displacement volume:

The volumetric efficiency indicates how effectively the pump converts the input energy into useful flow, accounting for internal losses due to leakage.

Here's how it works:

1. **Theoretical Flow Rate Calculation**: The theoretical volumetric flow rate (Q_th) is calculated based on the geometric displacement volume (V_g) and the speed of the pump (n):
   - \( Q_{th} = V_g \cdot n \)

2. **Actual Flow Rate Adjustment**: The actual volumetric flow rate (Q) is then determined by subtracting the internal pump leakage volumetric flow rate (Q_L) from the theoretical flow rate:
   - \( Q = Q_{th} - Q_L \)

3. **Leakage Flow Rate Calculation**: The internal leakage flow rate (Q_L) is typically proportional to the pressure and can be expressed using the leakage volume rate constant (k_L) and the pressure (p):
   - \( Q_L = p \cdot k_L(\vartheta) \)

4. **Incorporating Volumetric Efficiency**: If the leakage volume rate constant is not specified, the control system uses the volumetric efficiency at the pump’s rated point to calculate the actual flow rate at that point:
   - \( Q_N = V_g \cdot n_N \cdot \eta_{(Vol,N)} \)
   - This means that the actual flow rate at the rated speed (n_N) is directly influenced by the volumetric efficiency, allowing the control system to manage flow rates more accurately.

5. **Control System Implementation**: The control system uses the calculated actual flow rate (Q) to adjust the operation of the pump, ensuring that it operates within the specified speed limits and maintains the desired performance based on the set parameters.

In summary, the control system leverages the volumetric efficiency at the pump’s rating point to accurately calculate and manage the actual volumetric flow rate, compensating for internal losses and ensuring optimal pump performance."

The control system allows the pump to operate below the critical minimum speed for a limited time, which is determined by the pressure and the speed. Specifically, the tolerable duration decreases as the speed decreases. 

For instance, if the pump operates at half the critical speed, it can only run for twice the critical duration before reaching a critical limit integral (i_G). This integral accounts for the power loss, which has a quadratic relationship to the pressure, and the heat removal, which is proportional to the speed. 

In summary, as the pump speed decreases, the maximum allowable duration at that speed increases quadratically with respect to the pressure, meaning that lower speeds can only be tolerated for shorter periods, especially under higher pressures. If the critical limit is reached, a bypass may be opened to increase speed, and if the limit is exceeded, an error will be triggered, stopping the drive to protect the pump."

The critical limit integral (l i_G) is continuously calculated in the servo drive to monitor the relationship between pressure and speed, which affects heat removal and power loss. If the pump operates below the critical speed for too long, it can lead to overheating and potential damage. Therefore, the critical minimum speed helps to prevent such situations by triggering protective measures, such as opening a bypass circuit or stopping the drive, if the specified limits are exceeded."

This is because the power loss is calculated based on the pressure, and since the pump is not moving, it cannot effectively remove heat. If i_G reaches 1.0, an error will be triggered, and the drive will be stopped to protect the pump from potential damage."

1. **Heat Generation**: At low speeds, the volumetric flow rate is reduced, which leads to inadequate heat removal. This can cause the pump to overheat, as the power loss associated with the pressure is approximately quadratic. If the pump operates below a critical minimum speed (n_crit) for too long, it can lead to overheating and potential damage.

2. **Critical Speed Limitations**: There is a critical minimum speed (n_crit) that must not be fallen below for a specified critical duration (t_crit) at nominal pressure (p_N). If the pump operates below this critical speed for longer than the allowed duration, it can trigger protective measures, such as opening a bypass circuit to increase speed or stopping the drive altogether if the situation does not improve.

3. **Pressure Relationship**: The relationship between pressure and permissible operation time is quadratic. For example, if the nominal pressure is maintained while the speed is low, the allowable operation time decreases significantly. At half the nominal pressure, the pump can only run for four times the critical duration compared to running at nominal pressure.

4. **Leakage Losses**: Operating at low speeds with high pressure can increase leakage losses, which also have a quadratic relationship to pressure. This can further exacerbate the inefficiencies and risks associated with low-speed operation.

5. **Potential for Errors**: If the conditions are not adjusted appropriately (e.g., if the bypass does not increase the speed), an error may be triggered, leading to a shutdown of the pump to protect it from damage.

Overall, running a pump at low speeds under high pressure requires careful monitoring and control to avoid overheating and ensure safe operation."

Specifically, they define the thresholds at which the bypass circuit opens and closes to manage the pump's speed and protect it from potential damage.

1. **Opening the Bypass Circuit**: When the critical limit integral (i_G) reaches a configurable limit (e.g., i_G = 0.9), the bypass circuit is opened. This action is intended to increase the pump speed, thereby enhancing heat removal and preventing overheating due to low speeds under high pressure.

2. **Closing the Bypass Circuit**: Once the pump speed increases and the integral value falls below a lower hysteresis threshold (e.g., i_G = 0.8), the bypass circuit closes again. This helps to reduce power loss and maintain efficiency.

The use of hysteresis prevents rapid cycling of the bypass circuit, which could lead to instability in the pump operation. By requiring the integral to fall below a lower threshold before closing the bypass, the system ensures that the pump operates within safe parameters without unnecessary fluctuations."

Specifically, the power loss associated with leakage increases with the square of the pressure. 

For example, if the nominal pressure is set at a certain level (e.g., 100 bar), the critical speed (n_crit) must not be fallen below for a specified critical duration (t_crit). If the pressure is halved (to 50 bar), the duration that the pump can run at a low speed is increased by a factor of four. This means that at lower pressures, the pump can tolerate being run at critical speeds for a longer time without exceeding the critical limit integral (i_G). 

Thus, the higher the pressure, the stricter the limits on how long the pump can operate at low speeds, as the relationship between pressure and permissible duration is quadratic. If the pressure is maintained at nominal levels, the pump can run continuously at the critical speed, but if the pressure decreases, the allowable time at critical speeds increases significantly."

Here's how they impact accuracy:

1. **Scaling Parameters**: 
   - Scaling parameters (e.g., `pAct_Scale`, `QRef_Scale`, `nRef_Scale`) adjust the raw sensor readings to convert them into meaningful units. If the scaling factors are not correctly set, the converted values may be inaccurate, leading to erroneous readings of pressure, flow rate, or pump speed. For instance, if a scaling factor is too low, the system may report lower values than actual, while a scaling factor that is too high may inflate the readings.

2. **Offset Parameters**: 
   - Offset parameters (e.g., `pAct_Offset`, `QRef_Offset`, `nRef_Offset`) are used to correct systematic errors in sensor readings. These offsets account for any inherent biases in the sensors, such as zero-point errors. If the offsets are incorrectly configured, it can lead to consistent deviations from the true values, which can significantly affect control decisions and system performance.

3. **Minimum and Maximum Values**: 
   - The minimum and maximum parameters (e.g., `pAct_Min`, `pAct_Max`, `QRef_Min`, `QRef_Max`) define the operational limits of the system. If these limits are set incorrectly, it can result in the system operating outside of safe or expected ranges, potentially leading to failures or inaccurate measurements. For example, if the maximum pressure is set too low, the system may not recognize high-pressure conditions that could indicate a fault.

4. **Overall Impact on Control**: 
   - Accurate scaling and offset settings are essential for the control algorithms that rely on these measurements to make real-time adjustments. If the measurements are inaccurate due to improper scaling or offsets, the control system may respond incorrectly, leading to inefficiencies, potential damage, or safety hazards.

In summary, proper configuration of scaling and offset parameters is vital for ensuring that hydraulic system measurements are accurate, which in turn supports effective control and operation of the system."

The system uses these values to control the hydraulic pressure: if pAct is below pRef, the system may increase the hydraulic pressure to reach the setpoint, and if pAct exceeds pRef, the system may reduce the pressure. The difference between these two values can be used to assess the performance of the hydraulic system and make necessary adjustments to maintain the desired operating conditions."

1. **Precision in Control**: Signal scaling parameters, such as scaling factors and offsets, allow for the accurate conversion of raw sensor data into meaningful values that can be used for control purposes. This ensures that the system responds appropriately to the actual conditions, improving the precision of hydraulic control.

2. **Customization**: By configuring parameters like minimum and maximum values, operators can tailor the hydraulic system's response to specific applications. This customization helps in optimizing performance and ensuring that the system operates within safe and efficient limits.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: The ability to scale and offset signals enables better monitoring of system performance. For instance, understanding the actual pressure and flow rates through parameters like `pAct`, `QAct`, and `nRef` allows operators to detect anomalies and make informed decisions about maintenance or adjustments.

4. **Improved Feedback Loop**: The scaling parameters facilitate the creation of effective feedback loops in control systems. By accurately reflecting the state of the hydraulic system, these parameters help in adjusting the control inputs dynamically, leading to smoother and more responsive operation.

5. **Error Reduction**: Properly scaled signals reduce the risk of errors that can arise from misinterpretation of sensor data. This is particularly important in applications where precise control is necessary, such as in robotics or automated manufacturing processes.

6. **Adaptability to Different Conditions**: Hydraulic systems often operate under varying conditions. By understanding and adjusting the signal scaling parameters, operators can ensure that the system adapts to changes in load, temperature, or other environmental factors, maintaining optimal performance.

This could occur in situations such as:

1. **Vacuum Systems**: In systems that operate under vacuum conditions, the pressure readings can be negative relative to atmospheric pressure.

2. **Fluid Dynamics**: In certain fluid dynamics applications, negative pressures might be encountered due to the flow characteristics or when measuring pressure drops across components.

3. **Hydraulic Systems with Pressure Drops**: If there are significant pressure drops in hydraulic systems, especially in cases of cavitation or when the system experiences a sudden change in flow conditions, negative pressure values may be recorded.

4. **Leak Detection**: In systems designed to detect leaks, negative pressure readings might indicate a drop in pressure due to a leak, necessitating the allowance for negative values in the parameter settings.

In these scenarios, allowing for negative values in the HYD_PressCon.pMin parameter ensures that the system can accurately reflect and respond to the actual operating conditions."

1. **Inaccurate Speed Control**: The nRef parameters define the set speed for the pump. If these parameters are not configured correctly, the actual speed of the pump may deviate from the desired speed, leading to inefficient operation and potential system instability.

2. **Pressure Fluctuations**: Since the pump speed directly influences the hydraulic pressure in the system, incorrect nRef settings can cause fluctuations in pressure. This can result in inadequate pressure for the hydraulic system to function effectively, potentially leading to equipment malfunction or failure.

3. **Flow Rate Issues**: The nRef parameters also affect the flow rate setpoints (QRef). Improper configuration can lead to incorrect flow rates, which may result in insufficient or excessive fluid delivery to the actuators, impacting the overall performance of the hydraulic system.

4. **Increased Wear and Tear**: Operating outside the intended speed range can lead to increased wear on hydraulic components, reducing their lifespan and increasing maintenance costs.

5. **Safety Risks**: In critical applications, incorrect speed settings can pose safety risks. For example, if the system operates at speeds that are too high, it may lead to uncontrolled movements or failures, endangering personnel and equipment.

6. **Control System Instability**: The overall control strategy may become unstable if the nRef parameters are not set correctly, leading to oscillations or erratic behavior in the hydraulic system.

7. **Inefficiency and Energy Waste**: A misconfigured nRef can lead to inefficient energy use, as the system may consume more power than necessary to achieve the desired performance, resulting in higher operational costs.

In summary, proper configuration of the nRef parameters is crucial for maintaining the efficiency, safety, and reliability of a hydraulic control system."
