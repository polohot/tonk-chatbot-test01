| |Splinell(3)|Cubic spline interpolation:| |Only on request from Moog.|
| |NonIPSpline(4)|Cubic spline approximation:| |In this method the interpolation points are approximated by means of B-splines. The trajectory normally does not run exactly through the points specified by the control. ",What is the purpose of interpolation in motion profile generation?,To create smooth trajectories between known points for precise motion control.,Interpolation ensures smooth transitions between points in motion profiles.,It's used to generate continuous paths from discrete points for accurate movement.,The goal is to achieve seamless motion by filling in between specified points.,Interpolation facilitates precise and smooth motion by connecting discrete points.
