Specifically, if the PeriodLen value is greater than 0, the system identifies the encoder as a linear encoder system. This is particularly relevant for Sin/Cos encoders with distance-coded reference marks. In contrast, if the PeriodLen is 0 or if the encoder does not have an absolute value interface, the system treats it as a rotary encoder. Thus, the value of PeriodLen plays a crucial role in the classification and functionality of the encoder system."

By default, CycleCount is set to 1, which corresponds to a sampling and cycle time of 125 microseconds (μs). If different settings for CycleCount are used, they must be considered as special cases and should only be applied when necessary, as they will alter the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation."

These parameters allow for the configuration of the encoder to work with such reference marks.

For example, if you are using a specific encoder model like the Heidenhain ROD280C, which has 18000 Sin/Cos tracks per revolution and 36 distance-coded reference marks, you would set NominalIncrementA to 1000 signal periods and NominalIncrementB to 1001 signal periods. This setup enables the system to correctly interpret the signals from the encoder and utilize the distance-coded reference marks for accurate positioning.

In summary, the functionality of these parameters is activated when NominalIncrementA is set to a value greater than 0, allowing the Sin/Cos incremental encoders to operate effectively with the distance-coded reference marks."

This could occur in scenarios where the standard 125 μs sampling rate is not suitable for the specific application requirements, such as when a slower or faster sampling rate is needed to achieve accurate encoder readings or to accommodate specific system dynamics. Adjustments should be made with caution and only when necessary, as indicated in the documentation."

Specifically, it indicates the duration of each sampling cycle in multiples of 125 microseconds (μs). By default, the CycleCount is set to 1, which means that the encoder is sampled every 125 μs. Adjusting the CycleCount can slow down the timing of the encoder evaluation, allowing for different settings based on specific requirements."

Specifically, if NominalIncrementA is set to a value greater than 0, it allows for the configuration of the encoder to utilize analog distance-coded reference marks. For example, in the case of using a specific encoder model (like the Heidenhain ROD280C), setting NominalIncrementA to a certain number of signal periods (e.g., 1000) in conjunction with NominalIncrementB (e.g., 1001) helps to define the relationship between the encoder's signal periods and the distance-coded reference marks. This functionality is crucial for accurately interpreting the position data from the encoder in applications where precise positioning is required."
