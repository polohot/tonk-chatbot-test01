- **RETABS(5)**: This function is similar to ""RET(1)"" but operates with absolute voltages and does not perform validation checks. It allows for the return of power to be detected based on absolute voltage levels.

- **NOLIM(3)**: This function enables the system to operate without detecting the return of power. It is specifically designed to not allow the detection of power return, meaning it does not monitor or respond to voltage levels.

In summary, RETABS(5) involves detecting power return using absolute voltages, while NOLIM(3) disables the detection of power return altogether."

Here's a breakdown of their significance:

1. **Gain (CON_POWF_VCtrl)**: This parameter determines the gain applied during power failure bridging. It affects how the system responds to voltage changes during a power failure, helping to stabilize the operation.

2. **Reset Time (Tn)**: This parameter specifies the time it takes for the system to reset after a power failure. A properly configured reset time ensures that the system can recover quickly and resume normal operation once power is restored.

3. **Maximum (Negative) Current (imax)**: This parameter sets the maximum allowable negative current during a power failure. It helps protect the system from excessive negative currents that could cause damage or instability.

4. **Maximum Positive Current (imax_pos)**: Similar to the negative current parameter, this sets the maximum allowable positive current during a power failure, ensuring that the system operates within safe limits.

5. **Minimum Speed for Voltage Controller (n_min)**: This parameter defines the minimum speed at which the voltage controller can operate during a power failure. It ensures that the system maintains a certain level of performance even under reduced power conditions.

6. **Voltage Limit for Power Failure (CON_POWF_VLim)**: This parameter establishes the voltage limit for power failure conditions, helping to protect the system from operating outside safe voltage ranges.

7. **Power Failure Detection Limit (POWF_VOn)**: This defines the threshold voltage level at which the system detects a power failure. It is critical for initiating protective measures when the voltage drops below this limit.

8. **Voltage Reference Value (POWF_VRef)**: This parameter indicates the reference voltage that the system should maintain. It is essential for ensuring that the configured values are appropriate for the system's operation.

9. **Time Window for Mains Power Restoration (CON_POWF_RetTime)**: This parameter sets the time window in which the system expects mains power to be restored. It helps in managing the response of the system during power interruptions.

10. **Undervoltage Threshold (u_zkoff)**: This parameter defines the voltage threshold below which the system considers the voltage to be too low (undervoltage), triggering protective actions.

11. **Braking Chopper Threshold (u_bc_on)**: This parameter sets the voltage level at which the braking chopper activates, helping to manage excess energy during power failure conditions.

1. **Error Triggering**: If the return of power is detected, an error will be triggered. This means that the system will not allow the operation to continue without addressing the error condition, which could halt processes or require manual intervention.

2. **Loss of Safety Mechanism**: By disabling the detection of return of power, the system may lose a critical safety mechanism that ensures safe operation during power fluctuations. This could lead to unexpected behavior or damage to the system if power is restored improperly.

3. **Operational Reliability**: The reliability of the system may be compromised, as it will not be able to respond appropriately to changes in power status. This could lead to operational issues, especially in environments where power stability is a concern.

4. **User Responsibility**: Users must ensure that the values entered for power failure detection limits and voltage setpoints are valid, as the system will not perform validation checks. This increases the risk of user error and potential system malfunction.

5. **Limited Monitoring**: The system may have limited monitoring capabilities regarding power conditions, which could hinder diagnostics and troubleshooting efforts if issues arise related to power supply.

Overall, enabling this function requires careful consideration of the operational environment and the potential risks associated with power management."
