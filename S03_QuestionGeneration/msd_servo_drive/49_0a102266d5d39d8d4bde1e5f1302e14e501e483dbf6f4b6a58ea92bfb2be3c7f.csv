1. **Fixed 32-bit Mapping**: This method involves an incremental input reference where the entire width of the 32-bit input position is mapped over the entire range of the input position. This means that the mapping is consistent and fixed, allowing for a straightforward interpretation of the input values across their full range.

2. **Rotary Recurring Position**: In this approach, the input reference is treated as a rotary position that recurs. However, it is important to note that entries into the teach table are only made in the positive direction of travel. In the negative direction, all entries into the teach table are suppressed, which means that the system does not record or respond to negative input values in this context.

These two methods provide flexibility in how input references are handled, allowing for different operational requirements and behaviors in the servo drive system."

1. **Teaching**: This function allows the system to learn and record the relationship between input positions and desired output values. It involves creating and populating teaching tables (small and large) with data that reflects the system's behavior in the positive direction of travel. This data is crucial for establishing a baseline for how the servo drive should respond to various inputs.

2. **Calculating**: The calculating functions (F1 and F2) utilize the data from the teaching tables to determine the appropriate output values for the compensation tables. This step involves processing the recorded data to ensure that the servo drive can accurately replicate the desired movements based on the input positions.

3. **Compensation**: The compensation functions use the calculated values to adjust the servo drive's output in real-time, ensuring that it operates smoothly and accurately. This is particularly important for correcting any discrepancies that may arise due to system dynamics, wear, or other factors that could affect performance.

Here's how they interact:

1. **Teaching Routine**: The teaching routine is responsible for populating the teach tables with data based on the servo drive's operation. There are two tables involved: a small teach table with 250 elements and a large teach table with 4000 elements. The entries in the teach table are made only in the positive direction of travel, while entries in the negative direction are suppressed.

2. **Compensation Table**: The compensation table is used to adjust the output values based on the data collected during the teaching routine. It consists of two tables as well: a small compensation table (250 elements) and a large compensation table (4000 elements). The compensation table is utilized to interpolate values that help in correcting the servo drive's performance during operation.

3. **Data Flow**: During the teaching routine, the system calculates the current table index using the input position, which is outputted as P 440[0] - CON_TAB_TabIndex. This index indicates which entry in the teach table is currently being referenced. The output value from the teach table is then displayed as P 446[0] - CON_TAB_OutVal.

4. **Compensation Process**: Once the teaching routine has populated the teach tables, the compensation process can use these values to adjust the servo drive's control signals. The compensation table is accessed to retrieve the interpolated values that correspond to the current position of the servo drive, which helps in fine-tuning the control output for better accuracy.

5. **Functions**: There are specific functions (F1 and F2) for calculating and compensating based on the teach tables. F1 handles rotary movements from the small teach table to the small compensation table, while F2 deals with absolute movements from the large teach table to the large compensation table.

6. **Resetting Tables**: The system also has a reset function that can clear the entries in the teach tables, allowing for a fresh start in the teaching process.

In summary, the teaching routine gathers data to fill the teach tables, which are then used to inform the compensation tables. This interaction ensures that the servo drive can operate more accurately by adjusting its outputs based on previously learned behaviors."

Here’s how it works:

1. **Open Manual Mode**: The process begins by opening the manual mode window.

2. **Set Up Control Parameters**: The user sets the speed control mode for high rigidity and smooth running, and may also set the teaching direction, offset, delta, and input tuning parameters as needed.

3. **Start Control**: The control is started, and the motor is run at a low speed (≤ 1 rpm).

4. **Activate Teaching**: The position source for teaching is selected by setting the appropriate parameter (P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon) to one of the teaching modes, such as TeachEpsRS or TeachUserRefPos.

5. **Complete Motor Revolution**: The user waits until at least one motor revolution is completed during the teaching routine, which includes an internal filter time.

6. **Stop Teaching and Import Values**: The teaching is stopped by calling a calculation function (P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = (3)CALC1). This action imports all the values collected during the teaching process into the compensation table (P 380 - CON_TCoggAddTab), specifically into the small table with 250 elements.

7. **Start Compensation**: After importing the values, the compensation is initiated (P 382[0] - CON_TCoggComp = (1)EPSRS), which activates the q-current feed forward control when the control is restarted.

8. **Save Device Data**: Finally, the position source used during teaching is saved for future compensation processes.
