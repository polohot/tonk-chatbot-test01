In the event of a single-phase failure of the device supply, e.g. a burned-out non-renewable fuse, the DC link voltage is maintained and the device continues to operate for the time being. However, the input rectifier can be damaged at a high output power.

The single-phase power failure detection is set with P 737[0] MON_MNCTL - bit 3 = 1.
