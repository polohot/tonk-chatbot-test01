This measurement is represented by parameter P 701[28] - VDC Variance. To set an appropriate monitoring threshold, it is recommended to measure the VDC Variance value at maximum output power and proper operation, and then use about 5-10 times that measured value as the monitoring threshold. If the variance exceeds the threshold value defined by P 760[2] - MON_VDC_Guard - MaxVar for the duration specified by P 760[3] - MON_VDC_Guard - Max_time, the monitoring will trigger an alert."

However, there is a risk that the input rectifier could be damaged if the device is operating at a high output power. The monitoring system detects this failure by calculating the quadratic ripple (variance) of the DC link voltage, and if this variance exceeds a specified threshold for a certain duration, the monitoring is triggered, leading to an error indication (error 54-1, Emergency code 6100h)."

This is due to the fact that, although the DC link voltage is maintained and the device continues to operate temporarily, the high output power can lead to conditions that may harm the rectifier."

This enables the detection of a single-phase failure of the device supply.
msd_servo_drive.txt,9,cf24e707f4ce3dc214371342f12e1493b99f469ea83f0a9395fe4c8a33083527,What is the significance of the quadratic ripple in the DC link voltage monitoring?,"The significance of the quadratic ripple (variance) in the DC link voltage monitoring is that it serves as an indicator of potential issues with the power supply, specifically in the context of single-phase failures. The variance is calculated to detect abnormal fluctuations in the DC link voltage, which can occur when there is a failure, such as a burned-out fuse. 

If the calculated variance exceeds a predefined threshold (MaxVar), and this condition persists for a specified duration (Max_time), it triggers monitoring that can lead to an error indication (error 54-1, Emergency code 6100h). This monitoring helps ensure that the device can respond appropriately to power supply issues, thereby preventing potential damage to the input rectifier and ensuring continued operation under certain failure conditions. The variance value is also used to set a monitoring threshold based on measurements taken during normal operation, ensuring that the system is sensitive enough to detect genuine problems while avoiding false alarms."

Specifically, the two time constants mentioned are:

1. **Tfilt_av (Filter time constant for average)**: This constant is used to calculate the average value of the DC link voltage over a specified period. It helps to stabilize the measurement by filtering out short-term fluctuations and providing a more accurate representation of the average voltage.

2. **Tfilt_var (Filter time constant for variance)**: This constant is used to calculate the variance of the DC link voltage. It helps to determine the stability of the voltage by assessing how much the voltage deviates from its average value over time. A stable variance indicates that the voltage is within acceptable limits, while a high variance may signal potential issues, such as a single-phase failure.

Together, these filter time constants ensure that the monitoring system can effectively detect significant changes in the DC link voltage while minimizing the impact of transient disturbances."

Specifically, if the quadratic ripple (variance) of the DC link voltage exceeds the threshold value defined by P 760[2] - MON_VDC_Guard - MaxVar for the duration specified by P 760[3] - MON_VDC_Guard - Max_time, the monitoring system activates and triggers error 54-1, which corresponds to emergency code 6100h."
msd_servo_drive.txt,9,cf24e707f4ce3dc214371342f12e1493b99f469ea83f0a9395fe4c8a33083527,What is the role of the monitoring control word in the context of single-phase failure detection?,"In the context of single-phase failure detection, the monitoring control word (MON_MNCTL) plays a crucial role in enabling and configuring the monitoring system for the device's power supply. Specifically, it allows for the detection of a single-phase failure, such as a burned-out non-renewable fuse. 

To set up the detection, the parameter P 737[0] MON_MNCTL must have bit 3 set to 1. This configuration activates the monitoring system, which then calculates the quadratic ripple (variance) of the DC link voltage. If this variance exceeds a predefined threshold for a specified duration, the monitoring system triggers an alert, indicating a potential issue with the power supply. 

In summary, the monitoring control word is essential for enabling the detection mechanism that safeguards the device against damage due to single-phase power failures."

If a single-phase failure occurs, such as a burned-out fuse, the device can still operate temporarily as the DC link voltage is maintained. However, this situation poses a risk of damaging the input rectifier if the output power is high.

To detect a single-phase power failure, the monitoring control is set using parameter P 737[0] (MON_MNCTL) with bit 3 enabled. The system calculates the variance of the DC link voltage and compares it against a predefined threshold value (MaxVar), which is set using parameter P 760[2] (MON_VDC_Guard). If the variance exceeds this threshold for a specified duration (Max_time), set by parameter P 760[3], the monitoring system triggers an alert.

The actual variance value is monitored and can be observed in parameter P 701[28] (VDC Variance). For effective monitoring, this threshold is typically set to 5-10 times the measured variance value during normal operation at maximum output power. If the monitoring system detects that the variance exceeds the threshold for the specified time, it triggers an error (error 54-1, Emergency code 6100h), thereby alerting the user to the potential issue and ensuring that appropriate safety measures can be taken to protect the device."

1. **P 701[28] - VDC_Variance**: This parameter measures the DC voltage variance (in V²).
2. **P 760 - MON_VDC_Guard**: This parameter includes several settings related to monitoring the DC link voltage:
   - **P 760[0] - Tfilt_av**: Filter time constant for average (in ms).
   - **P 760[1] - Tfilt_var**: Filter time constant for variance (in ms).
   - **P 760[2] - Max_var**: Maximum allowed variance (in V²).
   - **P 760[3] - Max_time**: Maximum time with variance threshold exceeded (in seconds).
   - **P 760[4] - Check_time**: Interval to check return of failed phase (in seconds).

3. **P 737[0] - MON_MNCTL**: This parameter is the monitoring control word, where bit 3 is set to 1 to enable single-phase power failure detection.

These parameters work together to monitor the DC link voltage and trigger alerts if certain thresholds are exceeded."

It indicates whether the monitoring functions, such as voltage variance detection and single-phase failure detection, are active and functioning correctly. This status word helps in diagnosing the operational state of the device and can signal any issues that may arise, such as exceeding the voltage variance threshold or detecting a single-phase failure."

This parameter allows the system to smooth out fluctuations in the DC link voltage readings over time, providing a stable average value that reflects the voltage level. The system continuously applies this filter to the incoming voltage data to calculate the average DC link voltage, ensuring that transient spikes or dips do not significantly affect the reported average."
