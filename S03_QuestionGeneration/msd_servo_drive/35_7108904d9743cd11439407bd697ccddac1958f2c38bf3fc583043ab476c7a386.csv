The first step in commissioning sensorless control is correctly determining the motor data and control parameters and configuring them accordingly. At this point, it is especially important to ensure that the inductance difference between the motor’s d and q axes is set correctly. This can be done with P 480[0] - MOT_Lsq. If this parameter is not available (older firmware), P 472[0] - MOT_LsigDiff can be used to set the difference as a percentage.

In order to obtain an accurate number, the values for the d and q inductances should:

- Be obtained from the motor manufacturer’s data sheet or the motor data set OR
- Be requested from the motor manufacturer OR
- Be measured by Moog with an “advanced motor identification” routine OR
- Be determined as an approximation for most motors with the motor identification routine

If none of these options is available, it is possible to start with a rough setting of Lq = 110% • Ld for a test with a servomotor. However, you must then be ready for limited operation within a narrow speed range.
