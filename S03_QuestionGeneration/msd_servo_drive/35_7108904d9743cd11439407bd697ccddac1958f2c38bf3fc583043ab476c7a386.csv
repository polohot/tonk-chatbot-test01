It is calculated by determining the angular change between two predicted angular positions from consecutive sampling steps. By dividing this angular difference (eps_diff) by the observer’s sampling time, the speed (n_eps) is obtained. Although this method yields a noisier speed measurement compared to the speed calculated by a Kalman filter, it is considered accurate in steady-state conditions. However, the presence of heavy noise necessitates longer filter times, which can compromise the dynamic performance of the control circuit. To enhance both dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy, a control scheme is implemented that combines the speed from the angular derivative (n_eps) with the speed from the Kalman filter (n_kal)."

This means that eps_diff represents the angular change between two predicted angular positions from consecutive sampling steps, and when this change is divided by the time interval (sampling time) between those steps, it yields the speed. However, it is noted that this method of calculating speed is noisier compared to the speed derived from a Kalman filter, which can affect the control circuit's dynamic performance."

This method can be sensitive to fluctuations and disturbances in the measurements, leading to higher variability and noise in the speed estimation. In contrast, the Kalman filter incorporates a statistical approach that combines multiple measurements over time, effectively filtering out noise and providing a smoother and more accurate speed estimate, especially in dynamic conditions."

1. **Loss of Dynamic Performance**: Longer filter times can reduce the responsiveness of the control system. This means that the system may react more slowly to changes in input or disturbances, which can be detrimental in applications requiring quick adjustments.

2. **Increased Steady-State Accuracy**: While longer filter times may improve steady-state accuracy by smoothing out noise, this benefit comes at the cost of dynamic performance. The system may be more stable in steady-state conditions but less capable of handling rapid changes.

3. **Increased Noise Sensitivity**: Although the longer filter times can help in averaging out noise, they can also make the system more sensitive to noise during transient states, potentially leading to oscillations or instability.

4. **Reduced Control Precision**: With longer filter times, the control circuit may not be able to track the desired setpoint accurately during dynamic changes, leading to a decrease in overall control precision.

5. **Potential for Overshoot**: The slower response can cause the system to overshoot the desired position or speed, as it may take longer to correct for deviations from the setpoint.

In summary, while longer filter times can enhance steady-state performance, they can significantly compromise the dynamic response and overall effectiveness of the control circuit in real-time applications."

The angular derivative speed provides quick responses to changes in the system, making it useful for dynamic performance, while the Kalman filter speed offers improved accuracy and stability in steady-state conditions.

By integrating both speed values, the control scheme can achieve high dynamic performance while maintaining steady-state accuracy. The angular derivative speed can react swiftly to changes, helping to manage rapid fluctuations, while the Kalman filter speed can smooth out noise and provide a more reliable estimate over time. This dual approach allows for more effective control of the system, minimizing the impact of noise and improving overall responsiveness and stability."

1. **Reduced Responsiveness**: Noise in speed measurements can lead to delays in the control system's response to changes in the system's state. When the speed data is noisy, the control algorithm may react too slowly or inaccurately to the actual conditions, resulting in sluggish performance.

2. **Increased Filter Times**: To mitigate the effects of noise, longer filter times are often required. While this can improve the accuracy of the speed measurements, it can also introduce lag in the control system, further diminishing its dynamic performance.

3. **Loss of Control Precision**: High levels of noise can obscure the true speed of the system, making it difficult for the control algorithm to maintain precise control. This can lead to oscillations or instability in the system, particularly during rapid changes in speed or direction.

4. **Compromised Steady-State Accuracy**: Although the noisy speed measurement may be accurate in steady-state conditions, the presence of noise can still affect the overall performance during transient conditions, leading to a compromise in the control circuit's ability to maintain desired performance levels.

5. **Complex Control Strategies**: The need to handle noise may require more complex control strategies, such as the integration of multiple speed values (e.g., from angular derivatives and Kalman filters), which can complicate the control algorithm and potentially introduce additional points of failure.

In summary, noise in speed measurements can lead to a reduction in responsiveness, increased filter times, loss of precision, compromised steady-state accuracy, and the need for more complex control strategies, all of which can negatively impact the dynamic performance of a control circuit."
