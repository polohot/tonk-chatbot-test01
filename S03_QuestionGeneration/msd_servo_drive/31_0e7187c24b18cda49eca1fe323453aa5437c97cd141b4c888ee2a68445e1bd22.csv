- **ENC_CH3_PeriodLen**: This parameter represents the length of an analog Sin/Cos signal period in nanometres. It is specifically used for linear EnDat encoders.

- **ENC_CH3_DigitalResolution**: This parameter indicates the length of a digital increment of the position from the absolute value interface, also measured in nanometres. It is used in conjunction with linear absolute encoders.

Both parameters are essential for the operation of linear EnDat encoders, as they provide the necessary information for interpreting the encoder's signals and position data."

When PeriodLen is set to a value greater than 0, it indicates that the encoder is configured to operate as a linear encoder system, which is essential for proper functioning and monitoring of the encoder's performance. This distinction is crucial for accurately interpreting the encoder's signals and ensuring that the system operates correctly in applications involving linear motion."

In contrast, linear EnDat encoders are specifically designed to work with linear systems, and their parameters (such as MultiT and SingleT bits) are used to establish the relationship to the linear motor's magnetic pole pair subdivision. Thus, while linear EnDat encoders are recognized as linear systems, linear SSI encoders are not, and they are treated as rotary encoders instead."

In other words, while the Standard mode aligns the digital value with the analog tracks in a certain way, the SSI_180 mode uses a ""natural Q alignment"" that is rotated by 180 degrees relative to EnDat."

It is expressed in terms of n x 125 μs (microseconds), where the default setting corresponds to a CycleCount of 1, resulting in a sampling and evaluation cycle of 125 μs. Different settings for CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the encoder evaluation, but these should only be applied when necessary."

Specifically, these parameters allow the configuration of the encoder system to recognize and process the signals from the incremental encoders in conjunction with the distance-coded reference marks.

For example, if you are using a Sin/Cos incremental encoder like the Heidenhain ROD280C, which has a specific number of Sin/Cos tracks per revolution and distance-coded reference marks, you would set NominalIncrementA to the number of signal periods corresponding to the encoder's resolution (e.g., 1000 signal periods) and NominalIncrementB to a value that accounts for the reference marks (e.g., 1001 signal periods). This setup enables the system to accurately interpret the position and movement of the encoder based on the distance-coded reference marks, thereby enhancing the functionality of the encoder system. 

This functionality is activated when NominalIncrementA is greater than 0, allowing for precise positioning and improved performance in applications using Sin/Cos incremental encoders."

Specifically, if the ST bits are greater than the sum of LineBits and 8, the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization. Otherwise, the standard method, which uses a mix of the digital and analog components, will be applied."

This parameter helps in monitoring the operational status of the encoder and identifying any errors that may occur during its operation.

These parameters are used to determine how the commutation encoders relate to the linear motor's magnetic pole pair subdivision. Essentially, the number of tracks and the gearing define how the encoder's output correlates to the movement and positioning of the motor."

For Sin/Cos encoders with distance-coded reference marks, the system checks if the parameter PeriodLen is greater than 0. If it is, the system identifies the encoder as linear; otherwise, it treats it as rotary. Additionally, linear Sin/Cos encoders without an absolute value interface are also treated as rotary encoders. In cases where encoders are used as commutation encoders, the number of tracks or lines and the encoder gearing must be considered to establish the relationship to the linear motor's magnetic pole pair subdivision."

This means that if you are using an encoder like the Heidenhain ROD280C, which has a specific number of Sin/Cos tracks and distance-coded reference marks, you would need to configure NominalIncrementA to correspond to the appropriate number of signal periods. In this case, it allows for more precise position tracking and reference marking in the system, enhancing the encoder's performance and accuracy in applications where distance-coded reference marks are utilized."

If the CycleCount is increased, the sampling cycle will become longer, resulting in slower timing for the encoder evaluation. This means that the system will evaluate the encoder less frequently, which could potentially lead to reduced responsiveness or accuracy in position tracking, depending on the application. Different settings should be used cautiously and only when necessary, as they are considered special cases."

Specifically, when using the SSI_180(3) initialization method, the alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is offset by 180 degrees compared to the standard EnDat alignment. This means that the digital values will not align in the same way as they do with the standard method, but instead will be aligned in what is referred to as the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the Sin/Cos tracks. Other initialization methods, such as Standard (DIG_ANA(0)) and Digital (DIG(1)), do not have this offset and maintain the standard alignment."

In this case, the system cannot determine that the system is a linear encoder system based on the encoder head. Additionally, if the encoder is configured without distance-coded reference marks, it will also be treated as a rotary encoder."
