P 582[0] - ENC_CH3_PeriodLen = Sin/Cos linear encoder and P 583[0] - ENC_CH3_DigitalResolution = linear absolute encoder are the length of an analog Sin/Cos signal period in nanometres and the length of a digital increment of the position from the absolute value interface in nanometres. Both parameters are used for linear EnDat encoders (instead of MultiT and SingleT bits (rotary)). In contrast, linear SSI encoders are

Likewise, linear Sin/Cos encoders without an absolute value interface are treated as “rotary” encoders (if run as commutation encoders, the number of tracks, or lines (Lines) and the encoder gearing (Num, Denom) must be used to establish the relationship to the linear motor’s magn. pole pair subdivision). Only in the case of Sin/Cos encoders with distance-coded reference marks will the system determine, based on PeriodLen > 0, that the encoder system is linear and not rotary.

# Value Initialization:

- DIG_ANA(0) - Standard: Absolute value initialization using a mix of the digital and analog components (this is the default mode)
- DIG(1) - Digital: Only the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization.
- SEK_SEL37(2) - Automatic: Digital if ST bits > (LineBits + 8); otherwise standard
- SSI_180(3) - Same as Standard, except: In the case of SSI, the quadrant alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is not the same as with EnDat, but is instead offset by 180 degrees relative to EnDat, i.e. in the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the tracks.
