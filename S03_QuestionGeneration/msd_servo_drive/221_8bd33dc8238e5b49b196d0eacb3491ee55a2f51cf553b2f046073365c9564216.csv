# 11.6.38.7 Error 40-6 (emergency code 7300h)

Cause: Tech-Option initialisation error

Suggested steps:

- This issue is probably caused by an unsuitable parameter setting.
- Save your parameter set for a later restore.
",What are the suggested steps to address Error 40-6 (emergency code 7300h) in the MSD ServoDrive device?,"Save your parameter set for a later restore, check for implausible settings, and consider setting the device to factory settings before restarting.","To fix Error 40-6, first save your current parameter set. Then, inspect the parameter settings for any that seem implausible. Optionally, reset the device to factory settings and restart.","The MSD ServoDrive suggests saving your parameter set, verifying parameter settings for implausibility, and possibly performing a factory reset followed by a restart to resolve Error 40-6.","For Error 40-6, recommended actions include backing up your parameter set, examining parameters for unrealistic configurations, and resetting the device to its factory defaults before rebooting.","Addressing Error 40-6 involves three main steps: preserving your parameter set, assessing parameters for implausible values, and executing a factory reset followed by a device restart."
