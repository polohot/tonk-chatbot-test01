- See 'history of parameter changes' and undo the latest changes.
- Please check your parameter set for implausible settings.
- Please set device to factory setting, restart, and see if the error occurs again.
- When reporting this error to your service partner, please include your device's parameter setting.

# 11.6.34.11     Error 35-10 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: ENC CH1 ENDAT: error, diagnosis

# Suggested steps:

- endat encoder cyclic diagnosis monitoring error, check encoder
- The encoder is not connected or not working properly.
- If this encoder has analog signals, please check the signal amplitude vs. parameter EncObsMin
- Check cabling. If available, please try another encoder and cable.
- See detailed error information (>>) for a more detailed description.

# 11.6.34.12     Error 35-11 (emergency code 7307h)

Cause: ENC CH3 ENDAT: error, diagnosis

# Suggested steps:

- endat encoder cyclic diagnosis monitoring error, check encoder
- The encoder is not connected or not working properly.
- If this encoder has analog signals, please check the signal amplitude vs. parameter EncObsMin
- Check cabling. If available, please try another encoder and cable.
- See detailed error information (>>) for a more detailed description.

# 11.6.34.13     Error 35-12 (emergency code 7307h)

Cause: Channel 3 cyclic, HDSL: status error --> position invalid

# Suggested steps:

- Please check the encoder and wiring.
- Error during the cyclic evaluation of an encoder channel 3.
- In any case look at init outputs in the message window of the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5.
- The most common cause of error is the wiring to the encoder.

# 11.6.34.14     Error 35-11 (emergency code 7307h)

Cause: ENC CH3 ENDAT: error, diagnosis

# Suggested steps:

- If this encoder has analog signals, please check the signal amplitude vs. parameter EncObsMin
- Check cabling. If available, please try another encoder and cable.
- See detailed error information (>>) for a more detailed description.

# 11.6.35 Error 37: Syncronization controller error

# 11.6.35.1 Error 37-1 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Wrong ratio between interpolation-, synchonization- or velocity control time

# Suggested steps:

- Check the set cycle times in parameter 306, as well as according to the used bus system 2015 or 2266. Please pay attention to the different units!
