MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp 425

# 11.6.44 Error 47: Functional safety, common error

# 11.6.44.1 Error 47-0 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Unknown error in functional safety interface detected

Suggested steps:

- Acknowledge error, if the error occurs again, reset device
- An error occurred in the communication to the safety system.
- This is probably a software issue.
",What should be done if torque mode is used according to the MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp 425?,"Reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.","To address torque mode usage, options include torque reduction, enforcing external speed limits, or boosting speed control gain.","The text suggests three actions for torque mode: lowering torque, securing external speed limits, or enhancing speed control gain.","For torque mode, the guidance is to either decrease torque, apply external speed constraints, or raise speed control gain.","Adjustments recommended when using torque mode: torque reduction, external speed limitation, or increased speed control gain."
