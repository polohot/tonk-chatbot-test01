# 11.6.40.2 Error 43-1 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Plausibility error between IP address and subnetmask, subnetmask was corrected!

# Suggested steps:

- Check the settings of the IP address and the subnetmask of the Ethernet interface (X3/X9) in the parameters 671 and 688.
- This issue is probably caused by an unsuitable parameter setting.
