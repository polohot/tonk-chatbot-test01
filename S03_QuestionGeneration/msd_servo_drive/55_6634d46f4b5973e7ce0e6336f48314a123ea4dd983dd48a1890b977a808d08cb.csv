# 7.8.2 LHMES(2) method

known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

With this method, saturation effects in stator inductance are evaluated. Two test signal sequences are used for this purpose, whereby the position of the rotor axis is

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

- Inexperienced users should always choose the rated motor current (amplitude) as the current and a time of at least 2000 ms.
- If the axis is blocked, meaning the rotor is unable to align itself, the method will not work correctly. As a result, the commutation angle will be incorrectly defined and the motor may perform uncontrolled movements.
