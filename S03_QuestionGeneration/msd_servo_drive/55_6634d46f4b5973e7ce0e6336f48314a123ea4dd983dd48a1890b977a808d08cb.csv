This is crucial because if the rotor is not securely braked, it may be unable to align itself properly, leading to incorrect determination of the commutation angle. As a result, the motor could perform uncontrolled movements, which could potentially damage the system or lead to unsafe operating conditions. Securely braking the rotor allows for accurate measurement and control during the commutation process."

It ensures that the magnetic fields generated by the stator windings are aligned appropriately with the rotor's position, allowing for efficient torque production and smooth operation. If the commutation angle is incorrectly defined, it can lead to uncontrolled movements of the motor, as the rotor may not align properly with the magnetic fields, resulting in performance issues. Proper measurement and adjustment of the commutation angle are essential for the effective control of the motor, especially in applications involving precise positioning and high mass inertia."

This helps prevent potential damage to the motor and ensures accurate measurements. If an inexperienced user were to select a higher current, it could lead to uncontrolled movements of the motor, especially if the rotor is blocked or unable to align itself properly, resulting in incorrect commutation angles and potentially harmful situations. Therefore, sticking to the rated current helps maintain safety and reliability during operation."

- P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current (Test signal amplitude)
- P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current (Test signal direct component)

By setting these parameters to 0, default values derived from the motor/power stage current are assigned, and the measurement is then performed using these default settings."
