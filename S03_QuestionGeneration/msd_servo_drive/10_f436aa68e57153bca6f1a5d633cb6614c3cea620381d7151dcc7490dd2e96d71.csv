1. **Operational Principle**:
   - **Synchronous Motors**: These motors operate at a constant speed that is synchronized with the frequency of the supply current. The rotor rotates at the same speed as the magnetic field produced by the stator.
   - **Asynchronous Motors**: Also known as induction motors, these do not operate at synchronous speed. The rotor speed is always less than the speed of the magnetic field, which creates a relative motion that induces current in the rotor.

2. **Control Parameters**:
   - **Synchronous Motors**: Configuration involves setting parameters that ensure the rotor is locked in synchrony with the stator's magnetic field. This includes adjusting the excitation system and ensuring proper phase alignment.
   - **Asynchronous Motors**: Configuration focuses on parameters that manage slip (the difference between the synchronous speed and the rotor speed) and may involve adjusting the rotor resistance or using variable frequency drives to control speed.

3. **Starting Mechanisms**:
   - **Synchronous Motors**: These typically require a starting mechanism to bring them up to synchronous speed before they can operate effectively.
   - **Asynchronous Motors**: They can start directly from rest and accelerate to their operational speed without needing additional starting equipment.

4. **Feedback and Control**:
   - **Synchronous Motors**: Often require more complex feedback systems to maintain synchronization.
   - **Asynchronous Motors**: Generally simpler control systems, as they rely on slip for operation.

In summary, while both motor types serve similar functions, their configuration processes differ significantly due to their operational characteristics and control requirements."
