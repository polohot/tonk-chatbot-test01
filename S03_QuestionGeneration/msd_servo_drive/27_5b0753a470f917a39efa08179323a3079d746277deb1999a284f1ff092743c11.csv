1. **Position Accuracy**: Systematic errors can lead to incorrect position measurements, causing the system to operate outside of its intended parameters. This can result in misalignment or failure to reach desired positions.

2. **Speed Calculation**: Errors in the tracking signals can affect the calculated speed of the motor. If the speed is inaccurately measured, it can lead to poor control of the motor, resulting in sluggish or erratic performance.

3. **Control Stability**: The presence of gain and phase errors can destabilize the control loop, leading to oscillations or overshooting in response to commands. This instability can degrade the system's responsiveness and reliability.

4. **Efficiency**: Systematic errors can cause the motor to work harder to compensate for inaccuracies, leading to increased energy consumption and wear on components over time.

5. **Overall Performance**: The cumulative effect of these errors can lead to reduced performance of the entire system, impacting productivity and potentially leading to increased downtime for maintenance or recalibration.

Utilizing methods like Gain Phase Offset Correction (GPOC) can help mitigate these systematic errors, improving the accuracy and reliability of the tracking signals and, consequently, the overall system performance."
