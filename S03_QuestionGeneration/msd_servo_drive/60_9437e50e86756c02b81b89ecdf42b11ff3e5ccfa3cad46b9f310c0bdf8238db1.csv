1. **With Pressure Limitation (CTRL2 = 1)**: In this mode, the volumetric flow rate is controlled while ensuring that the pressure does not exceed a predefined limit. This means that the system will adjust the flow rate to maintain the pressure within safe operating parameters, preventing potential damage or inefficiencies.

2. **Without Pressure Limitation (CTRL1 = 0101)**: In this mode, the volumetric flow rate is controlled without any restrictions on pressure. The system can allow the pressure to rise beyond the predefined limits, which may lead to higher flow rates but also increases the risk of exceeding safe pressure levels.

In summary, the key difference lies in the presence of pressure control: one mode restricts flow to maintain pressure limits, while the other allows for unrestricted flow, potentially leading to higher pressures."

2. **Deceleration (HYD_PumpDec)**: Conversely, this parameter specifies the rate at which the hydraulic pump speed can decrease, also measured in rpm/s. A higher deceleration value means the pump can slow down more rapidly, which is important for controlling the system's response and preventing overshoot or sudden stops that could lead to mechanical stress or instability.

In summary, acceleration refers to how quickly the pump can speed up, while deceleration refers to how quickly it can slow down. Both parameters are essential for controlling the performance and responsiveness of hydraulic systems."
