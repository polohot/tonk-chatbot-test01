This means that the servo drive can accurately determine how far the cylinder has moved based on the number of encoder revolutions. This relationship is essential for calculating cylinder speed and feed-forward control variables, ensuring precise control over the hydraulic motion of the cylinder.

Additionally, when the current position of the cylinder is communicated via the bus interface, the single and multiturn range is set to 16 bits each, corresponding to 65,536 μm/rev. This further emphasizes the importance of encoder resolution in achieving accurate and responsive control of the cylinder's position and speed within the servo drive system."

Specifically, the MSD Servo Drive requires a relationship between linear motion (the movement of the hydraulic cylinder) and rotary motion (the rotation of the encoder).

This relationship is defined by the encoder resolution, which is specified in micrometers per encoder revolution (μm/rev). For example, if a linear encoder has a resolution of 0.5 μm per increment and operates at a 16-bit resolution, one encoder revolution corresponds to 32,768 μm. This means that for every complete rotation of the encoder, the system can measure a linear displacement of 32,768 μm.

Additionally, when the current position of the cylinder is communicated via the bus interface, the single and multiturn range is set to 16 bits each, resulting in a measurement of 65,536 μm/rev. This relationship is crucial for the internal calculations of the cylinder model, cylinder speed, and feed-forward control variables, ensuring that the hydraulic system operates effectively and accurately in response to control commands."

In the context of the MSD Servo Drive, the singleturn range is defined as the number of micrometers (μm) that correspond to one complete revolution of the encoder. For example, a singleturn range of 32768 μm/rev for a 16-bit linear encoder with a resolution of 0.5 μm per increment means that the position sensor can provide very precise measurements of the cylinder's position within a single revolution.

This relationship between linear and rotary motion is crucial for the internal calculations of the cylinder model, cylinder speed, and feed-forward control variables. A higher resolution (more μm per revolution) allows for finer control and more accurate positioning of the cylinder, which is essential for applications requiring precise motion control. Conversely, a lower resolution may lead to less accurate position measurements, potentially affecting the performance and responsiveness of the hydraulic system. 

In summary, the singleturn range directly impacts the fidelity of position measurements, which in turn influences the overall control and performance of the cylinder within the hydraulic system."

1. **High Precision**: The resolution of 0.5 μm per increment allows for very fine control of the cylinder position. This high precision is crucial for applications requiring accurate positioning and movement, as it enables the system to make small adjustments in response to control signals.

2. **Encoder Revolution Calculation**: With a 16-bit encoder, there are 2^16 (or 65,536) increments per revolution. Therefore, one complete revolution of the encoder corresponds to 32768 μm (65,536 increments × 0.5 μm/increment). This relationship is essential for converting rotary motion into linear motion, which is necessary for the internal calculations of the cylinder model, cylinder speed, and feed-forward control variables.

3. **Improved Feedback Control**: The high resolution of the encoder enhances the feedback control capabilities of the servo drive. It allows the system to monitor the position of the cylinder with greater accuracy, leading to better performance in terms of speed and position control.

4. **Complexity in Calculations**: The need to translate between linear and rotary motion introduces complexity in the control algorithms. The system must account for the encoder resolution when calculating the cylinder's speed and position, which may require more sophisticated processing.

5. **Potential for Increased Noise Sensitivity**: While high-resolution encoders provide better precision, they can also be more sensitive to noise and disturbances. This means that the system may require additional filtering or error correction mechanisms to ensure that the position readings remain accurate.

6. **Compatibility with System Parameters**: The encoder's resolution must be compatible with the parameters set in the servo drive, such as the hydraulic physical unit scaling (P 2852.7 - unit_scale). Ensuring that these parameters align is crucial for the correct functioning of the system.

In summary, a 16-bit linear encoder with a resolution of 0.5 μm per increment enhances the precision and control of the hydraulic system but also introduces complexity in calculations and potential sensitivity to noise."

When a command for a valve switchover is triggered, a timer begins, which delays the enabling of the setpoint. This means that the servo drive will not immediately respond to the new setpoint until the delay period has elapsed.

Additionally, if the motor has a speed reference value at the moment of the switchover, it will be gradually reduced to 0 rpm using a specified ramp (defined by parameter P 2851.12 - stopRamp) before the new setpoint is applied. This controlled ramp-down helps to ensure smooth transitions and prevents abrupt changes in motion, which could lead to instability or mechanical stress in the system.

Overall, the valve switching delay is crucial for managing the timing of hydraulic actions, ensuring that the system operates smoothly and effectively during transitions between different operational states."

This delay is accounted for by the parameter P 2851.13 - tSwValve, which specifies the valve switching delay. During this delay, if the motor still has a speed reference value at the moment of the switchover, it will be gradually reduced to 0 rpm using the ramp specified in P 2851.12 - stopRamp.

This scaling is essential for the internal calculations of the cylinder model, cylinder speed, and feed-forward control variables within the servo drive system.

Specifically, the unit scaling determines how the position and movement of the hydraulic cylinder are translated into encoder revolutions. For instance, if the unit scaling is set to 32768 μm/rev for a 16-bit linear encoder with a resolution of 0.5 μm per increment, it means that one complete revolution of the encoder corresponds to 32768 micrometers of linear movement. This relationship is critical for accurately controlling the position and speed of the hydraulic actuator.

If the unit scaling is not correctly configured, it can lead to inaccuracies in the hydraulic motion profile, affecting the responsiveness and precision of the servo drive. For example, if the scaling is set incorrectly, the servo drive may misinterpret the actual position of the cylinder, leading to improper control commands and potentially causing erratic or inefficient operation of the hydraulic system.

In summary, hydraulic physical unit scaling is vital for ensuring accurate translation between linear and rotary motion, which directly impacts the performance and reliability of the servo drive in controlling hydraulic actuators."

1. **Cylinder Dimensions**: The surface areas of the piston (cylArea1) and ring (cylArea2) must be specified, as they influence the amount of medium required for movement depending on the power direction.

2. **Direction of Operation**: For pumps that operate in only one direction, one of the cylinder surfaces must be specified as negative. If the pump can operate in both directions, this specification is not necessary.

3. **Encoder Resolution**: The relationship between linear and rotary motion must be established, which requires knowledge of the encoder resolution (unit_scale). For example, a 16-bit linear encoder with a resolution of 0.5 μm per increment has a specific encoder resolution that affects internal calculations.

4. **Current Position Transfer**: If the current position of the cylinder is communicated via a bus interface, the single and multiturn range must be set correctly to ensure accurate position tracking.

For communication with higher-level controllers in CTRL1 and CTRL2 modes, scaling factors of process variables and control parameters are summarized in P 2879 HYD_AddProcData, which are PDO-capable and created in int16 format to minimize memory usage in the process data channel."

This occurs independently of the NewSetpoint and ramp change, specifically triggered by a rising edge at NewSetpoint or when a new table index is selected."

PDOs are used for real-time data exchange between devices in a network, allowing for efficient and timely communication of process variables and control parameters. Being PDO-capable means that the parameters can be included in these data objects, enabling them to be sent and received quickly with minimal overhead, which is particularly important in applications requiring fast response times, such as in control systems for servo drives."

This mode allows for automatic valve switching based on the difference in position between the current state and the desired state. When the position difference exceeds a certain threshold or condition, the system can trigger the actuating valves to switch, thereby adjusting the hydraulic operation accordingly. This automatic control helps ensure that the hydraulic system responds effectively to changes in position, maintaining desired performance and operational efficiency."
