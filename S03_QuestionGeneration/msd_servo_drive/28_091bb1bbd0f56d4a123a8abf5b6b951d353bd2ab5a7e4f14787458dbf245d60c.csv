# NOTE

- In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).
- Encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing.

# Table 6.16: Configuring and activating GPOC

See Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89. The encoder gearing for encoder channels Ch1, Ch2 and Ch3 is described there.

# NOTE

- In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).
- Encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing.
