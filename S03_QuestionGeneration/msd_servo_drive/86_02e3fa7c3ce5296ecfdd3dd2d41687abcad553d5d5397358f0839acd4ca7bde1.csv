# 11.6.3.2 Error 2-2 (emergency code 6320h)

Cause: Parameter virgin initalisation failed

Suggested steps:

- Switch off/on device. Please contact your service provider if this error occurs again

This issue is probably

- Save your parameter set for a later restore.
- See 'history of parameter changes' and undo the latest changes.
- Please check your parameter set for implausible settings.
- Please set device to factory setting, restart, and see if the error occurs again.
- When reporting this error to your service partner, please include your device's parameter setting.

This is probably a software issue.

- Please try to switch to a different version of device firmware.
- Save your dataset and reset the axis module to factory setting. See if the error persists, or if it comes with activating a certain feature.
