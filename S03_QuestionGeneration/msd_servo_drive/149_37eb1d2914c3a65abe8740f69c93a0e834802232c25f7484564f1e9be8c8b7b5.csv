# 11.6.19.10 Error 18-10 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Homing: Homing travel exceeded

Suggested steps:

- The zero pulse has not been reached within the permissible distance. Please check the zero pulse of the encoder and the parameter 169[0] for the maximum distance.
- Please check whether the encoder is working correctly.

# 11.6.19.11 Error 18-11 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Max. permissible tracking error on ""Start control"" exceeded

Suggested steps:

- Reset error and start again
- An error occurred at the homing method. Please acknowledge the error.
