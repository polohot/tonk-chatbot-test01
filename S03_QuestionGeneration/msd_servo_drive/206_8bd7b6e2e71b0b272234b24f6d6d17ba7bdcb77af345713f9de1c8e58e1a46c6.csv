# 11.6.32.2 Error 33-1 (emergency code 5300h)

Cause: Control task exceeded scan time

Suggested steps:

- Please restart device.
- Computational load in time-critical task of axis module is too high.
- Please reduce computational load by removing parameters from mapping.
- De-activate features of control system or motion control.
- This is probably a software issue.
- Please try to switch to a different version of device firmware.
- Save your dataset and reset the axis module to factory setting. See if the error persists, or if it comes with activating a certain feature.
