# 7.8 Synchronous motor auto commutation

For field-oriented regulation of permanently excited synchronous motors with a purely incremental measuring system, the commutation position must be determined once when the control is started (adjustment of current rotor position to encoder zero [encoder offset]). This procedure is executed by the ""Auto commutation"" function after initial enabling of the control when the mains voltage has been switched on for the first time. It can also be forced during commissioning by changing a parameter, which causes a complete controller initialization (e.g. change of auto commutation parameters, change of control mode etc.). Owing to the differing requirements arising from the applications, various commutation methods are provided (P 390[0] - CON_ICOM).

To check in commissioning whether the auto commutation has been successful, P 394 - CON_ICOM_Check is provided. It comprises the current commutation angle error P 394[1] - ActVal and a parameterizable limit value P 394[0] - Limit. If the commutation angle error exceeds the specified limit value, an error is generated.

If substantial variations between the q-current reference and actual values occur during run-up to reference speed in the field-weakening range, the Servo Drive may be at the voltage limit. In this case, a check should first be made as to whether the preset maximum value P 340[0] - CON_FM_Imag has already been reached and can be increased. If the maximum value has not yet been reached, the voltage controller is not dynamic enough and the gain P 345[0] - CON_FM_VConKp must be increased.

If no suitable compromise can be found, the voltage threshold as from which the voltage control intervenes must be reduced by the scaling parameter P 347[0] - CON_FM_VRef. If the response with voltage controller is unproblematic and no particular demands are made in terms of dynamism, the available torque can be optimized by setting P 347[0] - CON_FM_VRef to values up to 98%.

# 7.8 Synchronous motor auto commutation

For field-oriented regulation of permanently excited synchronous motors with a purely incremental measuring system, the commutation position must be determined once when the control is started (adjustment of current rotor position to encoder zero [encoder offset]). This procedure is executed by the ""Auto commutation"" function after initial enabling of the control when the mains voltage has been switched on for the first time. It can also be forced during commissioning by changing a parameter, which causes a complete controller initialization (e.g. change of auto commutation parameters, change of control mode etc.). Owing to the differing requirements arising from the applications, various commutation methods are provided (P 390[0] - CON_ICOM).

To check in commissioning whether the auto commutation has been successful, P 394 - CON_ICOM_Check is provided. It comprises the current commutation angle error P 394[1] - ActVal and a parameterizable limit value P 394[0] - Limit. If the commutation angle error exceeds the specified limit value, an error is generated.
