1. **Check Maximum Value**: First, verify whether the preset maximum value P 340[0] - CON_FM_Imag has already been reached. If it has, consider increasing this maximum value.

2. **Increase Gain**: If the maximum value has not been reached, it indicates that the voltage controller is not dynamic enough. In this case, you should increase the gain P 345[0] - CON_FM_VConKp.

3. **Adjust Voltage Threshold**: If a suitable compromise cannot be found after adjusting the gain, you may need to reduce the voltage threshold from which the voltage control intervenes by adjusting the scaling parameter P 347[0] - CON_FM_VRef.

4. **Optimize Torque**: If the response with the voltage controller is satisfactory and there are no particular demands for dynamism, you can optimize the available torque by setting P 347[0] - CON_FM_VRef to values up to 98%. 

By following these steps, you can effectively adjust the gain of the voltage controller to address the variations between the q-current reference and actual values."

This involves adjusting the current rotor position to the encoder zero (encoder offset). The function is executed after the initial enabling of the control when the mains voltage is switched on for the first time. It ensures that the rotor is correctly aligned for optimal performance by allowing the system to automatically set the necessary parameters for commutation based on the specific application requirements. Additionally, it can be forced during commissioning by changing a parameter that triggers a complete controller initialization."
