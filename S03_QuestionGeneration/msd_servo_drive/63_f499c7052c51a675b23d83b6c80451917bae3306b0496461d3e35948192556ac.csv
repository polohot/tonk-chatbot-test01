# 7.11.8.2 Volumetric flow rate control without pressure limitation

If there is no need for a pressure limitation, a volumetric flow rate control without pressure limitation (VolCon(5) = volumetric flow rate control (without pressure limitation)) can be selected in P 2860 - HYD_TabConMode. This provides the same functions but is not linked to the pressure control. ",How is steady-state accuracy achieved in volumetric flow rate control?,"By utilizing leakage compensation, the system achieves steady-state accuracy in flow rate control.",Steady-state accuracy is attained through the application of leakage compensation techniques.,The system ensures precise flow rate control at steady states by compensating for leakage.,Achieving steady-state accuracy involves adjusting for leakage within the flow rate control.,"Through leakage compensation, the volumetric flow rate control maintains accuracy in steady-state conditions."

An additional pressure limiting control system is set up for this purpose. If the configured pressure limits are reached, the motor speed will be dynamically limited upwards or downwards accordingly.

NOTE

- To do so, the pressure regulator must also be parametrized and set.

In addition to the pressure limitation, the minimum and maximum volumetric flow rate can be set via a volumetric flow rate limitation (see Section ""Hydraulic Limitations"" on page 184).
