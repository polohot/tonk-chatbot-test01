# 6.8.2.2 Start-up of a sensorless-controlled asynchronous motor

If the stability and the torque in the proximity of standstill are inadequate, use the current/frequency mode (I/f). Set P 792[0] Switch = 2. Set the speed limits P 792[7] and P 792[8] lower than for the use of flux boost. The d current P 792 [9] must be adequate to set the maximum possible load in motion when starting.

Whether a setting of ""2"" or ""3"" is the better choice depends on the application. An asynchronous motor is not suitable for sensorless positioning due to its design because the rotor does not have a fixed magnetic pole. ",What are the key parameters for configuring the start-up of a sensorless-controlled asynchronous motor in I/f mode?,"Key parameters include P 792[0] for mode selection, P 792[7] and P 792[8] for speed limits, and P 792[9] for d current offset.","To configure start-up in I/f mode, adjust P 792[0] to 2, set P 792[7] and P 792[8] for speed, and configure P 792[9] for current.","Essential settings involve P 792[0] (mode), P 792[7] and P 792[8] (speed ranges), and P 792[9] (d current offset).","For I/f mode start-up, P 792[0], P 792[7], P 792[8], and P 792[9] must be appropriately configured.","Configuring start-up in I/f mode requires setting P 792[0], adjusting P 792[7] and P 792[8], and fine-tuning P 792[9]."
