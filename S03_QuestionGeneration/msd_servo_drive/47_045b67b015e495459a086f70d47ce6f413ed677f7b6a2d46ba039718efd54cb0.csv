This filtering is particularly beneficial when operating drives at high speeds, as it helps to reduce noise and fluctuations in the current readings.

In the low-speed range, the control system can effectively eliminate disturbance torques. In the medium to high-speed range, the table-based compensation significantly reduces these disturbance torques. However, in the high-speed range, the finite resolution of the feed-forward control means that the detent torque compensation is gradually eliminated using a fade function (ramp).

When detent torque compensation is employed, the q-current input data is imported into a teach table within the controller. This table is then used to calculate a compensation table that facilitates feed-forward control of the q-current.
