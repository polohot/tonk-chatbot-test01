Lowering the current demand and switching frequency, ensuring the encoder offset is correct, and upgrading to a higher-rated axis module are also recommended.","For Error 9-1, steps include load reduction, current control check, saturation adjustment (MOT_LSigDiff), current reduction, frequency adjustment, encoder offset verification, and considering a higher current axis module.","Suggested actions for I2t motor error: 1) Decrease motor load, 2) Inspect current settings, 3) Adjust saturation parameters, 4) Lower current and frequency, 5) Verify encoder settings, 6) Upgrade axis module if necessary.","Addressing Error 9 involves multiple steps: reducing motor load, checking and adjusting current and saturation settings, possibly lowering operational current and frequency, ensuring encoder accuracy, and evaluating the need for a more capable axis module."
