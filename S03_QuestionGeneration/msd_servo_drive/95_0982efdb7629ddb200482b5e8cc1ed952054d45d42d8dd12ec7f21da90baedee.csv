# 11 Alarms & warnings

# 11.6.7.5 Error 6-5 (emergency code 4310h)

Cause: Motor protection method not supported

# Suggested steps:

- Try to use different sensor connection, or contact your service provider.
- This issue is probably caused by an unsuitable parameter setting.
",What is the cause of Error 6-4 (emergency code 4310h) in the MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp 339?,"PTC/TSS error, resistance still higher than 1650 Ohm after overtemperature.",The error is due to PTC/TSS resistance remaining above 1650 Ohm post overtemperature.,Occurs when PTC/TSS resistance exceeds 1650 Ohm following overtemperature.,"PTC/TSS resistance stays over 1650 Ohm after overheating, causing the error.",Cause: PTC/TSS resistance >1650 Ohm after overtemperature.
