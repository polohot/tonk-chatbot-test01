Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

- Please note that the pinouts for evaluating the zero pulse for the MSD Servo Drive and MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact are different from each other.
- If your Servo Drive comes with a technology option with an encoder function (X8 connector), see the corresponding Specification for a description of the encoder connections (see Section ""Applicable documentation"" on page 12).

NOTE

The current used to determine the encoder offset (commutation offset) is specified by P 457[0] - MOT_CNom. This value should be reduced if the acceleration has too much jerk.

CAUTION! Damage to the device as a result of incorrect motor winding insulation! Improper conduct can lead to damage to the motor/device.

The motor temperature sensor must have basic insulation to the motor winding when connected to X5 and reinforced insulation to IEC/EN 61800-5-1 when connected to X6 or X7.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# Signal correction (GPOC)

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If “SINCOS(1)” is selected as the “main interface,” this process may be useful. ",What happens after connecting pin 7 to pin 12 in the X7 connector of the MSD ServoDrive?,"A voltage of 11.8 V will appear at X7, pin 3 after connecting pin 7 to pin 12.",Connecting these pins results in an 11.8 V output at X7's pin 3.,The connection triggers an 11.8 V voltage at pin 3 of X7.,An 11.8 V output is generated at X7's pin 3 upon connecting pin 7 to pin 12.,This connection causes X7's pin 3 to display 11.8 V.
