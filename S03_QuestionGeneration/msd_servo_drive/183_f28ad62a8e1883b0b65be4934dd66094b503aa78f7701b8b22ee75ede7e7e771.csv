ENP

- The ""Electronic Nameplate"" (ENP) is located in the OEM memory of the motor encoder and contains primarily motor related data.
- In the simplest case, the ENP contains only the commutation angle (ECOFF) between motor phases and encoder mounting.

# 11.6.22.9 Error 21-12 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: Electronic nameplate, process block error: group error from short frame check of the block being read.

Suggested steps:

- Function ""Electronic nameplate"" not available. ",What is the 'Electronic Nameplate' (ENP) and where is it located?,The 'Electronic Nameplate' (ENP) is located in the OEM memory of the motor encoder and contains primarily motor related data.,"ENP, found in the motor encoder's OEM memory, mainly holds data related to the motor.","Located within the OEM memory of the motor encoder, the ENP stores motor-related information.","The ENP is situated in the motor encoder's OEM memory, primarily containing data about the motor.","In the motor encoder's OEM memory lies the ENP, which is chiefly concerned with motor data."
