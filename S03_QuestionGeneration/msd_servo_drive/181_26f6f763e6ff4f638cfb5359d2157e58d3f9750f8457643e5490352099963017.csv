- ENP: The ""Electronic Nameplate"" (ENP) is located in the OEM memory of the motor encoder and contains primarily motor related data.
- In the simplest case, the ENP contains only the commutation angle (ECOFF) between motor phases and encoder mounting.

# 11.6.22.2 Error 21-3 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: Electronic nameplate, parameterization: ENP operation is switched off.

# Suggested steps:

- Function ""Electronic nameplate"" not available. Please contact your service provider.
- ENP: The ""Electronic Nameplate"" (ENP) is located in the OEM memory of the motor encoder and contains primarily motor related data.
- In the simplest case, the ENP contains only the commutation angle (ECOFF) between motor phases and encoder mounting.

# 11.6.22 Error 21: Initialization, common error

Group error initialization

# Suggested steps:

- This is a common error number used for several initialization errors, which have no own error number.

# 11.6.22.3 Error 21-4 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: Electronic nameplate, parameterization: ENP operation is not supported by firmware.

Suggested steps:

Function ""Electronic nameplate"" not available. Please contact your service provider.

- The ""Electronic Nameplate"" (ENP) is located in the OEM memory of the motor encoder and contains primarily motor related data.
- In the simplest case, the ENP contains only the commutation angle (ECOFF) between motor phases and encoder mounting.

# 11.6.22.4 Error 21-5 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: Electronic nameplate, OEM data: no OEM memory defined in the encoder.

Suggested steps:

Function ""Electronic nameplate"" not available. Please contact your service provider.

# 11.6.22.6 Error 21-7 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: Electronic nameplate, parameterization: no order for ENP operation.

Suggested steps:

Define an order for ENP operation. ",What is the cause and suggested step for Error 21-7 (emergency code 7305h)?,Error 21-7 is caused by no order for ENP operation being defined. The suggested step is to define an order for ENP operation.,The absence of a defined order for ENP operation causes Error 21-7. Defining such an order is recommended.,"When there's no order defined for ENP operation, Error 21-7 occurs. The solution is to define an order.",Error 21-7 arises from the lack of a defined order for ENP operation. Defining one is the suggested action.,"The cause of Error 21-7 is no order for ENP operation being defined, and the solution is to define an order."
