As of the starting speed, the effect of the isq feed forward control is faded out linearly with the increase of the ‘slow’ speed. A ramp is used which ensures that at the ending speed, the isq feed forward control no longer has any effect (=0). ",What is the purpose of the 'Detent torque compensation' parameters listed in the MSD ServoDrive device?,These parameters configure the anti-cogging compensation table and control its behavior.,They are used to set up and manage the anti-cogging compensation table's properties and operations.,"The parameters define the anti-cogging compensation table's structure, values, and operational controls.","Purpose includes defining the compensation table's index, values, start position, delta, and other operational specifics.",They enable the configuration and fine-tuning of the anti-cogging compensation table for optimal performance.

The compensation (feed forward control) can now be activated using: P 382[0] - CON_TCoggComp > 0.

Caution: Of course, not every compensation parametrization fits with every previous teaching parametrization.

The input and output variables can be observed via scope signals during the teaching routine and the compensation. The signal 156_eps_comp. shows the current raw input position (source) both during the teaching routine and later during the compensation. The signal 157_eps_comp.tune gives the current input position including the input tuning (only for the functions 1). The table index and the table output can both be accessed via the scope signals 440_CON_TAB_TabIdx and 446_CON_TAB_OutVal.

The parameter P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon selects the position source for the teaching and sets the teach modes (including: rotary or absolute): the teaching is activated and the compensation is deactivated. With ‘start control’ in the speed control mode, the teaching (teaching routine) begins with a slow run: e.g. <= 1 rpm (at least one revolution of ‘learning’ travel).

With the control still operating (and a slow run), the teaching is then stopped by calling the calculation function once: with P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon=CALC1(3) or with P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeach- Con = CALC2(8). It ‘calculates’ the corresponding compensation table (which can be saved) from.
