Cause: Positive software limit switch is exceeded (positive position limit)

Suggested steps:

- Quit error and change reference value
- Position was limited internally. Please check factor group setting and position command
- Take a scope record to determine if the position control overshoots.
- The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.
- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.
