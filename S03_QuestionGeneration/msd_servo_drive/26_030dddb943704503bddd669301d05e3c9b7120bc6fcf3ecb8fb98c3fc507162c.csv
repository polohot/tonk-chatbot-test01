# 6.6.1 Compensation for long resolver cables

When using long resolver cables, there will be a phase shift between the controller’s exciter output signal and the controller’s track input signals (S1-S3 and S2-S4). This phase difference can be compensated for with P 565[0] - ResExc: ResExc is the time, in μs (microseconds), by which the resolver excitation will lead. Moreover, P 565[1] - Delay can be used to compensate for a commutation dead time, which

can become important in the case of higher rotating field frequencies. When there is an absolute reduction in signal strengths (amplitudes) as a result of the long cables, P 566[0] - ENC_CH2_Amplitude can be used to subsequently increase these amplitudes (up to a max. of +10.5%) so that a drive signal level of 80–85% for the track signals is once again attained. This is achieved by adjusting the resolver excitation amplitude. Parameter P 567[0] - ENC_CH2_EncObsAct can be used to check the effects of adjusting the compensation settings. It returns the length of the phasor for the track signals (sqrt(a²+b²)) and is accordingly a measure of “the amplitude” of the track signals: If the phase shift is properly corrected at the end of the compensation adjustment process, you can save the settings.
