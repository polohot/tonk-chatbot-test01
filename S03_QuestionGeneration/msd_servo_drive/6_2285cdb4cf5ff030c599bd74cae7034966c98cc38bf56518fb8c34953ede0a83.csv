If there is a high load, the system reduces the operating switching frequency from the set parameter P 302 - CON_SwitchFreq stepwise. Conversely, when the load decreases, the switching frequency is increased again in the same stepwise manner. The system can switch to the next lower or higher possible switching frequency, with the maximum reduction being 2 “steps”. This means there are three levels for the switching frequency that the system can operate within based on the load conditions."

Specifically, as the switching frequency is raised, the audible noise generated by the system diminishes, particularly when the frequency exceeds 12 kHz, which falls within the audible range. Therefore, operating at a higher switching frequency can help reduce the noise levels associated with the servo drive."

When the parameter P 752[0] - MON_PWM_SwitchFreqSelect_Sel is set to “AUTO(1)"", the operating switching frequency from parameter P 302 - CON_SwitchFreq is adjusted stepwise in response to the load. If there is a high load, the system reduces the switching frequency, and when the load decreases, it raises the frequency again. The system can switch to the next lower or higher possible switching frequency, depending on the device and the currently selected operating switching frequency. The switching frequency can be reduced by a maximum of 2 “steps”."

msd_servo_drive.txt,6,2285cdb4cf5ff030c599bd74cae7034966c98cc38bf56518fb8c34953ede0a83,How does the switching frequency impact the performance of multi-axis systems?,"The switching frequency impacts the performance of multi-axis systems in several ways:

1. **Control Dynamism**: Increasing the switching frequency can enhance the control dynamism of the servo drive, allowing for more responsive and precise control of the system.

2. **Power Reduction**: While a higher switching frequency can improve performance, it may also lead to temperature-related power loss, especially in higher-powered devices. This means that excessively high switching frequencies may reduce the overall power output of the system.

3. **Noise Levels**: Higher switching frequencies can reduce audible noise levels, as the noise generated by switching frequencies decreases when the frequency exceeds 12 kHz.

4. **Automatic Adjustment**: In systems with online derating, the switching frequency can be automatically adjusted based on current load conditions. If the load is high, the system may lower the switching frequency to maintain performance without overheating, and it can increase the frequency again when the load decreases.

5. **Operational Range**: The operational switching frequency range is defined by the parameter settings, and the system can switch between different frequencies based on load conditions, which can optimize performance under varying operational scenarios.

Overall, the choice of switching frequency is crucial for balancing performance, efficiency, and thermal management in multi-axis systems."

This means that the servo drive will automatically switch to a lower switching frequency to accommodate the increased load conditions. Once the load decreases, the switching frequency can be raised back to its previous level. The system can reduce the switching frequency by a maximum of 2 steps."
msd_servo_drive.txt,6,2285cdb4cf5ff030c599bd74cae7034966c98cc38bf56518fb8c34953ede0a83,What should be considered when selecting the switching frequency for a servo drive?,"When selecting the switching frequency for a servo drive, the following considerations should be taken into account:

1. **Factory Setting**: It is advisable to start with the factory setting of 8 kHz, as this is typically optimized for general use.

2. **Control Dynamism**: Increasing the switching frequency can enhance control dynamism, allowing for better performance in certain applications.

3. **Power Reduction Risks**: A higher switching frequency, especially when combined with high power settings, may lead to temperature-related power loss. This should be carefully evaluated to avoid performance issues.

4. **Noise Levels**: Higher switching frequencies can reduce audible noise, as switching frequency noises decrease with increasing frequency, particularly when above 12 kHz.

5. **Online Derating**: If the system is set to automatic switching (P 752[0] - MON_PWM_SwitchFreqSelect_Sel = “AUTO(1)”), the switching frequency will adjust based on current load conditions. Under high load, the frequency may be reduced, and it can be increased again when the load decreases. The system can switch between three levels of frequency, depending on the device and the selected operating frequency.

6. **Device Limitations**: The specific switching frequencies available for adjustment depend on the device being used. It is important to refer to the device's documentation for the applicable switching frequency ranges.

7. **Maximum Reduction Steps**: The switching frequency can be reduced by a maximum of 2 steps, which should be taken into account when configuring the system.

By considering these factors, one can optimize the performance and reliability of the servo drive in its intended application."
