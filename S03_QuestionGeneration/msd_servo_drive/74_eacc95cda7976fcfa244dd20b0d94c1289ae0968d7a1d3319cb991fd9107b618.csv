- The start movement is in the direction of the negative, left hardware limit switch. The homing point is set at the first zero pulse after a falling edge from the reference mark.
- The first zero pulse after passing the reference mark is the zero point.

# 8.5.10.2 Method (8):

- The zero point is the first zero pulse if the reference mark is active.
- The direction of movement reverses after a falling edge from the reference mark. The zero point corresponds to the first zero pulse after a rising edge from the reference mark.
- The direction of movement reverses when the reference mark has been passed. The zero point corresponds to the first zero pulse after a rising edge.

# 8.5.10.3 Method (9):

- The direction of movement changes when the reference mark becomes inactive. The zero point corresponds to the first zero pulse after a rising edge.
- The zero point is the first zero pulse if the reference mark is active.

# 8.5.10.4 Method (10):

- Once the reference mark has been passed, the first zero pulse after the falling edge is the zero point.

# 8.5.11 Method (11) to (14): Reference mark, zero pulse and negative limit switch

- After a falling edge from the reference mark: The first zero pulse corresponds to the zero point.
- After an active reference mark: The zero point corresponds to the first zero pulse after the falling edge.

# 8.5.11.1 Method (11)

- Reversal of direction of movement after active reference mark. The zero point corresponds to the first zero pulse after the falling edge.
- Zero point at the first zero pulse after falling edge from the reference mark.
- Movement must have gone beyond the reference mark, then the first zero pulse corresponds to the zero point.
