# Motor phase test

A motor phase check has been implemented which permits monitoring of the motor wiring. It also checks whether the parameter setting of the pulses per revolution of the encoder and the number of pole pairs of the resolver match the number of pole pairs of the motor. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed. Disable motor brake during the motor phase test.

# Determining the encoder offset

Once the safety notice window has been confirmed, the wizard is activated to determine the encoder offset. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed.

# Motor phase test

A motor phase check has been implemented which permits monitoring of the motor wiring. It also checks whether the parameter setting of the pulses per revolution of the encoder and the number of pole pairs of the resolver match the number of pole pairs of the motor. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed. Disable motor brake during the motor phase test.

# Determining the encoder offset

Once the safety notice window has been confirmed, the wizard is activated to determine the encoder offset. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed.

To be able to run the automatic tests, you will need to read and confirm the safety prompts. Once you are done doing so, you will be able to run the individual tests.

Image 3.4: “Initial Commissioning - Automatic tests” screen

# Motor phase test

A motor phase check has been implemented which permits monitoring of the motor wiring. It also checks whether the parameter setting of the pulses per revolution of the encoder and the number of pole pairs of the resolver match the number of pole pairs of the motor. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed. Disable motor brake during the motor phase test.

# Determining the encoder offset

Once the safety notice window has been confirmed, the wizard is activated to determine the encoder offset. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed.

 Brief description           l  The initial commissioning for the drive can be
                                carried out with the help of a wizard. The wizard
                                will take you through the process step-by-step,
                                ensuring that the available configuration options
                                are presented in a clear and manageable manner.
                             l  This chapter describes how the initial
                                commissioning wizard works. This wizard is used
                                to set up the initial configuration for the MSD Servo

3.1     Initial Commissioning wizard
The wizard guides you through the subject areas that are relevant for the initial
commissioning. Correct setting of the parameters permits controlled movement of
the drive via the manual mode window (for details see Section ""Manual mode"" on
page 449). Further settings must be made to exactly adapt the drive system to an
application.
3.1.1 Hardware requirements

    l  Correct assembly and installation, in line with the intended use, as per the
       instructions in the applicable operation manual (see Section ""Applicable
       documentation"" on page 12).
    l  Voltage supplies
           o  24 V control voltage
           o  Mains voltage

    l  Hardware enable

           o  Enable Power (ENPO)

3.1.2 Prompt Initial commissioning
If the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 is opened without an existing project, a prompt to
undertake initial commissioning appears automatically.

# 3.2 Automatic test

To be able to run the automatic tests, you will need to read and confirm the safety prompts. Once you are done doing so, you will be able to run the individual tests.

Image 3.4: “Initial Commissioning - Automatic tests” screen

# Motor phase test

A motor phase check has been implemented which permits monitoring of the motor wiring. It also checks whether the parameter setting of the pulses per revolution of the encoder and the number of pole pairs of the resolver match the number of pole pairs of the motor. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed. Disable motor brake during the motor phase test.

# Determining the encoder offset

Once the safety notice window has been confirmed, the wizard is activated to determine the encoder offset. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed.

# 3.3 Motor

Once the safety notice window has been confirmed, the wizard is activated to determine the mass inertia. When it has been successfully determined, a green tick (check-mark) is displayed.

See also Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111.

The power stages of the Servo Drive can be operated with different voltages and switching frequencies. The list boxes in the screen are used to adapt the power stage to the application conditions.

NOTE

- Any changes to parameters must be saved in the device.
- The setting is only applied on the device after a power off/on cycle.
- If the power stage parameters are changed, the rated currents, overload values and brake chopper thresholds may also change.
