# 7.11.7 Pressure control

The pressure is controlled by a PI pressure controller using P 2850 - HYD_PressCon based on the pressure setpoint. Here you can choose between two controller structures using P 2840 [16] AltPressCon. The selection PressCon_nPump(0) outputs a pump speed at the output of the controller which is directly forwarded to the speed controller (see Image 7.67: Mask of pressure control with pump speed output). The selection PressCon_VolFlow(2) has a volumetric flow rate output in l/min and an underlying volume flow control which takes the displacement volume of the pump into account (see Image 7.68: Mask of pressure control with volumetric flow rate output.). This can be helpful for pumps with a variable displacement volume, as this means the control circuit gain remains unchanged and the controller parameters do not need to be adjusted. If during operation of the pressure control one of the specified limit values P 2850 [7] - Qmin or P 2850 [8] - Qmax is reached due to the pump speed, the actuating variable (motor speed) is limited accordingly. Moreover, the configured speed limits (P 2851.5 nMin, P2851.6 nMax) for the pump always take priority. In addition, it is possible to set the minimum and maximum system pressure via a pressure limitation. To take into account the different area ratio of a differential cylinder, the actual pressure values can be scaled to the respective area ratio using UnitScale_pAct and UnitScale_pAct2 (P 2850.12 pActScale, P 2850.13 pAct2Scale). For control systems with high dynamic performance, it may be necessary to take into account a pressure-dependent compressibility in the control system. ",Which control modes implement the scaling function for pressure limit according to Table 7.73?,"PressCon(0), VolConPlim(1), and SpdCon_pLimit implement the scaling function for pressure limit.","The scaling function for pressure limit is implemented in PressCon(0), VolConPlim(1), and SpdCon_pLimit modes.","According to Table 7.73, PressCon(0), VolConPlim(1), and SpdCon_pLimit have the scaling function for pressure limit.","Three control modes implement the pressure limit scaling: PressCon(0), VolConPlim(1), and SpdCon_pLimit.","For pressure limit scaling, look to PressCon(0), VolConPlim(1), and SpdCon_pLimit in Table 7.73."

# 7.11.7 Pressure control

The pressure is controlled by a PI pressure controller using P 2850 - HYD_PressCon based on the pressure setpoint. Here you can choose between two controller structures using P 2840 [16] AltPressCon. The selection PressCon_nPump(0) outputs a pump speed at the output of the controller which is directly forwarded to the speed controller (see Image 7.67: Mask of pressure control with pump speed output). The selection PressCon_VolFlow(2) has a volumetric flow rate output in l/min and an underlying volume flow control which takes the displacement volume of the pump into account (see Image 7.68: Mask of pressure control with volumetric flow rate output.). This can be helpful for pumps with a variable displacement volume, as this means the control circuit gain remains unchanged and the controller parameters do not need to be adjusted. If during operation of the pressure control one of the specified limit values P 2850 [7] - Qmin or P 2850 [8] - Qmax is reached due to the pump speed, the actuating variable (motor speed) is limited accordingly. Moreover, the configured speed limits (P 2851.5 nMin, P2851.6 nMax) for the pump always take priority. In addition, it is possible to set the minimum and maximum system pressure via a pressure limitation. To take into account the different area ratio of a differential cylinder, the actual pressure values can be scaled to the respective area ratio using UnitScale_pAct and UnitScale_pAct2 (P 2850.12 pActScale, P 2850.13 pAct2Scale). For control systems with high dynamic performance, it may be necessary to take into account a pressure-dependent compressibility in the control system. ",How can the actual pressure values be scaled for a differential cylinder?,"Actual pressure values can be scaled using UnitScale_pAct and UnitScale_pAct2 (P 2850.12 pActScale, P 2850.13 pAct2Scale) to account for the area ratio.","Scaling is achieved through UnitScale_pAct and UnitScale_pAct2 (P 2850.12 pActScale, P 2850.13 pAct2Scale) for the differential cylinder's area ratio.","To scale pressure values for a differential cylinder, use P 2850.12 pActScale and P 2850.13 pAct2Scale.",The parameters P 2850.12 pActScale and P 2850.13 pAct2Scale allow scaling of pressure values based on the area ratio.,"For differential cylinders, scaling pressure values involves P 2850.12 pActScale and P 2850.13 pAct2Scale to adjust for area ratio."
