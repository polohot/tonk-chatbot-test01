# 6.13 Increment-coded reference marks

In the case of encoders with increment-coded reference marks, multiple reference marks are distributed evenly across the entire travel distance. The absolute position information, relative to a specific zero point of the measurement system, is determined by counting the individual measuring increments between two reference marks. The absolute position of the scale defined by the reference mark is assigned to precisely one measuring increment. Before an absolute reference can be created or the last selected reference point found, the reference mark must be passed over. In the worst-case scenario this requires a rotation of up to 360°. To determine the reference position over the shortest possible distance, encoders with increment-coded reference marks are supported (e.g. HEIDENHAIN ROD 280C).

The reference mark track contains multiple reference marks with defined increment differences. The tracking electronics determines the absolute reference when two adjacent reference marks are passed over after just a few degrees of rotation.

# 6.14 Overflow in multi-turn range

With this function the multi-turn range can be shifted in order to avoid a possible overflow. The function is available for encoder channels 1 and 3.

# Example

If a portion of the travel distance is to the left of the threshold (MT Base), it is appended to the end of the travel range (to the right of the 2048) via parameter P 547[0] - ENC_CH1_MTBase for encoder channel 1 and P 584[0] - ENC_CH3_ for encoder channel 3 (unit: increments).

For more information see Section ""Main parameters for encoder channel Ch1"" on page 60 and Section ""Sin/Cos incremental encoders with absolute value interface"" on page 65.

# 6.14 Overflow in multi-turn range

With this function the multi-turn range can be shifted in order to avoid a possible overflow. The function is available for encoder channels 1 and 3.

# Example

If a portion of the travel distance is to the left of the threshold (MT Base), it is appended to the end of the travel range (to the right of the 2048) via parameter P 547[0] - ENC_CH1_MTBase for encoder channel 1 and P 584[0] - ENC_CH3_ for encoder channel 3 (unit: increments).

For more information see Section ""Main parameters for encoder channel Ch1"" on page 60 and Section ""Sin/Cos incremental encoders with absolute value interface"" on page 65.

# 6.13 Increment-coded reference marks

In the case of encoders with increment-coded reference marks, multiple reference marks are distributed evenly across the entire travel distance. The absolute position information, relative to a specific zero point of the measurement system, is determined by counting the individual measuring increments between two reference marks. The absolute position of the scale defined by the reference mark is assigned to precisely one measuring increment. Before an absolute reference can be created or the last selected reference point found, the reference mark must be passed over. In the worst-case scenario this requires a rotation of up to 360°. To determine the reference position over the shortest possible distance, encoders with increment-coded reference marks are supported (e.g. HEIDENHAIN ROD 280C).

The reference mark track contains multiple reference marks with defined increment differences. The tracking electronics determines the absolute reference when two adjacent reference marks are passed over after just a few degrees of rotation.
