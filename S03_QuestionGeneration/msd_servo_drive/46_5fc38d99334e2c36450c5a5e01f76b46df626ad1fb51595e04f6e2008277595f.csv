The absolute position is assigned to precisely one measuring increment relative to a specific zero point of the measurement system. To establish an absolute reference, the reference mark must be passed over, which may require a rotation of up to 360째. The tracking electronics then determines the absolute reference when two adjacent reference marks are passed over after just a few degrees of rotation."

Specifically, it allows for the configuration of how many increments are represented between the basic increments, which are the fundamental units of measurement for the encoder. For example, a sector increment difference of +1, +2, +3, and +4 indicates the number of increments that can be counted between two adjacent reference marks. This configuration ensures that the encoder can accurately determine the absolute position by counting these increments, thereby facilitating precise measurement and control in applications that utilize the encoder."

1. For encoder channel 1, adjust the parameter P 547[0] - ENC_CH1_MTBase. This parameter defines the point of discontinuity in the multi-turn range.

2. For encoder channel 3, adjust the parameter P 584[0] - ENC_CH3_MTBase, which also defines the point of discontinuity in the multi-turn range.

By setting these parameters appropriately, you can append a portion of the travel distance that is to the left of the threshold (MT Base) to the end of the travel range (to the right of the 2048 increments). This helps in managing the multi-turn range effectively and prevents overflow."

This means that the number of measuring increments (or lines) defined by the basic increment determines how many increments are counted during a full rotation of the encoder. For example, if the basic increment is defined as 1000 lines, then one complete mechanical revolution would consist of 1000 increments.

- The number of basic marks and coded marks is indicated in the table, where it states that for a configuration of 18 x 1000 lines, there are 18 basic marks and 18 coded marks, resulting in a total of 36 reference marks.
- The basic increment (G) is specified as a nominal increment (A) corresponding to 1000 lines, which is associated with a rotation of 20째. 
- The increment-coded reference measure (B) is defined as having 1001 lines, which allows for finer resolution in determining the absolute position between reference marks.
- The zero point for the encoder is parameterized as P 542[0] - ENC_CH1_Lines, which is used to enter the number of lines (e.g., 18 x 1000).

It is recommended to consult with a project supervisor or the Moog Helpline to ensure that the encoder does not dramatically exceed the specified limit frequencies when oversampling units are used.

Here are the key aspects of how this design enhances accuracy:

1. **Even Distribution of Reference Marks**: Increment-coded reference marks are distributed evenly across the entire travel distance, which allows for consistent and reliable position referencing throughout the entire range of motion.

2. **Counting Measuring Increments**: The absolute position is determined by counting the individual measuring increments between two reference marks. This counting mechanism ensures that the position can be accurately tracked based on the number of increments passed, reducing the likelihood of errors in position measurement.

3. **Short Distance Reference Positioning**: The design allows for the determination of the reference position over the shortest possible distance. By using encoders with increment-coded reference marks, the system can quickly establish the reference point after passing over two adjacent reference marks, which minimizes the potential for error during the homing process.

4. **Defined Increment Differences**: The reference mark track contains multiple reference marks with defined increment differences, which helps in maintaining precision. The tracking electronics can accurately determine the absolute reference when these marks are passed, ensuring that the system can achieve high accuracy in position measurement.

5. **Support for Mechanical Revolutions**: The design ensures that one mechanical revolution corresponds to a whole multiple of the basic increment, which further enhances the accuracy of the position measurement by providing a clear and consistent framework for interpreting the encoder's output.

Overall, the increment-coded reference marks facilitate precise tracking of position changes, reduce ambiguity in measurement, and enhance the reliability of the system's performance."

It defines the zero point for the encoder, indicating how many measuring increments are present in one mechanical revolution. In the context provided, it is associated with the basic increment of the encoder, which is essential for determining the absolute position based on the reference marks."

1. **Understanding the Reference Marks**: The encoders with increment-coded reference marks have multiple reference marks evenly distributed across the entire travel distance. Each reference mark corresponds to a specific position in the measurement system.

2. **Counting Increments**: To determine the absolute position, you need to count the individual measuring increments between two adjacent reference marks. This counting process allows you to establish the absolute position relative to a defined zero point of the measurement system.

3. **Passing Over Reference Marks**: Before you can create an absolute reference or find the last selected reference point, the system must pass over a reference mark. In the worst-case scenario, this may require a rotation of up to 360째.

4. **Utilizing Tracking Electronics**: The tracking electronics in the encoder will determine the absolute reference once two adjacent reference marks are passed over after a minimal rotation. This ensures that the absolute position is accurately established.

5. **Setting Parameters**: In the encoder configuration, parameters such as the number of lines (e.g., P 542[0] - ENC_CH1_Lines) must be set correctly to reflect the number of increments and reference marks used in the system.

By following these steps, you can effectively create an absolute reference using increment-coded reference marks in an encoder system."
