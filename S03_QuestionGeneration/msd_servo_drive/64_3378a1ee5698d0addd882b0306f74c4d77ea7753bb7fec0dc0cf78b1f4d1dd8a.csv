This involves setting a range of acceptable positions (using parameters such as P 2870.0 PosWindowLo and P 2870.1 PosWindowUp) within which the actual position can fluctuate without triggering a correction. When the actual position reaches this defined window, the motion is stopped, and the cylinder is tensioned by switching off the directional valves. Additionally, a hysteresis can be defined (using parameter P 2870.6) to further prevent readjustment, ensuring that the system does not continuously correct the position unless it moves outside of the specified hysteresis range."

1. **Consider Cylinder Geometry**: Since the geometry of the cylinder affects the volumetric flow and control paths, it is essential to take into account the different surfaces of the cylinder chambers.

2. **Use of Scaling Parameters**: Adjust the control parameters of the position control using specific parameters:
   - **KpScale (P 2870.3)**: This parameter can be used to scale the proportional gain based on the surface area of the cylinder.
   - **KpScaleNeg (P 2870.5)**: This parameter can also be used to adjust the proportional gain for negative scaling, which may be necessary depending on the specific characteristics of the cylinder geometry.
