   \[
   \text{Synchronous Speed} = \frac{120 \times \text{Frequency (Hz)}}{\text{Number of Pole Pairs}}

   This means that for a given frequency, increasing the number of pole pairs will decrease the synchronous speed of the motor.

2. **Torque**: The torque produced by a motor is influenced by the magnetic field strength and the number of poles. Generally, more pole pairs can lead to higher torque at lower speeds, as the motor can produce more magnetic interactions. However, the design and application of the motor also play a significant role in how effectively this torque is utilized.

3. **Control and Stability**: Motors with different numbers of pole pairs may require different control strategies and tuning parameters, particularly in applications involving speed and position control. The relationship between pole pairs and the control settings (like gains for speed and position controllers) is crucial for achieving optimal performance.

4. **Efficiency**: The number of pole pairs can also affect the efficiency of the motor. Motors designed with an optimal number of pole pairs for their intended application can operate more efficiently, reducing losses and improving overall performance.

In summary, the number of pole pairs is a fundamental design parameter that affects the speed, torque, control characteristics, and efficiency of a motor, making it a critical consideration in motor performance analysis."
