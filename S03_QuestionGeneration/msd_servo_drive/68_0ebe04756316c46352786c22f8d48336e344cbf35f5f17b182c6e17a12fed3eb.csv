This means that relative movements cannot be executed in this mode. The drive will move directly to the target position, ensuring that the movement is efficient and minimizes travel distance. For example, if the target position is less than 120° or greater than 600°, the drive will calculate the shortest route within the 360° range to reach the specified target position."

This is calculated by taking the target position and subtracting the circumferential length (360°) multiplied by the number of complete revolutions (n). In other words, the drive will approach the target position by moving to the equivalent position within the 360° range."

When switching to the next driving set (either absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. It is important to note that a preset path optimization is ignored while the indexing table is active."

1. **Relative Driving Jobs**: These may relate to either the current target position or the actual position. This means that the drive can calculate the relative movement based on its current position or the position it is targeting.

2. **Travel Distances**: The drive is capable of executing relative driving jobs that involve travel distances greater than the circumferential length of the system. For example, if the circumferential length is 360°, the drive can handle a relative target position of 800°. In this case, starting from a position of 0°, the drive would complete two full revolutions (720°) and then stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

Overall, the drive continues to move at a constant speed regardless of the transmitted target position until the mode is deactivated or overwritten by a new motion task."

In the context of the example provided, the circumferential length is defined as 360°. This means that when a relative target position exceeds the circumferential length, the drive will complete multiple revolutions and stop at the calculated position based on the total movement required.

For instance, if the relative target position is set to 800° and the starting position is 0°, the drive will complete two full revolutions (720°) and then stop at the 80° mark, which is the result of the calculation (800° - 720°). Therefore, the circumferential length allows for the interpretation of relative movements that can exceed a single revolution, enabling the drive to accurately reach positions that are significantly greater than its immediate range."

Weighting involves defining the physical unit and the exponent associated with parameters such as position, speed, force/torque, and acceleration. 

This means that each parameter can have a specific scaling factor and exponent that dictate how the data should be understood and utilized by the system. For example, the scaling factors can adjust the magnitude of the values being transmitted, while the exponents can define how these values are interpreted in relation to their physical units.

1. **Absolute Target Position**:
   - The drive approaches an absolute target position by moving along the shortest path to that position. This means that regardless of the current position, the drive will calculate the most direct route to the specified absolute position.
   - For example, if the target position is less than 120° or greater than 600°, the drive will move directly to that target position within the 360° range.

2. **Relative Target Position**:
   - In contrast, when using a relative target position, the movement is based on the current position or the actual position of the drive. The drive can execute movements that exceed the circumferential length (360°).
   - For instance, if the current position is 0° and the relative target position is set to 800°, the drive will complete two full revolutions (720°) and then stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

Overall, absolute movements are fixed to a specific target, while relative movements are calculated based on the current position and can result in multiple revolutions."

The input revolutions refer to the number of times the load gear is rotated by the motor, while the output revolutions indicate how many times the driven component (such as another gear or mechanism) rotates as a result of that input.

The relationship can be described as follows:

- If the gear ratio is greater than 1, the output revolutions will be less than the input revolutions, indicating that the system is geared down. This means that for every complete rotation of the input gear, the output gear will rotate fewer times.
- Conversely, if the gear ratio is less than 1, the output revolutions will exceed the input revolutions, indicating that the system is geared up. In this case, for every complete rotation of the input gear, the output gear will rotate more times.

\[ \text{Output Revolutions} = \text{Input Revolutions} \times \text{Gear Ratio} \]

1. **Data Interpretation**: The scaling exponent modifies the relationship between the input torque/force values and their effective representation in the system. A higher exponent may result in a more significant amplification or attenuation of the torque/force data, which can lead to more precise control or potentially overshoot in certain applications.

2. **Control Precision**: By adjusting the scaling exponent, users can fine-tune the responsiveness of the servo drive. This can be particularly important in applications requiring high precision, as it allows for better alignment of the drive's output with the actual mechanical requirements of the load.

Specifically, it influences the following aspects:

1. **Non-linearity in Acceleration Response**: The scaling exponent allows for non-linear adjustments to the acceleration data. By modifying the exponent, the system can either amplify or dampen the effect of acceleration commands, leading to more precise control over how quickly the servo drive accelerates or decelerates.

2. **Tuning Performance**: Adjusting the exponent can help in tuning the performance of the servo drive for specific applications. For instance, a higher exponent may lead to faster acceleration in response to input commands, which can be beneficial in applications requiring quick movements. Conversely, a lower exponent may result in smoother and more gradual acceleration, reducing mechanical stress and improving stability.

3. **Adaptation to Load Conditions**: The scaling exponent can be used to adapt the motion profile based on varying load conditions. For instance, if a heavier load is detected, the exponent can be adjusted to ensure that the servo drive accelerates at a rate that is safe and efficient for the given load, preventing overshoot or instability.

4. **Precision Control**: By fine-tuning the acceleration data scaling exponent, the motion profile can be optimized for precision tasks, where exact positioning and speed control are critical.
