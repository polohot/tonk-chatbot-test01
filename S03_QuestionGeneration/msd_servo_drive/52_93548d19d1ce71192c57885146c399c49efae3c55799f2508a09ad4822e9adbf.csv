“Table 2” has 8 data points for the field-weakening current component with an equidistant spacing between two limit speeds.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE2(5)

The lower limit speed is P 342[0] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], and the upper limit speed is P 342[1] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[1]. Both numerical values for the limits speeds are standardized relative to the nominal speed of the motor (MOT_SNom).

The table values for the field-weakening current component (-id) are specified via P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0..7] and standardized to sqrt(2)*CON_FM_Imag. The interpolation values are calculated using linear interpolation.

P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] and CON_FM_ImagTab[7] are used for extrapolation outside of the limit speeds.

# 7.7.3 Variant 4 (TableMotGen)

A table that differentiates between motor and regenerative mode is used.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE_MOT_GEN(4)

Parameter P-343 CON_FM_ImagTab can be used to configure 16 elements.

# 7.7.5 Variants 3 and 6 (LUT)

For motors with different inductances on the d and q axis, such as an IPMSM (interior permanent magnet synchronous machine), a reluctance torque which is dependent on the d and q current can be built up. A result of the exploitation of this torque is that the control by means of q current alone (id is reduced to 0) (typical for non-salient pole PMSM) is no longer adequate to make use of the machine’s full potential. Consequently, special control structures are implemented in the MSD Servo Drive to ensure optimal control for motors of this nature.

The control works in almost the same way as for the standard control circuit of a PMSM, except that the direct axis ref. current is no longer zero, but instead, both currents are dependent on the reference torque and the actual speed. To accomplish this, the standard control circuit is enhanced to include generation of a current reference value in the form of a LookUpTable (LUT). The current reference value is generated by specifying the associated d and q currents based on the target specification for the torque and the actual speed.

Notes:

1. If you do not want to have field weakening (id=0) for low speeds |n| <= P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], then P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] must be set to 0% (extrapolation below P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0] with a value of 0).
2. The values in P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[2..7] and P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[8..15] are not used in this mode.

The large table has a variable size for the performance map which can be set for a minimum of [3x3] to a maximum of [128x128] table entries. It is specified externally to the servo drive. Negative torques are also possible.

Two LUTs of different sizes (small and large table) are implemented for this purpose. Activate large LUT: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = LUText(6)

Each of these tables has two performance maps, one for the direct axis ref. current and one for the q-current reference values. Each are dependent on the actual speed ‘nact’ (x-direction) and the target torque ‘Tset’ (y-direction): field[x*y].

# Small table

The large table is not generated in the servo drive. It must be provided to the servo drive from an external source (referred to as an “external LUT”). This can be accomplished via the parameter interface described here.

For further procedure, see also section ""Internal calculation of the small table"" on page 152.

# NOTE

During the internal calculation of the small table, only map fields for positive speeds and torques are calculated.

# 7.7.5.3 Saving the large table to ROM

The large table can be transferred from the volatile RAM memory of the device to the non-volatile FLASH memory in the servo drive in two ways. The next time the device is started up, the reverse process is then carried out so that the large table is available immediately.

A.) Save the parameters, for example via Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 (MDA5)

Saving the large table to the flash memory takes place concurrently to the process of saving the device parameters, for example using the “Save setting persistently in device (RAM to ROM)” button in the MDA5.

The parameter behind this procedure is P 11[0]:

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

# B.) Targeted saving of a special parameter using a save command

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.

“Table 2” has 8 data points for the field-weakening current component with an equidistant spacing between two limit speeds.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE2(5)

The lower limit speed is P 342[0] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], and the upper limit speed is P 342[1] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[1]. Both numerical values for the limits speeds are standardized relative to the nominal speed of the motor (MOT_SNom).

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE_MOT_GEN(4)

Parameter P-343 CON_FM_ImagTab can be used to configure 16 elements.

# 7.7.5 Variants 3 and 6 (LUT)

For motors with different inductances on the d and q axis, such as an IPMSM (interior permanent magnet synchronous machine), a reluctance torque which is dependent on the d and q current can be built up. A result of the exploitation of this torque is that the control by means of q current alone (id is reduced to 0) (typical for non-salient pole PMSM) is no longer adequate to make use of the machine’s full potential. Consequently, special control structures are implemented in the MSD Servo Drive to ensure optimal control for motors of this nature.

The control works in almost the same way as for the standard control circuit of a PMSM, except that the direct axis ref. current is no longer zero, but instead, both currents are dependent on the reference torque and the actual speed. To accomplish this, the standard control circuit is enhanced to include generation of a current reference value in the form of a LookUpTable (LUT). The current reference value is generated by specifying the associated d and q currents based on the target specification for the torque and the actual speed.

Notes:

1. If you do not want to have field weakening (id=0) for low speeds |n| <= P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], then P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] must be set to 0% (extrapolation below P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0] with a value of 0).
2. The values in P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[2..7] and P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[8..15] are not used in this mode.

The large table has a variable size for the performance map which can be set for a minimum of [3x3] to a maximum of [128x128] table entries. It is specified externally to the servo drive. Negative torques are also possible.

Two LUTs of different sizes (small and large table) are implemented for this purpose. Activate large LUT: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = LUText(6)

Each of these tables has two performance maps, one for the direct axis ref. current and one for the q-current reference values. Each are dependent on the actual speed ‘nact’ (x-direction) and the target torque ‘Tset’ (y-direction): field[x*y].

# Small table

Table 7.34: Parameter interface for accessing the LUT

The large table is not generated in the servo drive. It must be provided to the servo drive from an external source (referred to as an “external LUT”). This can be accomplished via the parameter interface described here.

For further procedure, see also section ""Internal calculation of the small table"" on page 152.

# NOTE

During the internal calculation of the small table, only map fields for positive speeds and torques are calculated.

# 7.7.5.3 Saving the large table to ROM

The large table can be transferred from the volatile RAM memory of the device to the non-volatile FLASH memory in the servo drive in two ways. The next time the device is started up, the reverse process is then carried out so that the large table is available immediately.

A.) Save the parameters, for example via Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 (MDA5)

Saving the large table to the flash memory takes place concurrently to the process of saving the device parameters, for example using the “Save setting persistently in device (RAM to ROM)” button in the MDA5.

The parameter behind this procedure is P 11[0]:

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

# B.) Targeted saving of a special parameter using a save command

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.

Table 7.34: Parameter interface for accessing the LUT

The large table is not generated in the servo drive. It must be provided to the servo drive from an external source (referred to as an “external LUT”). This can be accomplished via the parameter interface described here.

For further procedure, see also section ""Internal calculation of the small table"" on page 152.

# NOTE

During the internal calculation of the small table, only map fields for positive speeds and torques are calculated.

# 7.7.5.3 Saving the large table to ROM

The large table can be transferred from the volatile RAM memory of the device to the non-volatile FLASH memory in the servo drive in two ways. The next time the device is started up, the reverse process is then carried out so that the large table is available immediately.

A.) Save the parameters, for example via Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 (MDA5)

Saving the large table to the flash memory takes place concurrently to the process of saving the device parameters, for example using the “Save setting persistently in device (RAM to ROM)” button in the MDA5.

The parameter behind this procedure is P 11[0]:

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

# B.) Targeted saving of a special parameter using a save command

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.

- Very fast adaptations, with high dynamism, are possible (open-loop control method).
- Motor parameters must be known quite precisely.
- If continuous oscillation occurs (voltage limit) the preset negative d-current value is then not sufficient. Scaling parameter P 436[0] - CON_FW_SpeedScale > 100% is used to evaluate the map at higher speeds.

“Table 2” has 8 data points for the field-weakening current component with an equidistant spacing between two limit speeds.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE2(5)

The lower limit speed is P 342[0] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], and the upper limit speed is P 342[1] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[1]. Both numerical values for the limits speeds are standardized relative to the nominal speed of the motor (MOT_SNom).

The table values for the field-weakening current component (-id) are specified via P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0..7] and standardized to sqrt(2)*CON_FM_Imag. The interpolation values are calculated using linear interpolation.

P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] and CON_FM_ImagTab[7] are used for extrapolation outside of the limit speeds.

# 7.7.3 Variant 4 (TableMotGen)

A table that differentiates between motor and regenerative mode is used.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE_MOT_GEN(4)

Parameter P-343 CON_FM_ImagTab can be used to configure 16 elements.

# 7.7.5 Variants 3 and 6 (LUT)

For motors with different inductances on the d and q axis, such as an IPMSM (interior permanent magnet synchronous machine), a reluctance torque which is dependent on the d and q current can be built up. A result of the exploitation of this torque is that the control by means of q current alone (id is reduced to 0) (typical for non-salient pole PMSM) is no longer adequate to make use of the machine’s full potential. Consequently, special control structures are implemented in the MSD Servo Drive to ensure optimal control for motors of this nature.

The control works in almost the same way as for the standard control circuit of a PMSM, except that the direct axis ref. current is no longer zero, but instead, both currents are dependent on the reference torque and the actual speed. To accomplish this, the standard control circuit is enhanced to include generation of a current reference value in the form of a LookUpTable (LUT). The current reference value is generated by specifying the associated d and q currents based on the target specification for the torque and the actual speed.

Notes:

1. If you do not want to have field weakening (id=0) for low speeds |n| <= P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], then P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] must be set to 0% (extrapolation below P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0] with a value of 0).
2. The values in P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[2..7] and P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[8..15] are not used in this mode.

The large table has a variable size for the performance map which can be set for a minimum of [3x3] to a maximum of [128x128] table entries. It is specified externally to the servo drive. Negative torques are also possible.

Two LUTs of different sizes (small and large table) are implemented for this purpose. Activate large LUT: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = LUText(6)

Each of these tables has two performance maps, one for the direct axis ref. current and one for the q-current reference values. Each are dependent on the actual speed ‘nact’ (x-direction) and the target torque ‘Tset’ (y-direction): field[x*y].

# Small table

Selecting the small table:

- Parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2].Table select = 0 (internal LUT).

Selecting the large table:

- Parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2].Table select = 1 (external LUT).

Selecting the index for the speed:

- Parameter P 421[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[0].Speed index select.

Selecting the index for the torque:

- Parameter P 421[1] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[1].Torque index select.

Table value of the LUT for the d current:

- Parameter P 422[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabId - Id in A.

Table value of the LUT for the q current:

- Parameter P 423[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabIq - Iq in A.

Table 7.34: Parameter interface for accessing the LUT

The large table is not generated in the servo drive. It must be provided to the servo drive from an external source (referred to as an “external LUT”). This can be accomplished via the parameter interface described here.

For further procedure, see also section ""Internal calculation of the small table"" on page 152.

# NOTE

During the internal calculation of the small table, only map fields for positive speeds and torques are calculated.

# 7.7.5.3 Saving the large table to ROM

The large table can be transferred from the volatile RAM memory of the device to the non-volatile FLASH memory in the servo drive in two ways. The next time the device is started up, the reverse process is then carried out so that the large table is available immediately.

A.) Save the parameters, for example via Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 (MDA5)

Saving the large table to the flash memory takes place concurrently to the process of saving the device parameters, for example using the “Save setting persistently in device (RAM to ROM)” button in the MDA5.

The parameter behind this procedure is P 11[0]:

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

# B.) Targeted saving of a special parameter using a save command

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.

- Very fast adaptations, with high dynamism, are possible (open-loop control method).
- Motor parameters must be known quite precisely.
- If continuous oscillation occurs (voltage limit) the preset negative d-current value is then not sufficient. Scaling parameter P 436[0] - CON_FW_SpeedScale > 100% is used to evaluate the map at higher speeds.

“Table 2” has 8 data points for the field-weakening current component with an equidistant spacing between two limit speeds.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE2(5)

The lower limit speed is P 342[0] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], and the upper limit speed is P 342[1] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[1]. Both numerical values for the limits speeds are standardized relative to the nominal speed of the motor (MOT_SNom).

The table values for the field-weakening current component (-id) are specified via P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0..7] and standardized to sqrt(2)*CON_FM_Imag. The interpolation values are calculated using linear interpolation.

P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] and CON_FM_ImagTab[7] are used for extrapolation outside of the limit speeds.

# 7.7.3 Variant 4 (TableMotGen)

A table that differentiates between motor and regenerative mode is used.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE_MOT_GEN(4)

Parameter P-343 CON_FM_ImagTab can be used to configure 16 elements.

# 7.7.5 Variants 3 and 6 (LUT)

For motors with different inductances on the d and q axis, such as an IPMSM (interior permanent magnet synchronous machine), a reluctance torque which is dependent on the d and q current can be built up. A result of the exploitation of this torque is that the control by means of q current alone (id is reduced to 0) (typical for non-salient pole PMSM) is no longer adequate to make use of the machine’s full potential. Consequently, special control structures are implemented in the MSD Servo Drive to ensure optimal control for motors of this nature.

The control works in almost the same way as for the standard control circuit of a PMSM, except that the direct axis ref. current is no longer zero, but instead, both currents are dependent on the reference torque and the actual speed. To accomplish this, the standard control circuit is enhanced to include generation of a current reference value in the form of a LookUpTable (LUT). The current reference value is generated by specifying the associated d and q currents based on the target specification for the torque and the actual speed.

Notes:

1. If you do not want to have field weakening (id=0) for low speeds |n| <= P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], then P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] must be set to 0% (extrapolation below P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0] with a value of 0).
2. The values in P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[2..7] and P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[8..15] are not used in this mode.

The large table has a variable size for the performance map which can be set for a minimum of [3x3] to a maximum of [128x128] table entries. It is specified externally to the servo drive. Negative torques are also possible.

Two LUTs of different sizes (small and large table) are implemented for this purpose. Activate large LUT: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = LUText(6)

Each of these tables has two performance maps, one for the direct axis ref. current and one for the q-current reference values. Each are dependent on the actual speed ‘nact’ (x-direction) and the target torque ‘Tset’ (y-direction): field[x*y].

# Small table

The d/q current values are now calculated and the small table is filled with the results. Afterwards, access to the table entries of the respective table field is possible.

The small table is not saved to the controller’s ROM. Instead, it is re-calculated when the servo drive is started or a re-initialization takes place and the results are saved to RAM.

# 7.7.5.2 Parameter interface for accessing the d/q current values of the LUT

Access to the values of the LUT can be carried out via parameters P 421, P 422 and P423:

Selecting the small table:

- Parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2].Table select = 0 (internal LUT).

Selecting the large table:

- Parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2].Table select = 1 (external LUT).

Selecting the index for the speed:

- Parameter P 421[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[0].Speed index select.

Selecting the index for the torque:

- Parameter P 421[1] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[1].Torque index select.

Table value of the LUT for the d current:

- Parameter P 422[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabId - Id in A.

Table value of the LUT for the q current:

- Parameter P 423[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabIq - Iq in A.

Table 7.34: Parameter interface for accessing the LUT

The large table is not generated in the servo drive. It must be provided to the servo drive from an external source (referred to as an “external LUT”). This can be accomplished via the parameter interface described here.

For further procedure, see also section ""Internal calculation of the small table"" on page 152.

# NOTE

During the internal calculation of the small table, only map fields for positive speeds and torques are calculated.

# 7.7.5.3 Saving the large table to ROM

The large table can be transferred from the volatile RAM memory of the device to the non-volatile FLASH memory in the servo drive in two ways. The next time the device is started up, the reverse process is then carried out so that the large table is available immediately.

A.) Save the parameters, for example via Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 (MDA5)

Saving the large table to the flash memory takes place concurrently to the process of saving the device parameters, for example using the “Save setting persistently in device (RAM to ROM)” button in the MDA5.

The parameter behind this procedure is P 11[0]:

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

# B.) Targeted saving of a special parameter using a save command

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.

- Very fast adaptations, with high dynamism, are possible (open-loop control method).
- Motor parameters must be known quite precisely.
- If continuous oscillation occurs (voltage limit) the preset negative d-current value is then not sufficient. Scaling parameter P 436[0] - CON_FW_SpeedScale > 100% is used to evaluate the map at higher speeds.

# 7.7.4 Variant 5 (TABLE2)

“Table 2” has 8 data points for the field-weakening current component with an equidistant spacing between two limit speeds.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE2(5)

The lower limit speed is P 342[0] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], and the upper limit speed is P 342[1] - CON_FM_SpeedTab[1]. Both numerical values for the limits speeds are standardized relative to the nominal speed of the motor (MOT_SNom).

The table values for the field-weakening current component (-id) are specified via P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0..7] and standardized to sqrt(2)*CON_FM_Imag. The interpolation values are calculated using linear interpolation.

P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] and CON_FM_ImagTab[7] are used for extrapolation outside of the limit speeds.

# 7.7.3 Variant 4 (TableMotGen)

A table that differentiates between motor and regenerative mode is used.

Activate table: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = TABLE_MOT_GEN(4)

Parameter P-343 CON_FM_ImagTab can be used to configure 16 elements.

# 7.7.5 Variants 3 and 6 (LUT)

For motors with different inductances on the d and q axis, such as an IPMSM (interior permanent magnet synchronous machine), a reluctance torque which is dependent on the d and q current can be built up. A result of the exploitation of this torque is that the control by means of q current alone (id is reduced to 0) (typical for non-salient pole PMSM) is no longer adequate to make use of the machine’s full potential. Consequently, special control structures are implemented in the MSD Servo Drive to ensure optimal control for motors of this nature.

The control works in almost the same way as for the standard control circuit of a PMSM, except that the direct axis ref. current is no longer zero, but instead, both currents are dependent on the reference torque and the actual speed. To accomplish this, the standard control circuit is enhanced to include generation of a current reference value in the form of a LookUpTable (LUT). The current reference value is generated by specifying the associated d and q currents based on the target specification for the torque and the actual speed.

Notes:

1. If you do not want to have field weakening (id=0) for low speeds |n| <= P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0], then P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[0] must be set to 0% (extrapolation below P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[0] with a value of 0).
2. The values in P 342 - CON_FM_SpeedTab[2..7] and P 343 - CON_FM_ImagTab[8..15] are not used in this mode.

The large table has a variable size for the performance map which can be set for a minimum of [3x3] to a maximum of [128x128] table entries. It is specified externally to the servo drive. Negative torques are also possible.

Two LUTs of different sizes (small and large table) are implemented for this purpose. Activate large LUT: P 435[0] - CON_FM_FWMode = LUText(6)

Each of these tables has two performance maps, one for the direct axis ref. current and one for the q-current reference values. Each are dependent on the actual speed ‘nact’ (x-direction) and the target torque ‘Tset’ (y-direction): field[x*y].

# Small table

The d/q current values are now calculated and the small table is filled with the results. Afterwards, access to the table entries of the respective table field is possible.

The small table is not saved to the controller’s ROM. Instead, it is re-calculated when the servo drive is started or a re-initialization takes place and the results are saved to RAM.

# 7.7.5.2 Parameter interface for accessing the d/q current values of the LUT

Access to the values of the LUT can be carried out via parameters P 421, P 422 and P423:

Selecting the small table:

- Parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2].Table select = 0 (internal LUT).

Selecting the large table:

- Parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2].Table select = 1 (external LUT).

Selecting the index for the speed:

- Parameter P 421[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[0].Speed index select.

Selecting the index for the torque:

- Parameter P 421[1] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[1].Torque index select.

Table value of the LUT for the d current:

- Parameter P 422[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabId - Id in A.

Table value of the LUT for the q current:

- Parameter P 423[0] - CON_FM_FW_TabIq - Iq in A.

|ID|Index|Name / Setting|Description|Unit|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|P 421|CON_FM_FWTabIdx| | | |
|P 421|0|Speed index select|Selects index for speed| |
|P 421|1|Torque index select|Selects index for torque| |
|P 421|2|Table select|0: Selects small table 1: Selects large table| |
|P 421|3|Command|0: None 1: ClearTable 2: WriteToRom| |
|P 422|CON_FM_FWTabId| |d current table entry|A|
|P 423|CON_FM_FWTabIq| |q current table entry|A|

Table 7.34: Parameter interface for accessing the LUT

The large table is not generated in the servo drive. It must be provided to the servo drive from an external source (referred to as an “external LUT”). This can be accomplished via the parameter interface described here.

For further procedure, see also section ""Internal calculation of the small table"" on page 152.

# NOTE

During the internal calculation of the small table, only map fields for positive speeds and torques are calculated.

# 7.7.5.3 Saving the large table to ROM

The large table can be transferred from the volatile RAM memory of the device to the non-volatile FLASH memory in the servo drive in two ways. The next time the device is started up, the reverse process is then carried out so that the large table is available immediately.

A.) Save the parameters, for example via Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 (MDA5)

Saving the large table to the flash memory takes place concurrently to the process of saving the device parameters, for example using the “Save setting persistently in device (RAM to ROM)” button in the MDA5.

The parameter behind this procedure is P 11[0]:

Parameter P11[0] - PARA_SetCmd[0].Save = Active(1)

In contrast to the parameter values that are transferred to the NVRAM in the servo drive, the values of the large table are transferred to the flash memory in the servo drive.

# B.) Targeted saving of a special parameter using a save command

Command: Save large table to flash memory:

Parameter P 421[3] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[3].Command = WriteToROM(2)

This command only works for the large table: Select the table using parameter P 421[2] - CON_FM_FW_TabIdx[2]. Table select (small or large) is redundant in this case.
