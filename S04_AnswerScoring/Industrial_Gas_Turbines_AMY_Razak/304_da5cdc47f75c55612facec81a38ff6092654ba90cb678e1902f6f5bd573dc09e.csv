The effect of the VIGV opening on the compressor characteristic is shown in Figs 20.15 and 20.16. During the open loop response, the VIGV control system opens the VIGV fully and remains opened fully for a fixed period of time (15 seconds). The compressor characteristic changes from the fully closed position to the fully opened position of the VIGV and the change in the compressor characteristic (Fig. 20.15) is similar to that shown in Fig. ",Why is the change in compressor characteristic important?,A2,The change signifies the VIGV's effect on compressor efficiency and behavior.,1.6484375,1.671875,3.140625,1.1015625,0.08154296875

These small differences in outputs may be ironed out or trimmed by setting the EGT limit for VIGV operation to be slightly lower than the maximum EGT limit, thus enabling the required power demand to be met. The effect of trimming the VIGV movement on the gas turbine power output is shown in Figs 20.12 and 20.14, where the VIGV opens due to the slight decrease in the EGT set point and the power output reaches the generator power demand set point. The EGT limit for VIGV control is reduced by 2 degrees, from the 825 K to 823 K (for trimming). Such small temperature differences will have little impact on engine performance, but will provide a simple and effective means for overcoming control problems associated with variable guide vane systems under these conditions.
