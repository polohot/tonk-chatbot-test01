20.20 Change in air–fuel ratio and flow due to a series of step increases in power demand from the gas turbine.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

20.28 Change in gas turbine power output for a fixed and variable EGT limit with ambient temperature.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

# Exercises using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

# Exercises using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio.

The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius

- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

20.21 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power.

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

20.20 Change in air–fuel ratio and flow due to a series of step increases in power demand from the gas turbine.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:

- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.

- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

20.28 Change in gas turbine power output for a fixed and variable EGT limit with ambient temperature.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

The following exercises (1–46) use the single-shaft gas turbine simulator on the CD accompanying this book. The default values given in the simulator and the generator power demand set to 60 MW should be used unless other input values are specifically stated.

# 21.1 Effects of ambient temperature and pressure on engine performance

1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power and thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. What is the creep life usage of the turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine?

Determine the emissions from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/day.
2. The engine operating at site has the following conditions:
- ambient temperature 15 degrees Celsius
- ambient pressure 1.013 Bar
- inlet and exhaust loss of 100 mm water gauge

Determine the parameters in Exercise 1 above and calculate the percentage changes in the parameters when operating at site rated conditions. Explain the changes in the turbine life usage.
3. Determine the percentage changes in the parameters in Exercise 1 when
1. the ambient temperature is 30 degrees Celsius
2. the ambient temperature is zero degrees Celsius
3. the ambient temperature is –15 degrees Celsius

# Simulation exercises

What limits the power output from the gas turbine when operating at these ambient temperatures? Repeat this exercise using the control system Option 2. Comment on the operation of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) at these ambient conditions.

1. When operating at site rated conditions as stipulated in Exercise 2, determine the parameters in Exercise 1 when the ambient pressure is 0.975 Bar and calculate the percentage change from the values determined in Exercise 1.
2. When the required power output from the generator is 37 MW and the ambient pressure and temperature, are 0.975 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively, determine the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. If the ambient pressure increases to 1.03 Bar, explain why the thermal efficiency decreases and explain the changes in the turbine creep life usage and emissions.
3. Produce a graph describing the maximum gas turbine power output with ambient temperature, indicating which engine parameter restricts the capacity of the gas turbine at different ambient temperatures. Also, determine the ambient temperature when the engine power output is limited by exhaust gas temperature and maximum power limit. The variation in ambient temperature should be from 30 to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees.
4. Determine the maximum power output of the gas turbine when the relative humidity is 0.05% and 100%. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius. Repeat the simulation when the ambient temperature is –5 degrees Celsius and comment on the differences.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

It is therefore possible to increase the EGT limit at higher ambient temperatures such that the turbine creep life usage remains approximately constant with the change in ambient temperature. The resultant increase in the EGT limit at high ambient temperatures will increase the power output of the gas turbine at these ambient temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20.28. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output increases by about 3%, compared with the case when the EGT limit remains constant with ambient temperature changes. There is also a useful increase in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine due to the higher EGT limit.

An alternative engine control strategy is to modulate the VIGV in response to a change in power demand and modulate the fuel flow to maintain the EGT on its set point. Such a control strategy is described in Figure 10.11 (Chapter 10) and would eliminate the need for an open loop response or trimming from the control system. However, when the power demand falls

sufficiently the VIGV will remain closed, and the control strategy must shift to modulate the fuel flow to the change in power demand from the gas turbine at these power conditions. During this period of engine operation the air–fuel ratio cannot be maintained and the combustion system switches to a diffusion flame similar to that found in conventional combustion systems. Since this occurs at low power, typically below 65% of the design power output, the high NOₓ emissions during this period of operation are normally of little consequence because the amount of operation at such low power is usually small. Generally, the control of DLE combustion gas turbines is much more complex. At the time of writing, these combustion systems are still being developed to overcome combustion instabilities, which occur quite frequently in production engines. The corresponding figures for the alternative control strategy are shown in Figs 20.22, 20.23, 20.24, 20.25 and 20.26, respectively. It can be seen that the absence of the open loop response gives a steady air–fuel ratio, as shown in Fig. 20.25.

# 20.2.3 Increasing the EGT limit to reduce CO at off-design conditions

The decrease in power results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus a decrease in the turbine pressure ratio. If operation is at a constant EGT at lower power as discussed above, the turbine entry temperature and the combustion temperature decrease as the compressor pressure ratio decreases. The decreases in combustion temperature and pressure will increase

20.26 Increase in turbine creep life usage due to constant EGT operation at low power using alternative control strategy.

A similar strategy may be implemented for single-shaft gas turbines, where the EGT limit is increased at low power conditions to maintain high combustion temperatures, thus minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions. Increasing the EGT limit at reduced power outputs must take into account the increase in creep life usage due to the higher turbine metal temperature. From Fig. 20.26, it is observed that the turbine creep life usage decreases and this is because of the reduced turbine entry temperature and cooling air temperature due to the lower compressor pressure ratios at lower power. Thus the potential to increase the EGT limit at these powers exists, such that the turbine creep life usage remains constant with reducing power, hence minimising CO and UHC emissions at these operating conditions.

# 20.3 Optimisation of the EGT limit for a single-shaft gas turbine with ambient temperature

It has been assumed that the EGT limit remains constant with variation of the ambient temperature for both the single- and the two-shaft gas turbine simulators. This is a reasonable assumption for a two-shaft gas turbine, where the EGT is measured at the exit of the gas generator turbine rather than at the exit of the power turbine. Since the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions in the power turbine, this forces the gas generator turbine to operate at an approximately fixed pressure ratio. Thus, the turbine entry temperature remains essentially constant as does the turbine creep life usage when the engine power output is limited by the EGT. With a single-shaft gas turbine, the EGT is usually measured at

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The exit of the turbine rather than at some intermediate point between the inlet and exit of the turbine. The increase in ambient temperature results in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio and thus in the turbine pressure ratio. For a fixed EGT limit, this results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature and hence a decrease in turbine creep life usage and therefore an increase in the time to next overhaul, as shown in Fig. 20.27.
