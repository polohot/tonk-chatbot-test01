Determine if the decrease in compressor inlet temperature due to turbine inlet cooling is sufficient to improve the thermal efficiency in spite of the decrease in compressor efficiency, or if there is potential to optimise the turbine inlet cooling such that the thermal efficiency can be maximised.
