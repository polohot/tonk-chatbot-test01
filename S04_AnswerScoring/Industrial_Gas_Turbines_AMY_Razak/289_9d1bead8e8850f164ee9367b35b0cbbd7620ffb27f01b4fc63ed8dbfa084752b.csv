# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.

The increase in the VIGV position to maintain the EGT on its set point during hot end damage is shown as a trend in Fig. 18.42. The VIGV opens from about 72% to 92% in order to maintain the EGT on its set point. The

# 18.5.4 Trends in flow

Since the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor mass flow rate. This can be seen in Fig. 18.41, which shows the trends in flows due to hot end damage when operating at low powers.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in fuel flow to maintain the power demand from the generator. To satisfy the increase in fuel flow the fuel valve also opens as shown in Fig. 18.41. From the trends in temperatures it has been seen that a slight decrease in the turbine entry temperature occurs while the compressor discharge temperature remains essentially constant. The air–fuel ratio therefore increases slightly as shown in Fig. 18.41.
