Condensation occurs. When relative humidity reaches 100%, any further cooling produces condensation and this decreases the specific humidity, as shown in Fig. 14.25. Thus, the decrease in specific humidity and the increase in combustion temperature and pressure result in an increase in NOx emissions.

These effects can be simulated and the reader should use the simulator to illustrate these issues. As with wetted media cooling and fogging, it should be noted that the simulator is a useful calculator to determine the cooling load requirements for a given level of turbine inlet cooling. The information can be scaled to suit any gas turbine with either single- and multi-shaft engines.

The choice of cooling technology is not defined very clearly and it depends on the site ambient conditions. Lower humidity tends to favour evaporative cooling technologies such as wetted media and fogging systems, as the amount of turbine inlet air cooling will be significant. Conversely, a high humidity environment will tend to favour chillers; however, parasitic losses will be high. Also, low humidity and very high ambient temperature (above 35 degrees Celsius), as found in desert conditions, will tend to favour chillers. Under these ambient conditions, more inlet air cooling is possible with chillers compared with evaporative cooling and the parasitic loss will be low. Turbine inlet cooling is also applicable in temperate climates, where summertime temperatures and humidity will justify turbine inlet cooling.

Ideally, the increase in engine performance due to turbine inlet cooling needs to be analysed on a day-by-day basis over a long enough period, typically a year, for each type of cooling technology. Another important factor is the capital cost of the turbine inlet cooling system. The capital cost of chillers can be

Condensation occurs. When relative humidity reaches 100%, any further cooling produces condensation and this decreases the specific humidity, as shown in Fig. 14.25. Thus, the decrease in specific humidity and the increase in combustion temperature and pressure result in an increase in NOx emissions.

These effects can be simulated and the reader should use the simulator to illustrate these issues. As with wetted media cooling and fogging, it should be noted that the simulator is a useful calculator to determine the cooling load requirements for a given level of turbine inlet cooling. The information can be scaled to suit any gas turbine with either single- and multi-shaft engines.

The choice of cooling technology is not defined very clearly and it depends on the site ambient conditions. Lower humidity tends to favour evaporative cooling technologies such as wetted media and fogging systems, as the amount of turbine inlet air cooling will be significant. Conversely, a high humidity environment will tend to favour chillers; however, parasitic losses will be high. Also, low humidity and very high ambient temperature (above 35 degrees Celsius), as found in desert conditions, will tend to favour chillers. Under these ambient conditions, more inlet air cooling is possible with chillers compared with evaporative cooling and the parasitic loss will be low. Turbine inlet cooling is also applicable in temperate climates, where summertime temperatures and humidity will justify turbine inlet cooling.

Ideally, the increase in engine performance due to turbine inlet cooling needs to be analysed on a day-by-day basis over a long enough period, typically a year, for each type of cooling technology. Another important factor is the capital cost of the turbine inlet cooling system. The capital cost of chillers can be

Thus, the decrease in specific humidity and the increase in combustion temperature and pressure result in an increase in NOx emissions.

These effects can be simulated and the reader should use the simulator to illustrate these issues. As with wetted media cooling and fogging, it should be noted that the simulator is a useful calculator to determine the cooling load requirements for a given level of turbine inlet cooling. The information can be scaled to suit any gas turbine with either single- and multi-shaft engines.

The choice of cooling technology is not defined very clearly and it depends on the site ambient conditions. Lower humidity tends to favour evaporative cooling technologies such as wetted media and fogging systems, as the amount of turbine inlet air cooling will be significant. Conversely, a high humidity environment will tend to favour chillers; however, parasitic losses will be high. Also, low humidity and very high ambient temperature (above 35 degrees Celsius), as found in desert conditions, will tend to favour chillers. Under these ambient conditions, more inlet air cooling is possible with chillers compared with evaporative cooling and the parasitic loss will be low. Turbine inlet cooling is also applicable in temperate climates, where summertime temperatures and humidity will justify turbine inlet cooling.

Ideally, the increase in engine performance due to turbine inlet cooling needs to be analysed on a day-by-day basis over a long enough period, typically a year, for each type of cooling technology. Another important factor is the capital cost of the turbine inlet cooling system. The capital cost of chillers can be

# Power augmentation

Condensation occurs. When relative humidity reaches 100%, any further cooling produces condensation and this decreases the specific humidity, as shown in Fig. 14.25. Thus, the decrease in specific humidity and the increase in combustion temperature and pressure result in an increase in NOx emissions.

These effects can be simulated and the reader should use the simulator to illustrate these issues. As with wetted media cooling and fogging, it should be noted that the simulator is a useful calculator to determine the cooling load requirements for a given level of turbine inlet cooling. The information can be scaled to suit any gas turbine with either single- and multi-shaft engines.

The choice of cooling technology is not defined very clearly and it depends on the site ambient conditions. Lower humidity tends to favour evaporative cooling technologies such as wetted media and fogging systems, as the amount of turbine inlet air cooling will be significant. Conversely, a high humidity environment will tend to favour chillers; however, parasitic losses will be high. Also, low humidity and very high ambient temperature (above 35 degrees Celsius), as found in desert conditions, will tend to favour chillers. Under these ambient conditions, more inlet air cooling is possible with chillers compared with evaporative cooling and the parasitic loss will be low. Turbine inlet cooling is also applicable in temperate climates, where summertime temperatures and humidity will justify turbine inlet cooling.

Ideally, the increase in engine performance due to turbine inlet cooling needs to be analysed on a day-by-day basis over a long enough period, typically a year, for each type of cooling technology. Another important factor is the capital cost of the turbine inlet cooling system. The capital cost of chillers can be

The ambient temperature and relative humidity are held constant at 30 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively. The increase in specific humidity suppresses the increase in NOₓ emissions, which are due to the increase in combustion temperature and pressure as the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

Condensation occurs. When relative humidity reaches 100%, any further cooling produces condensation and this decreases the specific humidity, as shown in Fig. 14.25. Thus, the decrease in specific humidity and the increase in combustion temperature and pressure result in an increase in NOx emissions.

These effects can be simulated and the reader should use the simulator to illustrate these issues. As with wetted media cooling and fogging, it should be noted that the simulator is a useful calculator to determine the cooling load requirements for a given level of turbine inlet cooling. The information can be scaled to suit any gas turbine with either single- and multi-shaft engines.

The choice of cooling technology is not defined very clearly and it depends on the site ambient conditions. Lower humidity tends to favour evaporative cooling technologies such as wetted media and fogging systems, as the amount of turbine inlet air cooling will be significant. Conversely, a high humidity environment will tend to favour chillers; however, parasitic losses will be high. Also, low humidity and very high ambient temperature (above 35 degrees Celsius), as found in desert conditions, will tend to favour chillers. Under these ambient conditions, more inlet air cooling is possible with chillers compared with evaporative cooling and the parasitic loss will be low. Turbine inlet cooling is also applicable in temperate climates, where summertime temperatures and humidity will justify turbine inlet cooling.

Ideally, the increase in engine performance due to turbine inlet cooling needs to be analysed on a day-by-day basis over a long enough period, typically a year, for each type of cooling technology. Another important factor is the capital cost of the turbine inlet cooling system. The capital cost of chillers can be
