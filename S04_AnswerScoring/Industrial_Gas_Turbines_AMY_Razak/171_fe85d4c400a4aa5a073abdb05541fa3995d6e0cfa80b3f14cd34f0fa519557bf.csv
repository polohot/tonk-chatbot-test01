Highlighted and means to protect the engine during the transient period of operation were discussed. In this section, means of predicting the transient performance of the gas turbine will be discussed.

In predicting the steady-state performance of gas turbines only flow compatibility has been considered, which is effectively the steady-state law of continuity or conservation of mass and the power or energy balance between and within engine components such as compressors, turbines and combustors. Again, only the steady-state aspect of the law of conservation of energy has been considered.

In predicting the steady-state performance of gas turbines only flow compatibility has been considered, which is effectively the steady-state law of continuity or conservation of mass and the power or energy balance between and within engine components such as compressors, turbines and combustors. Again, only the steady-state aspect of the law of conservation of energy has been considered. To simulate the transient performance of the gas turbine it is necessary to consider the dynamic terms present in these laws and also to consider the laws of conservation of momentum. If an engine element in general is considered at any instance in time as shown in Fig. 10.15, it would experience a fluid flow rate, W₁ and W₂, temperatures, Ts₁ and Ts₂, and pressures, Ps₁ and Ps₂, entering the element and leaving the element. Also, there would be external forces, there would be net energy, Enet, on the element. Similarly, net, either entering or leaving the element, as shown in Fig. ",Why is it important to consider dynamic terms in transient performance simulation?,A3,Dynamic terms are vital for reflecting the instantaneous changes during the transient phase in simulations.,1.9453125,1.8359375,3.3125,1.3828125,0.18359375

During the transient response, the operating point will leave the steady-state operating condition and this condition will prevail until the new steady-state condition is reached. Problems such as compressor surge and flameout during these transient excursions have been
