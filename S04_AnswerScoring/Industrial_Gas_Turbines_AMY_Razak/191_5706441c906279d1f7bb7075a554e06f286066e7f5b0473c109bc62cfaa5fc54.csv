temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",At what ambient temperature does the engine become constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed?,A1,Below –12 degrees Celsius.,0.8359375,0.578125,2.953125,0.71484375,-0.0252685546875

The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed.

As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature.

The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",At what ambient temperature does the engine become constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed?,A4,"At ambient temperatures under –12 degrees Celsius, the engine hits its compressor speed limit.",1.453125,1.5625,3.234375,1.203125,0.423828125

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the fuel flow rate change during the ambient temperature transient?,A1,"Increases when performance is controlled by EGT, decreases when controlled by gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed.",1.9375,2.0,3.40625,1.34375,0.330078125

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius.

The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the fuel flow rate change during the ambient temperature transient?,A3,"Initially increases, then decreases as control shifts from EGT to speed parameters.",1.9375,2.0,3.328125,1.125,0.2099609375

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the fuel flow rate change during the ambient temperature transient?,A5,Variation in fuel flow mirrors the transition from EGT to speed-based performance control.,1.1171875,1.3046875,3.015625,1.3984375,0.138671875

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the gas generator speed change with a reduction in ambient temperature?,A2,"The gas generator speed first decreases with ambient temperature drop, then increases as temperatures go lower.",0.83203125,1.1015625,3.09375,1.1484375,0.2421875

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the gas generator speed change with a reduction in ambient temperature?,A4,Change in gas generator speed: initial decrease followed by an increase at lower ambient temperatures.,0.61328125,0.9296875,2.953125,0.94921875,0.1025390625

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the power output of the gas turbine change when the engine is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed?,A1,"Remains essentially constant, as the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.",0.76171875,0.95703125,3.21875,0.9609375,0.220703125

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the power output of the gas turbine change when the engine is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed?,A3,No significant change in power output when limited by compressor non-dimensional speed.,1.0625,0.93359375,3.0,1.0,0.044921875

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",How does the power output of the gas turbine change when the engine is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed?,A5,Constant compressor non-dimensional speed leads to stable power output levels.,1.2421875,1.3671875,3.234375,1.015625,0.07861328125

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What happens to the compressor non-dimensional speed as ambient temperature decreases?,A2,The compressor non-dimensional speed rises as the ambient temperature falls.,1.9375,2.21875,3.4375,1.25,0.259765625

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

# 11.3.2 Compressor characteristic

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What happens to the compressor non-dimensional speed as ambient temperature decreases?,A4,An inverse relationship exists between ambient temperature and compressor non-dimensional speed.,2.0,2.125,3.40625,1.3984375,0.326171875

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the ambient pressure set to during the change in ambient temperature in the simulation?,A1,The ambient pressure is set to 1.013 Bar.,2.453125,2.578125,3.71875,1.0078125,0.1552734375

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the ambient pressure set to during the change in ambient temperature in the simulation?,A3,1.013 Bar is the ambient pressure maintained throughout the ambient temperature change.,2.578125,2.59375,3.515625,1.0625,0.423828125

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

# 11.3.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the ambient pressure set to during the change in ambient temperature in the simulation?,A5,"Ambient pressure: 1.013 Bar, as specified during the temperature variation.",2.125,2.375,3.609375,1.1171875,0.1806640625

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

# 11.3.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of decreasing ambient temperature on the compressor pressure ratio?,A2,"As ambient temperature drops, the compressor pressure ratio rises.",1.3046875,1.640625,3.28125,1.2109375,0.01171875

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed.

Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of decreasing ambient temperature on the compressor pressure ratio?,A4,There's a direct correlation between lower ambient temperatures and higher compressor pressure ratios.,1.7265625,1.796875,3.21875,1.3125,0.302734375

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8.

At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of decreasing ambient temperature on the gas turbine's thermal efficiency?,A1,Thermal efficiency increases as ambient temperature decreases.,2.203125,2.4375,3.625,1.234375,0.115234375

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C.

However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of decreasing ambient temperature on the gas turbine's thermal efficiency?,A3,There's a positive effect on thermal efficiency with dropping ambient temperatures.,2.015625,2.296875,3.390625,1.2578125,0.2080078125

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of decreasing ambient temperature on the gas turbine's thermal efficiency?,A5,"As ambient temperature falls, the gas turbine's thermal efficiency rises.",1.9921875,2.265625,3.390625,1.25,0.193359375

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What limits the power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures?,A2,"At high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) restricts the power output.",1.609375,1.984375,3.25,1.1171875,0.11572265625

As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13.

The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What limits the power output from the gas turbine at high ambient temperatures?,A5,The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is the primary constraint on power output in high ambient conditions.,1.859375,1.96875,3.484375,1.2109375,0.1064453125

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What trends are observed in the air–fuel ratio during the ambient temperature transient?,A2,"First drops, then rises as the control mechanism shifts from EGT to speed parameters.",1.6953125,1.8125,3.46875,1.0859375,0.2734375

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed.

Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4. The increase in compressor pressure ratio will contribute only to an increase in power output provided design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12.

The power output of the gas turbine can be represented as the product of the airflow and the specific work as discussed in Chapter 2. The specific work is given by Equation 2.20. The increase in cycle temperature ratio always increases the specific work, whereas a change of the pressure ratio will increase only the specific work, provided that the compressor pressure ratio is below that which gives the maximum specific work. It should be noted that the specific work is proportional to the ambient temperature, T₁; thus, for a given pressure ratio and temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, the specific work will actually decrease as T₁ decreases. In the engine simulator, the maximum compressor pressure ratio is slightly above the case where the specific work is a maximum. Thus, the increase in specific work is due primarily to the increased maximum cycle temperature ratio, resulting in increased power output as the ambient temperature decreases, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, however, increases the thermal efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2 and as shown in Fig. 11.12. The increase in air flow (discussed above) also increases the power output of the gas turbine but has no direct effect on the thermal efficiency. The decrease in ambient temperature generally results in a larger

increase in power output compared with the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine (during constant EGT operation).

Figure 11.12 also shows the trends in the gas power, which is effectively the power output of the gas generator and is calculated assuming that the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine is 100%. The gas thermal efficiency is also shown in Fig. 11.12 and is the thermal efficiency of the gas generator, which is calculated using the gas power output rather than the shaft power. Consequently, the gas power output and gas thermal efficiency will be higher than the gas turbine (shaft) power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The use of gas power and gas thermal efficiency is primarily to compare the performance of different gas generators and is included here only for completeness.

As the ambient temperature decreases below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance becomes constrained by the gas generator speed. In the period of operation at constant gas generator speed, the power output increases very slightly. During this period of operation, the rate of increase of the maximum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, decreases due to near choked conditions at the compressor inlet. However, this temperature ratio and the compressor airflow have indeed increased, due to the increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. The increase in these parameters will result in an increase in power output. But the impact of the lower ambient temperature reduces the specific work during the period of constant gas generator speed operation and this is shown in Fig. 11.13. Thus the net effect is only a modest or small increase in power output, as shown in Fig. 11.14, which represents the power and thermal efficiency trends shown in Fig. ",What trends are observed in the air–fuel ratio during the ambient temperature transient?,A4,"Ratio falls then climbs, reflecting shifts in engine performance control strategies.",1.484375,1.5234375,3.28125,1.0703125,0.1396484375

Also, the effects of the gas property terms R, cₚ and γ will be ignored, as the changes in these parameters are small compared with the changes in temperatures and pressures.

During the simulation it will be observed that the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at high ambient.

temperatures (from 30 degrees C to about 12 degrees C) to prevent the turbine from overheating. As the ambient temperature decreases and operation is continued at the EGT limit, then the ratio of EGT to the ambient temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, will increase. From Fig. 11.6, an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁ must therefore result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed, √T. However, the gas generator speed, N₁/1, initially decreases with decrease in ambient temperature, T₁ before increasing at lower ambient temperature while power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. This condition is shown in Fig. 11.8. The initial decrease in gas generator speed is due primarily to the opening of VIGV/VSV as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in gas generator speed is due to the choking of the compressor inlet.

When the power output from the engine is limited by the gas generator speed (i.e. when N₁ is constant), as would occur at lower ambient temperatures, from about 12 degrees C to –12 degrees C, the drop in ambient temperature, T₁, will result in an increase in the N₁/√T₁. Thus as the ambient temperature decreases, the operating point on these characteristics (Figs 11.3 to 11.7) moves from left to right and becomes constrained to operate at the maximum permissible compressor non-dimensional speed, which occurs at ambient temperatures below –12 degrees C. At such low ambient temperatures, the power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

in the ambient temperature is observed until the gas generator speed reaches its 100% value of 9500 RPM (during constant EGT operation). The figure also shows the increase in non-dimensional speed of the compressor with a reduction in ambient temperature. The non-dimensional speed continues to increase even during the operating period, where the power output is restricted by the gas generator speed, N₁. At lower ambient temperature (below –12 degrees Celsius), the compressor non-dimensional speed reaches its operating limit as shown in Fig. 11.8. Note the continuous reduction in gas generator speed as the ambient temperature decreases during the period when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

# 11.3.2 Compressor characteristic

Figure 11.9 shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic. As the ambient temperature decreases, the operation point moves up the characteristic closely following the running line. At an ambient temperature below –12 degrees Celsius, the operating point remains at the maximum non-dimensional speed line as the engine is now constrained to operate at the maximum, N₁/√T₁. The compressor pressure ratio is also approximately constant under these operating conditions. Thus the compressor pressure ratio and the non-dimensional mass flow increase with the decrease in ambient temperature, reaching a maximum when the engine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The figure also shows the region where the compressor inlet starts to choke, resulting in the compressor non-

# 11.3.3 Trends in pressure ratio

The trends in the pressure ratios for the engine components are shown in Fig. 11.10 during the ambient temperature change. The Figure also shows the ratio of T₃/T₁, which is the ratio of the maximum cycle temperature (TET), to the compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Note that, as the compressor pressure ratio increases, the ratio of T₃/T₁ also increases. Also observe that the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant, although the power turbine pressures ratio increases as the ambient temperature decreases. This is due to the choked conditions of the power turbine restricting the gas generator turbine pressure ratio from changing. This was discussed in Section 8.1.2 where the matching of turbines operating in series was considered and it was established that the power turbine swallowing capacity controls the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. The Figure also shows the pressure ratios remaining constant when the engine is constrained to operate at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.11 Variation of compressor airflow rate, fuel flow rate, air–fuel ratio and fuel valve position during ambient temperature transient.

It has been established that the compressor non-dimensional speed increases as the ambient temperature falls for the ambient temperature transient case we are considering. From Fig. 11.3, it was observed that the compressor non-dimensional flow increases continuously with non-dimensional speed. Thus, the compressor airflow rate increases continuously with the reduction in ambient temperature because in general, as W₁√T₁/P₁ increases and as T₁ falls, W₁ must increase to compensate the reduction in √T₁. The rate of increase of airflow rate is the greatest when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. During this period of operation, the compressor is farthest away from compressor inlet choking, as the lines of constant non-dimensional speed on the compressor characteristic are more spaced out, particularly at high ambient temperatures.

At low ambient temperatures, when the compressor operates under near-choked conditions, a flatter line describes the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.3). Thus, the rate of increase of compressor airflow rate decreases when the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed controls the engine performance, which occurs at low ambient temperatures.

It is observed that the fuel flow rate increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, and decreases when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed or the compressor non-dimensional speed. As the ambient temperature decreases, the power output and the thermal efficiency increase, particularly in the period when the power output from the gas turbine power output is controlled by EGT. This is due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio and mass flow rate as discussed above.

# 302 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency and is discussed in the next section. Hence, the fuel flow increases during the period when the EGT limits the gas turbine power output, as shown in Fig. 11.11.

At lower ambient temperature operation (+12 to –12 degrees Celsius), the power output of the gas turbine is controlled by the gas generator speed. The power output from the gas turbine during this period of operation remains essentially constant (see Fig. 11.12). However, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine continues to increase due to the increase in pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Thus the increase in thermal efficiency and approximately constant power output from the gas turbine results in a decrease in the thermal input and hence fuel flow (Fig. 11.11).

At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine power output is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed and therefore the engine operates at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed. From Fig. 11.7, which shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power, a constant compressor non-dimensional speed implies a constant gas turbine non-dimensional fuel flow, Mf/P₁√T₁, and power output, Pow/P₁√T₁. Thus, a decrease in the ambient temperature, T₁, will result in a decrease in the fuel flow, Mf, in order to maintain the constant non-dimensional fuel flow. Hence, a decrease is observed in the fuel flow with the decrease in ambient temperature when the gas turbine is operating at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed.

It is observed that the air–fuel ratio decreases initially during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature.

and then increases during the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, there is an increase in both compressor airflow and fuel flow (the increase in airflow must also increase the combustion airflow). The rate of increase in fuel flow is greater than the increase in combustion airflow thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio and is due to an increase in the combustion temperature rise, as shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed, the fuel flow rate decreases while the airflow rate increases. Thus, the air–fuel ratio increases during this period of operation.

# 11.3.5 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Figure 11.12 shows the trends in power and thermal efficiency as the ambient temperature decreases from +30 degrees Celsius to –30 degrees Celsius. In the period when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature, the power output of the gas turbine and the thermal efficiency increase. The increase in power output results because of the increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁ (Fig. 11.10) and the increase in compressor airflow as discussed in Section 11.3.4.
