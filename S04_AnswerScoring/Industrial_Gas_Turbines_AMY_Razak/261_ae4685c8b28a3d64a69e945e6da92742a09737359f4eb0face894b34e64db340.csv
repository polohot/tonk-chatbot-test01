# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁.

# 16.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

In Chapter 2, it was stated that it is the specific humidity that affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly on NO. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. The variation in γ is also observed to be small compared with cₚ and R. These issues were discussed and illustrated for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine in Chapter 11, Section 11.5. The impact of humidity on the performance and emissions of a single-shaft gas turbine are now considered.

At any given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity increases the specific humidity. This results in an increase in the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, for air, while decreasing its isentropic index, γ. As stated in Section 11.5, the increase in R and cₚ is greater than γ. For Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2, which describes the specific work of an ideal gas turbine cycle, it is seen that the specific work is directly proportional to the specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ. For a given compressor ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, any increase in humidity will increase the specific work of the gas turbine cycle. This is due to the corresponding increase in cₚ. However, the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

compressor non-dimensional speed, γ the increase in N₁/√(1R1T1) decreases due to the increase R (note the compressor speed is constant for the single-shaft gas turbine. Also, only the effect of humidity is being considered and thus a constant ambient pressure P₁ and temperature T₁ are assumed).

The increase in humidity will therefore result in the compressor operating at a lower speed on the compressor characteristic. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed will also decrease the compressor non-dimensional flow W1 R T1 /γ. The decrease in compressor non-dimensional flow and the increase in the gas constant, R₁, due to the increase in humidity, will result in a decrease in the airflow rate through the compressor. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

As discussed earlier in the chapter, the decrease in the compressor non-dimensional flow will also decrease the maximum to minimum temperature cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁. Although the increase in cₚ due to the increase in humidity increases the specific work, the decrease in T₃/T₁ will decrease the specific work. The decrease in airflow rate through the compressor will also reduce the power output from the gas turbine. The net effect of these changes is a small decrease in power output due to the increase in humidity.

This is illustrated in Fig. 16.38, which shows the variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for relative humidity zero and 100%. The effect of humidity on the thermal efficiency of a single shaft gas turbine is illustrated in Figure 16.39. The decreases in the parameters that decrease the power output also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency. The decrease in compressor pressure due to the decrease in compressor non-dimensional speed, and the heat addition due to the increased water content of the air, also contribute to a lower thermal efficiency.

16.40 Effect of relative humidity on gas turbine emissions.

At high ambient temperatures, when the EGT limits the power output of the gas turbine, the effect of humidity on gas turbine power output differs from the two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine, which shows a worthwhile increase in power output from the gas turbine with humidity, particularly at high ambient temperatures. However, the impact of thermal efficiency is similar.

The impact of humidity on NOx emissions is more profound. High specific humidity results in increased presence of water vapour in the combustor, thus suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. This decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in NOx with the increase in humidity, as illustrated in Fig. 16.40.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure on engine performance

The impact of the change in ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Chapter 16, where the negative impact of high ambient temperatures on performance was observed. Another factor that affects engine performance is the ambient pressure. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to investigate the effects of the change in ambient pressure on engine performance. The ambient pressure may change quite significantly at a given elevation.
