The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

# 16.4.3 Trends in temperature ratio and pressure ratio

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",How do the temperature and pressure ratios change when the VIGV closes during the power-limited period?,A1,"The compressor and turbine pressure ratios decrease, and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases.",1.9140625,1.9375,3.3125,1.40625,0.34765625

# 16.31 Trends in power output and thermal efficiency.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",How do the temperature and pressure ratios change when the VIGV closes during the power-limited period?,A5,"During the power-limited period, closing the VIGV results in reduced pressure ratios and an increased temperature ratio.",1.90625,1.96875,3.34375,1.40625,0.498046875

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",How does the VIGV position change during the ambient transient?,A5,The ambient transient sees the VIGV moving from a fully open position to one that is almost closed.,1.953125,2.265625,3.484375,1.09375,0.4140625

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6.

Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

# 16.4.3 Trends in temperature ratio and pressure ratio

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point.

A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",Under what condition does the gas turbine's performance differ due to the VIGV's position?,A4,"When power limited, the gas turbine's performance changes as the VIGV closes to sustain the EGT at its designated level.",2.4375,2.59375,3.578125,1.578125,0.478515625

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",What changes are observed in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during the ambient transient?,A4,"The compressor non-dimensional speed goes up, but the turbine non-dimensional speed does not change significantly during the transient.",1.7265625,1.9140625,3.328125,1.5,0.326171875

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

# 16.4.3 Trends in temperature ratio and pressure ratio

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",What happens to the EGT during the transient as shown in Fig. 16.28?,A4,"No variation in EGT is observed during the transient, according to Fig. 16.28.",2.609375,2.671875,3.8125,1.0703125,0.5

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",What happens to the compressor and turbine powers when the engine power limit is reached?,A3,A reduction in compressor and turbine powers is observed to sustain the gas turbine's power output at its maximum limit.,1.96875,1.984375,3.421875,1.2890625,0.412109375

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of the VIGV closing on the compressor isentropic efficiency?,A3,A decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency is observed with the closure of the VIGV.,2.3125,2.5,3.5,1.34375,0.265625

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6.

It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

16.29 Trends in non-dimensional speed and VIGV position during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.4.3 Trends in temperature ratio and pressure ratio

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point. This results in the change of the compressor characteristic as shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of the VIGV closing on the turbine blade metal temperature?,A3,Closing the VIGV results in a lesser reduction in turbine blade metal temperature than keeping it open.,0.65625,0.5859375,3.0625,0.9375,0.2490234375

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

The closure of the VIGV also results in an increase in the combustion temperature, whereas the combustion temperature falls when the VIGV is fully opened, as is shown in Fig. 16.8. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. The compressor discharge temperature decreases for the reason given in Section 16.2.2. Due to a higher turbine entry temperature, T₃, as the VIGV closes, there is a smaller decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature compared with the case when the VIGV remains opened (Fig. 16.8).

# 16.4.2 Trends in speed and VIGV position

The effect of the closure of the VIGV during the period when the gas turbine performance is power limited can be seen in Fig. 16.29. The VIGV closes from 100% to about 15% at the end of the ambient transient. The figure also shows the change in the compressor and turbine non-dimensional speed during this transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed is similar to that discussed in Section 16.2.6. The turbine non-dimensional speed remains essentially constant because the turbine entry temperature remains virtually constant during this transient.

# 16.4.3 Trends in temperature ratio and pressure ratio

When the VIGV closes, the trends in temperature and pressure ratios differ from the case described in Section 16.2.1. It is observed that the compressor and thus the turbine pressure ratio decrease during the period when the engine is power limited, resulting from the closure of the VIGV, as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is also observed that the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases due to the turbine temperature, T₃, remaining constant while the ambient temperature and thus the compressor inlet temperature decreases.

The decrease in pressure ratio is necessary to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine as discussed in Section 16.3.1, where a similar response was observed from the engine when the VIGV closes at low ambient temperatures and low power outputs to maintain the EGT on its set point for VIGV control.

# 16.4.4 Trends in power, efficiency and compressor characteristic

The trend in power output from the gas turbine is the same as discussed in Section 16.2.1. The trend in the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is, however, different during the period when the engine reaches the power limit. This can be seen in Figure 16.31, where the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant during this period. It is observed in Figure 16.30 that the compressor pressure ratio decreases while the maximum to minimum cycle.

Temperature, T₃/T₁, increases when the power output limits the engine performance. There is also a decrease in the compressor isentropic efficiency as the VIGV closes and this is explained in Section 16.3.3. The net effect of these factors results in virtually no change in thermal efficiency during this period of engine operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Figure 16.32 shows the trends in the compressor and turbine powers and isentropic efficiencies. Again, it is the period when the engine power limit is reached that is of interest. The compressor power is observed decreasing as the VIGV closes and this is largely due to a reduction in mass flow rate through the compressor. A reduction in turbine power output also results, in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine at its limiting value of 45 MW. The compressor efficiency is observed to reduce and this is associated with the closing of the VIGV as explained in Section 16.3.3. The trend in turbine isentropic efficiency is similar to the case described in Section 16.2.1, where the turbine efficiency remains essentially constant. This is due to approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed (Fig. 16.29).

The performance of the gas turbine when the engine power output is limited by the EGT is not different to that discussed in Section 16.2.1. Thus the movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic is the same as that shown in Fig. 16.1 when the VIGV remains fully opened. It is only when the gas turbine becomes power limited that the difference in compressor performance is seen, which is due to the closure of the VIGV in order to maintain the exhaust gas temperature on its set point.
