# 11.14 Variation of power output and thermal efficiency with ambient temperature.

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",How does ambient temperature affect compressor airflow and specific work?,A1,"Ambient temperature affects compressor airflow and specific work, with decreases in temperature leading to changes in these parameters as shown in the figures.",0.76171875,0.83203125,3.09375,1.2734375,0.28125

# 11.14 Variation of power output and thermal efficiency with ambient temperature.

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",How does the compressor pressure ratio affect the power output of a gas turbine as ambient temperature decreases?,A5,"The effect of decreasing ambient temperature on power output is more pronounced in gas turbines operating at lower compressor pressure ratios, due to the resultant increases in temperature ratios and airflow.",2.46875,2.53125,3.578125,1.8046875,0.62109375

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

# 11.14 Variation of power output and thermal efficiency with ambient temperature.

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",What happens to the specific work as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 degrees Celsius?,A4,A more pronounced reduction in specific work occurs as ambient temperature drops below –15 degrees Celsius.,2.046875,2.265625,3.4375,1.1484375,0.3359375

This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁.

The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10.

# 11.14 Variation of power output and thermal efficiency with ambient temperature.

When gas turbines are designed to operate at lower compressor pressure ratios, the compressor inlet choking is less severe. This will result in a larger increase in power output during constant gas generator speed operation, due to the larger increase in maximum to minimum temperature ratios and airflow rate as the ambient temperature decreases, particularly if the design compressor pressure ratio is below the maximum cycle specific work condition. In this case the resultant increase in pressure ratio will also contribute to an increase in gas turbine power output.

Figure 11.12 shows that, at lower ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine performance is constrained by the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁. The operating point on the compressor characteristic will now correspond to the –30 degrees Celsius case, as shown in Fig. 11.9. The compressor will continue to operate at this point, restricting the increase in compressor ratio and thus the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, as shown in Figure 11.10. Therefore, as the ambient temperature decreases below –15 Celsius, the decrease in specific work will be more acute, as shown in Fig. ",Why is the increase in power output more significant at lower compressor pressure ratios when ambient temperature decreases?,A3,Lower compressor pressure ratios amplify the power output increase from ambient temperature decreases by boosting temperature ratios and airflow more substantially.,1.4453125,1.453125,3.125,1.4453125,0.283203125
