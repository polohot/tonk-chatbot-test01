The isentropic efficiency considers only the start and end states of the compression and expansion processes and pays no attention to the actual paths the compression and expansion processes take. Since the work is not a thermodynamic property and depends on the actual path, the polytropic analysis endeavours to account for the path taken during the compression and expansion processes in determining the actual work.

The Figure also shows the amount of energy that has been degraded during compression and has to be supplied in addition to the theoretical amount of work needed to increase the pressure from P1 to P2. This additional work corresponds to cp(T2 – T2′). Similarly, the energy unavailable during the expansion due to energy degradation is given by cp(T3 – T3′). The resultant increases in entropy during the actual compression and expansion processes are also shown in Fig. 2.10.

The efficiency of the compression process may be defined as the ratio of the ideal compression work to the actual compression work. For an expansion process, the efficiency is the ratio of the actual expansion work to the ideal expansion work. The efficiency will be less than unity because of the presence of irreversibilities.

# 2.8.2 Isentropic efficiency

The definition for efficiency given in Section 2.8.1 is indeed the isentropic efficiency and, referring to Fig. 2.10, the compressor efficiency is therefore given by:

ηc = cp (T2′ – T1) / (cp (T2 – T1)) [2.28]

For an isentropic process T2′ = cp T1 where c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ/(γ–1). Therefore

ηc = (T2 – T1) / (T2 – T1) [2.29]

Similarly, the isentropic efficiency for an expansion process is given by:

ηc = cp (T2 – T3) / (cp (T2 – T3′)) [2.30]

For an isentropic process,
