The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case.

The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case. Thus the power demand from the gas turbine may be achieved as the VIGV remains fully opened for a sufficiently long period of time so that the EGT remains below its limiting value. Hence the fuel flow control system sees a sufficient error, thus allowing the power demand to be met. This is shown in Fig. ",How does the mass flow rate through the compressor affect the gas turbine's power output?,A2,"The power output is directly influenced by the compressor's mass flow rate, which can be adjusted via the VIGV opening.",2.0,2.3125,3.34375,1.6328125,0.404296875

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case. Thus the power demand from the gas turbine may be achieved as the VIGV remains fully opened for a sufficiently long period of time so that the EGT remains below its limiting value. Hence the fuel flow control system sees a sufficient error, thus allowing the power demand to be met. This is shown in Fig. ",What are the consequences of the EGT reaching its limit value on gas turbine operation?,A5,"Exceeding EGT limits risks damaging the turbine, thus mechanisms like VIGV control are employed to maintain temperatures within safe bounds.",2.25,2.375,3.515625,1.5,0.51171875

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case. Thus the power demand from the gas turbine may be achieved as the VIGV remains fully opened for a sufficiently long period of time so that the EGT remains below its limiting value. Hence the fuel flow control system sees a sufficient error, thus allowing the power demand to be met. This is shown in Fig. ",What happens to the EGT when the VIGV is fully opened under open loop response?,A1,"The EGT increases but does not reach its limit value, allowing the power demand to be met as the VIGV remains fully opened.",1.8671875,1.828125,3.46875,1.359375,0.5234375

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case. Thus the power demand from the gas turbine may be achieved as the VIGV remains fully opened for a sufficiently long period of time so that the EGT remains below its limiting value. Hence the fuel flow control system sees a sufficient error, thus allowing the power demand to be met. This is shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of insufficient opening of the VIGV on the gas turbine power output?,A3,Severe loss in gas turbine power output occurs because the VIGV does not open enough to increase mass flow rate through the compressor.,2.625,2.671875,3.484375,1.46875,0.609375

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

20.12 VIGV opening during open and closed loop response from VIGV control system.

Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case. Thus the power demand from the gas turbine may be achieved as the VIGV remains fully opened for a sufficiently long period of time so that the EGT remains below its limiting value. Hence the fuel flow control system sees a sufficient error, thus allowing the power demand to be met. This is shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of fully opening the VIGV for a short period on the gas turbine's operation?,A4,"The strategy of momentarily fully opening the VIGV cuts EGT, paving the way for enhanced power output to desired or maximum levels.",1.703125,1.8046875,3.34375,1.421875,0.515625

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

# 20.2.1 Open and closed loop control system

It is clear that insufficient opening of the VIGV is the main cause of severe loss in the gas turbine power output, although the engine is on the EGT limit. The VIGV opening must be increased so that the mass flow rate through the compressor and thus the engine can increase. However, this would result in the engine behaving as discussed in Section 20.1, where the control system performance was considered when the VIGV is fully opened during the normal operating power range, when no problems in the VIGV action were experienced. This feature is exploited when the VIGV is opened, to say full, for a short period of time, thus decreasing the EGT. This allows the engine power to increase to the required set point or maximum engine operating power. When the VIGV action is implemented in this manner, it is referred to as an open loop control system, as there is no feedback mechanism to correct any errors after this period. Any error left by the open loop system can be rectified by switching to the closed loop control system.

The open and closed loop control systems are illustrated by repeating the earlier simulation but by activating the open loop response when the set point for the power output from the generator is increased. The VIGV is opened fully and linearly over a period of 2 seconds, which is its opening or stroke time. The VIGV is left fully opened for a period 15 seconds. On this occasion, the power demand is increased from 1 to 35 MW, as this will illustrate the opened and closed loop action more clearly. Increasing the power demand from the gas turbine results in the VIGV initially opening fully under open loop response, as shown in Fig. 20.12.

the EGT increases, as shown in Fig. 20.13, but it does not reach the limit value as observed in the previous case. Thus the power demand from the gas turbine may be achieved as the VIGV remains fully opened for a sufficiently long period of time so that the EGT remains below its limiting value. Hence the fuel flow control system sees a sufficient error, thus allowing the power demand to be met. This is shown in Fig. ",Why is it necessary to switch from open loop to closed loop control after fully opening the VIGV?,A1,"Switching to closed loop is essential to correct any errors left by the open loop system, ensuring precise and stable operation.",2.046875,2.21875,3.46875,1.34375,0.474609375

The change in the compressor characteristic is small due to this small opening of the VIGV (Fig. 20.10), resulting in little or no change in air-flow through the compressor, as shown in Fig. 20.11. It may be possible to reduce the response of the gas turbine by reducing the gain of the fuel control system or by increasing the gain of the VIGV control system, but this improves the situation only marginally and would result in an oscillatory response of the gas turbine and increase the likelihood of trips.
