3.30 Temperature–entropy diagram for the intercooled, reheat and regenerative (ICRHR) cycle.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31. Clearly, the Figure shows that the ICRHR cycle achieves the greatest thermal efficiency for pressure ratios greater than unity.

When irreversibilities in the thermodynamic processes occur in the ICRHR cycle, there is a decrease in the thermal efficiency and specific work from the ideal case. In spite of the high pressure losses in the heating and cooling processes, thermal efficiencies approaching 60% are possible with such complexes as shown in Fig. 3.32.

3.30 Temperature–entropy diagram for the intercooled, reheat and regenerative (ICRHR) cycle.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

Therefore:

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31. Clearly, the Figure shows that the ICRHR cycle achieves the greatest thermal efficiency for pressure ratios greater than unity.

3.30 Temperature–entropy diagram for the intercooled, reheat and regenerative (ICRHR) cycle.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31.

3.30 Temperature–entropy diagram for the intercooled, reheat and regenerative (ICRHR) cycle.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31. Clearly, the Figure shows that the ICRHR cycle achieves the greatest thermal efficiency for pressure ratios greater than unity.

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

3.30 Temperature–entropy diagram for the intercooled, reheat and regenerative (ICRHR) cycle.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31. Clearly, the Figure shows that the ICRHR cycle achieves the greatest thermal efficiency for pressure ratios greater than unity.

3.30 Temperature–entropy diagram for the intercooled, reheat and regenerative (ICRHR) cycle.

Identical conventional regenerative cycles 1–2–8–9 and 3–4–6–7, as shown in Fig. 2.8 in Chapter 2 and therefore the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle equals that of each cycle. Hence the thermal efficiency of the ICRHR cycle is given by:

ηₜₕ = 1 – T¹c [3.20]

where T₆ is the maximum cycle temperature and

c = ⌈ P⁴ ⌉γγ–1.

Since c ≤ c for c ≥ 1, the ICRHR cycle has a greater thermal efficiency than the conventional regenerative cycle and equals the conventional regenerative cycle when c = 1, which corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. It may also be concluded that the ideal thermal efficiency of the ICRHR is greater than that of the intercooled regenerative cycle and is therefore better than that of the reheated regenerative cycle by considering the inequality:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

for c ≥ 1

Therefore:

c   c2 ≥  c                                               [3.21]

Multiplying inequality 3.21 by –   T1 c and adding 1 gives:

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1   c

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c c                              [3.22]

1 –  T1 c2 1     T1

– T6     c + 1 ≤     T6   c                                [3.23]

The left-hand side of the inequality 3.23 is the ideal thermal efficiency of the intercooled–regenerative cycle and the right-hand side of the inequality is the thermal efficiency of ICRHR cycle. Thus the ICRHR has the highest thermal efficiency of all the gas turbine regenerative cycles discussed so far.

The variation of the ideal thermal efficiencies with overall compressor pressure ratios for the different regenerative cycles for a maximum cycle temperature of 1200K is summarised in Fig. 3.31. Clearly, the Figure shows that the ICRHR cycle achieves the greatest thermal efficiency for pressure ratios greater than unity.

When irreversibilities in the thermodynamic processes occur in the ICRHR cycle, there is a decrease in the thermal efficiency and specific work from the ideal case.
