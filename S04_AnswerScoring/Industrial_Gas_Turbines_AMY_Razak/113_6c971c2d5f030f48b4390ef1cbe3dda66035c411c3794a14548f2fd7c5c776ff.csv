At high compressor pressure ratios, gas turbines may employ more than one spool in the gas generator to overcome the compressor instabilities, as discussed in Section 4.10.2. A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine to drive the load is shown in Fig. 7.6. There is no mechanical coupling between the LP and the HP spool but there exists a strong fluid or aerodynamic coupling between these spools.

# 7.5 Off-design performance prediction of a three-shaft gas turbine with a free power turbine

At high compressor pressure ratios, gas turbines may employ more than one spool in the gas generator to overcome the compressor instabilities, as discussed in Section 4.10.2. A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine to drive the load is shown in Fig. 7.6. There is no mechanical coupling between the LP and the HP spool but there exists a strong fluid or aerodynamic coupling between these spools. The vector data needed for the prediction of the off-design performance of a three-shaft engine operating with a power turbine are as follows.

# 7.5 Off-design performance prediction of a three-shaft gas turbine with a free power turbine

At high compressor pressure ratios, gas turbines may employ more than one spool in the gas generator to overcome the compressor instabilities, as discussed in Section 4.10.2. A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine to drive the load is shown in Fig. 7.6. There is no mechanical coupling between the LP and the HP spool but there exists a strong fluid or aerodynamic coupling between these spools. The vector data needed for the prediction of the off-design performance of a three-shaft engine operating with a power turbine are as follows.

1. compressor inlet flow, W1
2. compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1
3. turbine entry temperature, T3.

Using these estimates, every engine parameter can be calculated (pressures, temperatures, speeds, flows and powers for each engine component). The calculated powers, flows and speeds may not necessarily satisfy the flow, power and speed compatibility but these errors or differences can be used to determine the check vectors F employed by Equation 7.25. This is achieved by considering:

|Turbine Flow Compatibility|Turbine Flow Compatibility|
|---|
|W3|R T3 / γ|
|P3| |

(1) turbine flow compatibility

(2) power compatibility (i.e. difference between gas turbine calculated power and required power)

(3) speed compatibility (i.e. difference between gas turbine speed and speed required by the load).

It is important that the number of estimates is at least equal to the number of checks. For the single shaft gas turbine, three estimates and checks have been described. A required fuel flow or compressor pressure ratio can be specified instead of a required power output in which case the power output will be calculated. The solution will result in the evaluation of all relevant thermodynamic parameters (e.g. pressures, temperature and flows).

For a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine the vector data are as follows.

The estimated vectors are:

1. compressor inlet flow, W1
2. compressor pressure ratio, P2/P1
3. turbine entry temperature, T3
4. gas generator pressure ratio, P3/P4

# Off-design performance prediction

And the check vectors are:

|⌈ W₃|R T /γ|
|---|---|
|(1) gas generator flow compatibility|⌊ 3 3 3 ⌋|
|⎜ P₃|⎝|

(2) power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine

W₁ × cpa × (T₂ – T₁) and W₃ × cpg × (T₃ – T₄), respectively

|W5|R T /γ|
|---|---|
|(3) power turbine flow compatibility|5 5 5|
|P5| |

(4) the difference between the power output from the power turbine and the required power output.

There are four estimates and checks for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine. Fuel flow, gas generator speed, compressor non-dimensional speed or compressor pressure ratio can be specified as check vectors instead of the required power output.

The matrix method effectively applies Newton’s method (also known as the Newton-Raphson method) to solve a set of non-linear simultaneous equations. Teukolsky et al.³ and Gerald and Wheatly 4 give further details.

# 7.5 Off-design performance prediction of a three-shaft gas turbine with a free power turbine

At high compressor pressure ratios, gas turbines may employ more than one spool in the gas generator to overcome the compressor instabilities, as discussed in Section 4.10.2. A schematic representation of a three-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine to drive the load is shown in Fig. 7.6. There is no mechanical coupling between the LP and the HP spool but there exists a strong fluid or aerodynamic coupling between these spools. The vector data needed for the prediction of the off-design performance of a three-shaft engine operating with a power turbine are as follows.
