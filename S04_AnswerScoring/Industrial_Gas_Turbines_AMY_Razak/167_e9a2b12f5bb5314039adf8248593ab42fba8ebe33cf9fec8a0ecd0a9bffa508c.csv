power output range of the gas turbine. Another strategy for controlling the VIGV is to maintain the EGT at the maximum or limiting value for reduced power outputs. If the above control strategy is attempted, an increase in power demand from the gas turbine will result in the EGT limit being reached before the VIGV is fully open. Thus the maximum power output from the gas turbine cannot be achieved. An open loop response may be incorporated into the control system of the VIGV to rectify this problem. The open loop response may be such that the VIGV is opened fully for a fixed time period when an increase in power demand is required. Provided this time period is sufficiently large, the desired power output from the gas turbine can be achieved. After the elapse of this time period, the control switches to close loop control so that the VIGV closes to maintain the EGT on its limit.

10.10 Control system strategy for VIGV control applied to a single-shaft gas turbine (EGT = exhaust gas temperature).

# Engine control systems and transient performance

power output range of the gas turbine. Another strategy for controlling the VIGV is to maintain the EGT at the maximum or limiting value for reduced power outputs. If the above control strategy is attempted, an increase in power demand from the gas turbine will result in the EGT limit being reached before the VIGV is fully open. Thus the maximum power output from the gas turbine cannot be achieved. An open loop response may be incorporated into the control system of the VIGV to rectify this problem. The open loop response may be such that the VIGV is opened fully for a fixed time period when an increase in power demand is required. Provided this time period is sufficiently large, the desired power output from the gas turbine can be achieved. After the elapse of this time period, the control switches to close loop control so that the VIGV closes to maintain the EGT on its limit.

Inclusion of the open loop response resolves the difficulty of maintaining the power demand from the gas turbine at constant EGT operation, when such a control system is used in DLE engines, in the period when the VIGV is fully opened (open loop) the fuel–air ratio may exceed the lower extinction limit. This results in flameout and tripping of the engine. A better control strategy, in this instance, is to modulate the VIGV to maintain the power demand and to modulate the fuel valve to maintain the EGT on the required limit.

power output range of the gas turbine. Another strategy for controlling the VIGV is to maintain the EGT at the maximum or limiting value for reduced power outputs. If the above control strategy is attempted, an increase in power demand from the gas turbine will result in the EGT limit being reached before the VIGV is fully open. Thus the maximum power output from the gas turbine cannot be achieved. An open loop response may be incorporated into the control system of the VIGV to rectify this problem. The open loop response may be such that the VIGV is opened fully for a fixed time period when an increase in power demand is required.

10.10 Control system strategy for VIGV control applied to a single-shaft gas turbine (EGT = exhaust gas temperature).

# Engine control systems and transient performance

power output range of the gas turbine. Another strategy for controlling the VIGV is to maintain the EGT at the maximum or limiting value for reduced power outputs. If the above control strategy is attempted, an increase in power demand from the gas turbine will result in the EGT limit being reached before the VIGV is fully open. Thus the maximum power output from the gas turbine cannot be achieved. An open loop response may be incorporated into the control system of the VIGV to rectify this problem. The open loop response may be such that the VIGV is opened fully for a fixed time period when an increase in power demand is required. Provided this time period is sufficiently large, the desired power output from the gas turbine can be achieved. After the elapse of this time period, the control switches to close loop control so that the VIGV closes to maintain the EGT on its limit.

Inclusion of the open loop response resolves the difficulty of maintaining the power demand from the gas turbine at constant EGT operation, when such a control system is used in DLE engines, in the period when the VIGV is fully opened (open loop) the fuel–air ratio may exceed the lower extinction limit. This results in flameout and tripping of the engine. A better control strategy, in this instance, is to modulate the VIGV to maintain the power demand and to modulate the fuel valve to maintain the EGT on the required limit. By employing such a control strategy, the open loop response described above can be eliminated.

Such a strategy for VIGV control is suitable when the EGT set point for VIGV control is below the maximum EGT limit. It is normally employed primarily to reduce gas turbine starting power requirements for single-shaft gas turbines. Since the EGT set point for operating the VIGV is below the maximum EGT limit, the VIGV will be fully opened for most of the useful.
