Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",How does the compressor isentropic efficiency change during the ambient temperature transient?,A1,"The compressor isentropic efficiency increases then decreases when the VIGV is fully opened, and decreases more rapidly when the VIGV closes.",1.75,1.9296875,3.5,1.4609375,0.40625

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",How does the compressor isentropic efficiency change during the ambient temperature transient?,A5,"During the transient, compressor efficiency undergoes an increase and decrease with VIGV open, then a rapid decrease with VIGV closing.",1.1484375,1.3359375,3.171875,1.453125,0.416015625

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",How does the compressor non-dimensional speed behave during the VIGV closing period?,A4,"The compressor non-dimensional speed rises during the VIGV closing phase, contrary to the decrease in inlet mass flow.",2.0,2.375,3.375,1.4296875,0.443359375

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",How does the fuel flow and fuel valve position change when the gas turbine power output remains constant?,A3,Fuel flow and the position of the fuel valve drop if the gas turbine's power output doesn't change.,1.2265625,1.2734375,3.234375,1.09375,0.484375

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",How does turbine power output adjust to maintain power compatibility during the transient?,A3,"Adjustments in turbine power output, increasing during VIGV open and decreasing during VIGV closed, ensure power compatibility.",1.5078125,1.4296875,3.140625,1.390625,0.28125

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What are the trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during an ambient temperature transient?,A2,"During an ambient temperature transient, power output stays steady, and thermal efficiency rises with the VIGV fully open before stabilizing as the VIGV closes.",0.40625,0.44140625,3.25,1.265625,0.392578125

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What causes the change in compressor power absorbed during the ambient temperature transient?,A1,"The increase in compressor power absorbed is due to the increase in mass flow rate when the VIGV is fully opened, and the decrease is due to the decrease in mass flow rate when the VIGV closes.",1.2734375,1.203125,3.21875,1.4765625,0.65625

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What causes the change in compressor power absorbed during the ambient temperature transient?,A5,Mass flow rate variations during VIGV operations dictate the increase and decrease in compressor power absorbed.,1.6328125,1.7890625,3.203125,1.4140625,0.240234375

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What effect does the increase in compressor pressure ratio have on thermal efficiency in a gas turbine?,A5,The net effect of increasing the compressor pressure ratio is a small rise in thermal efficiency.,2.3125,2.484375,3.578125,1.3515625,0.30078125

16.24 Trends in gas turbine power output and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What happens to the air–fuel ratio during the transient when the VIGV closes?,A4,The air–fuel ratio drops a bit when the VIGV is in the process of closing.,2.015625,2.140625,3.53125,1.1328125,0.3671875

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.

16.25 Trends in compressor and turbine efficiency and power.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What impact does the ambient temperature transient have on turbine creep life usage?,A3,"Decreased turbine blade temperature leads to minimal creep life usage, pushing the next overhaul further out.",1.0390625,0.8984375,3.28125,1.09375,0.31640625

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the change in compressor power absorbed results in a change in turbine power output to maintain the power compatibility. Thus, the turbine power output increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and decreases when the VIGV closes, as is shown in Fig. 16.25.

# 16.3.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The turbine blade metal temperature decreases during the transient (Fig. 16.17) and this reduction is due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, and compressor discharge temperature, T₂, which is also the cooling air temperature. Although the turbine power output increases and therefore the stress in the turbine increases due to the extra torque, the reduction in turbine blade metal temperature dominates, thus decreasing the turbine creep life usage. This is shown in Fig. 16.26 as an increase in the time to next engine overhaul, which increases to over 500,000 hours, which means that the usage of turbine creep life is minimal during this transient.

# 16.3.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The trends in gas turbine emissions during this transient are shown in Figure 16.27. Although there is an increase in compressor discharge pressure and hence the combustion pressure increases (Fig. 16.18) during the period when the VIGV is fully opened, there is also a reduction in combustion temperature (Fig. ",What trends are observed in gas turbine emissions during the ambient temperature transient?,A2,Emissions trends are influenced by higher combustion pressure but lower combustion temperature during the transient.,1.3984375,1.390625,3.171875,1.25,0.0673828125

Since the gas turbine power output remains constant, the increased thermal efficiency results in the fuel flow and the fuel valve position decreasing during this transient. The increase in airflow and the decrease in fuel flow result in an increase in the air–fuel ratio as shown in Fig. 16.23, which displays the trends in flow and fuel valve position for this transient.

In the period when the VIGV closes, the compressor inlet mass flow rate decreases, although the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase (Fig. 16.22). There is a decrease in compressor pressure ratio while the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, increases. Furthermore, the operating point on the compressor characteristic is in a region where the compressor efficiency is lower (Figure 16.21). The net effect of these changes is that the thermal efficiency remains essentially constant. Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during this transient, the fuel flow and fuel valve position also remain constant as seen in Fig. 16.23. Note that compressor airflow and thus combustion airflow decrease slightly while the fuel flow remains constant. Thus the air–fuel ratio decreases slightly during this transient.

# 16.3.6 Trends in power and efficiency

The gas turbine and generator power remain constant because no engine operating limits are exceeded during this transient. The gas turbine thermal efficiency increases during the period when the VIGV is fully opened and remains essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes. This is explained in Section 16.3.5 and these trends are shown in Fig. 16.24.

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies are shown in Fig. 16.25. There is a slight increase in turbine isentropic efficiency during the period when the VIGV remains fully open, and this effect is associated with the increased turbine non-dimensional speed as shown in Fig. 16.22. During the period when the VIGV closes, the turbine efficiency remains approximately constant and this is due largely to the approximately constant turbine non-dimensional speed during this period of operation.

The trend in the compressor isentropic efficiency shows an increase in the compressor efficiency followed by a decrease during the period when the VIGV is fully opened. As the ambient temperature decreases, the compressor operating point moves through regions on the compressor characteristic where the efficiency is high and then through regions (at low ambient temperatures) where the compressor efficiency is low. This is shown schematically in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is fully opened.

During the period of engine operation when the VIGV closes, the compressor efficiency decreases more rapidly and this is due to the compressor operating on the part of the compressor characteristic that is further away from surge as explained in Section 16.3.3. Thus the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is lower in this region and this is also shown in Fig. 16.21 for the case when the VIGV is closed.

The increase in compressor power absorbed (Fig. 16.25), during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened, is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the compressor as shown in Fig. 16.23. Conversely, the decrease in compressor power absorbed during the period when the VIGV closes is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor as can be seen in Fig. 16.23.
