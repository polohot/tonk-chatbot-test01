# 2.1 Representation of a heat engine.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system.

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system.

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

The immediate question that arises is ‘what is the maximum efficiency a heat engine can produce’? This is best answered by using the Carnot efficiency.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive.

Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system.

# 2.1 Representation of a heat engine.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive.

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system

The immediate question that arises is ‘what is the maximum efficiency a heat engine can produce’? This is best answered by using the Carnot efficiency.

# 2.1 Representation of a heat engine.

Carnot showed that the maximum thermal efficiency ‘ ηth,max’ a heat engine can develop is given by Equation 2.1.

ηth,max = 1 - T2 / T1  [2.1]

where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, respectively and the efficiency ηth,max is called the Carnot efficiency. Clearly, the Carnot efficiency will increase as the ratio T2/T1 decreases, as expressed in Equation 2.1. To satisfy the Carnot efficiency condition, all the heat supplied from the heat source must occur at a constant temperature, T1, and all the heat rejected to the heat sink must also occur at a constant temperature, T2.

# 2.3 Entropy

The availability and accessibility of energy is important in producing work from a heat engine. The more accessible the energy is, the lower is its entropy. Consequently, the less available the energy, the higher is its entropy.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property given the symbol S, and the change in entropy during a thermodynamic process is defined as:

ΔS = ∫ dQ / T  [2.2]

If it is assumed that the work done, W, by the heat engine is zero, then Q1 = Q2 = Q as would be required by the first law of thermodynamics. The decrease in entropy of the heat source is given by ΔSsource = -Q/T1 and the increase in entropy of the heat sink is ΔSsink = Q/T2, as convention states that the heat lost from a thermodynamic system is negative and the work done by a thermodynamic system is positive. The net change in the entropy of the system ΔSsystem is:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ΔSsystem = ΔSsource + ΔSsink [2.3]

ΔS = Q1 – Q2 = ⌈ 1     1 ⌉ [2.4]

system T1 T2 Q⎜ T2 – T1 ⎝

Since T1 must be higher than T2 for heat to flow from the heat source to the heat sink, from Equation 2.4 the change in the entropy of the system will be positive. Although the entropy of the heat source decreases, the increase in the entropy of the heat sink is greater than the decrease in the entropy of the heat source. Thus the entropy of a system cannot decrease, but will increase whenever possible, and this is another statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

What prevents the heat engine above from achieving 100% thermal efficiency is this increase in entropy or degradation of energy, thus preventing the heat rejected to the heat sink (Q2) from reaching zero. Therefore, some heat must be rejected from a heat engine (i.e. Q2 cannot be zero). This condition is effectively the statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Further information on entropy and the second law of thermodynamics may be found in Rogers and Mayhew1 and in Eastop and McConkey2.

# 2.4 Steady flow energy equation

Unlike a piston engine, where the compression and expansion processes are intermittent, the gas turbine cycle is a continuous flow process. Therefore, the governing equation that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics is the steady flow energy equation. The steady flow energy equation may be simply described as:

Q – W = ΔH [2.5]

where

- Q represents the heat input into a steady flow thermodynamic system
- W represents the work done by the thermodynamic system
- ΔH represents the change in the energy of the gas in the system.

ΔH has capacity to hold heat (specific heat) and is called the change in the stagnation or total enthalpy in the thermodynamic system.
