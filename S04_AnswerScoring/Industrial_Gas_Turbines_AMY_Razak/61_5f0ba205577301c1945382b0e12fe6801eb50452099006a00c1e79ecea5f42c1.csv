# 4.2 Compressor blading

The stage pressure ratio and efficiency is primarily dependent on blade profile. Figure 4.2 shows the blade profile of a compressor stage. The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂. The design assumes a constant axial velocity Cₐ and this can be allowed for

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂. The design assumes a constant axial velocity Cₐ and this can be allowed for

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂.

The stage pressure ratio and efficiency is primarily dependent on blade profile. Figure 4.2 shows the blade profile of a compressor stage. The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂.

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

The stage pressure ratio and efficiency is primarily dependent on blade profile. Figure 4.2 shows the blade profile of a compressor stage. The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂.

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

# 4.2 Compressor blading

The stage pressure ratio and efficiency is primarily dependent on blade profile. Figure 4.2 shows the blade profile of a compressor stage. The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂. The design assumes a constant axial velocity Cₐ and this can be allowed for

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

# 4.2 Compressor blading

The stage pressure ratio and efficiency is primarily dependent on blade profile. Figure 4.2 shows the blade profile of a compressor stage. The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂. The design assumes a constant axial velocity Cₐ and this can be allowed for

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

# 4.2 Compressor blading

The stage pressure ratio and efficiency is primarily dependent on blade profile. Figure 4.2 shows the blade profile of a compressor stage. The air enters the rotor and is deflected by the rotor through an angle suitable for the stator, which would prevent it from stalling. The air may diffuse as it passes through the rotor and stator depending on the reaction of the stage. Figure 4.2 also shows the velocity triangles at blade mid-height, where U is the rotor velocity. The air enters the rotor at a relative velocity of V₁. The absolute velocity is C₁ and the angles of V₁ and C₁ relative to the vertical are β₁ and α₁, respectively. The relative and absolute velocities of air leaving the rotor are V₂ and C₂ and their respective angles to the vertical are β₂ and α₂. The design assumes a constant axial velocity Cₐ and this can be allowed for

|V₁|β₁|α₁|C₁|Cₐ|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|U| | | | |
|V₂|β₂|α₂|C₂|Cₐ|

by adjusting the convergence of the annulus due to the increase in density as the pressure rises in the compressor.

All the work input into the compressor stage can be entered only via the rotor due to its rotation. Since there is no change in the axial velocity, all the work absorbed by the compressor stage is due to the change in the tangential or whirl velocity (Cw₁ and Cw₂) where Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁) and Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂).

For a unit mass flow rate through the stage, the change in whirl velocity is the rate of change in momentum. Newton tells us that the rate of change in momentum is the force acting on the rotor blade. Therefore, the power absorbed by the compressor stage is the force multiplied by the velocity, which in this case is the blade velocity, U. Therefore, the work done per unit mass flow rate, W, is given by:

W = UΔVw = U(Cw₂ – Cw₁) = U Ca(tan(α₂) – tan(α₁)) [4.1]

and the power absorbed will be:

Power = W × m where m is mass flow rate.

Equation 4.1 will be more useful if we represent the stage work using rotor air angles β₁ and β₂. When this is done, Equation 4.1 can be written as:

W = U Ca(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.2]

where β₂ – β₁ is the deflection of the air by the rotor.

Since the two velocity triangles in Fig. 4.2 have the same height Ca and base U, they can be superimposed to produce the combined velocity triangle and this is shown in Fig. 4.3.

Figure 4.3 also shows the rotor and stator deflection and the change in whirl or tangential velocity ΔVw. The diffusion in the rotor and stator results in velocity vector V₂ being less than the velocity vector V₁, and the velocity vector C₁ being less than the velocity vector C₂. The greater is the rotor and stator deflection, the greater the diffusion in the rotor and stator.

# 4.3 Combined velocity triangles for rotor and stator.

# Compressors

have constructed the velocity triangles such that the rotor and stator deflections are equal, therefore the amount of diffusion in the rotor and the stator is equal. Thus the reaction for this compressor stage is 50%.

It is evident from Equation 4.2 that the stage work absorbed will increase with the deflection, axial velocity and blade velocity. Increasing the stage work input will result in a smaller number of compressor stages to achieve a given overall pressure ratio.

# 4.2.1 Increased rotor deflection

Although increasing the deflection will increase the work input, an increase in deflection will also increase the amount of diffusion because it results in a reduction in velocity vector V₂. The change in the velocity triangles due to increased deflection is shown in Fig. 4.4 by the dotted lines.
