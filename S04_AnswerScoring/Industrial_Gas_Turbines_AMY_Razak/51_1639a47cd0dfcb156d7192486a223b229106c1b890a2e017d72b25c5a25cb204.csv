Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine.

But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

At high heat exchanger effectiveness, the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio for maximum thermal efficiency also approaches the case when optimised for maximum specific work. This is shown in Fig. 3.28, which shows the variation of optimum HP turbine pressure ratio with the overall pressure ratio.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

At high heat exchanger effectiveness, the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio for maximum thermal efficiency also approaches the case when optimised for maximum specific work. This is shown in Fig. 3.28, which shows the variation of optimum HP turbine pressure ratio with the overall pressure ratio.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

At high heat exchanger effectiveness, the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio for maximum thermal efficiency also approaches the case when optimised for maximum specific work. This is shown in Fig. 3.28, which shows the variation of optimum HP turbine pressure ratio with the overall pressure ratio.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

At high heat exchanger effectiveness, the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio for maximum thermal efficiency also approaches the case when optimised for maximum specific work. This is shown in Fig. 3.28, which shows the variation of optimum HP turbine pressure ratio with the overall pressure ratio.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

At high heat exchanger effectiveness, the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio for maximum thermal efficiency also approaches the case when optimised for maximum specific work. This is shown in Fig. 3.28, which shows the variation of optimum HP turbine pressure ratio with the overall pressure ratio.

# 3.3 Intercooled, reheat and regenerative cycles

The inclusion of intercoolers and reheaters will no doubt increase the specific work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. A combined intercooled and reheat cycle will give a very similar performance to that discussed in Section 3.1.3. But it is the addition of a heat exchanger to such a cycle that will further increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. The design point performance of gas turbine cycles that incorporate both intercooling, reheating and the addition of regeneration will now be discussed. A schematic representation of the ICRHR cycle is shown in Fig. 3.29.

# 3.3.1 Ideal ICRHR cycle

We have shown that the minimum compression specific work due to intercooling occurs when the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal. We have also shown that the maximum turbine specific work due to reheating occurs when the HP and LP turbine pressure ratios are equal and corresponds to the condition when the heat input is a maximum. Thus, from the argument in Section 3.2.5, the maximum ideal cycle thermal efficiency.

Qₙₑₜ = 2cₚ(T₄ – T₅)

and the compressor work, Wc is given by:

Wc = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

Hence, from Equation 3.13, the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated–regenerative cycle is:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₂ – T₁) / (2 (T₄ – T₅))                                          [3.14]

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T / (c – 1)) = 1 – (T¹ / (2c)) (c – 1)                   [3.15]

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since \( c \geq 1 \), it can be shown that \( \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{1}{2c} \). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the conventional regenerative cycle whose thermal efficiency is given in Chapter 2 by Equation 2.25. When \( c = 1 \), the thermal efficiencies of the conventional and reheat–regenerative cycles give the same thermal efficiency and this equals the Carnot efficiency.

The thermal efficiency of the reheat regenerative cycle can also be determined as less than the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. This can be proved by considering the inequality:

\( (c - 1)² \geq 0 \) for \( c \geq 1 \) [3.17]

Expanding:

\( c - 2c + 1 \geq 0 \)

Adding \( 4c \) gives:

\( c² + 2c + 1 \geq 4c \)

Factorising gives:

\( (c + 1)² \geq 4c \) [3.18]

Dividing by \( 2(c + 1) \) then multiplying by \( -T^1c \) and adding 1 we get:

\( 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_4}c(c + 1) \leq \frac{T_4}{2c} \) [3.19]

The left-hand side of inequality 3.19 is the thermal efficiency of the reheat–regenerative cycle while the right-hand side is the thermal efficiency of the intercooled regenerative cycle. \( T_4 \) is the maximum cycle temperature for both the intercooled and reheat regenerative cycles. Thus, the thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled regenerative cycle is greater than the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat–regenerative cycle.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the ideal reheated regenerative cycle with compressor pressure ratio is shown in Fig. 3.26. The figure also shows the variation of thermal efficiency of the simple cycle, conventional regeneration cycle and the reheat cycle for comparison. The variation of specific work with pressure ratio is the same as that shown in Fig. 3.19.

# 3.2.6 Practical reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle

Allowing for losses, the reheat regenerative cycle is quite capable of achieving respectable thermal efficiencies as is shown in Fig. 3.27. The optimum compressor ratios for maximum thermal efficiency are lower than for the simple cycle and similar to that for the intercooled regenerative cycle. The pressure ratio range where regeneration is possible is smaller than that for an intercooled regenerative cycle and this is due to the lower compressor discharge temperature due to intercooling. The turbine exhaust temperatures, on the other hand, are much higher for the reheated regenerative cycle.

For example, at a compressor pressure ratio of 10 and maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K, the turbine exhaust temperature is in the order of 1450 K (1177 Celsius). The corresponding case for the intercooled regenerative cycle is about 1200 K (927 Celsius). Thus ceramic-based materials such as silicon carbide and nitride must be employed for the heat exchanger when operating at the higher exhaust gas temperatures. Such materials have been used in the process industry for many years and can operate at temperatures in the order of 2000 K. Thus the reheated regenerative cycle should not be ruled out because of the higher turbine exhaust temperatures.

Thermal efficiencies of about 50% are possible with such cycles but they are lower than those of the intercooled cycle. This is primarily due to the lower ideal thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled regenerative cycle. On the other hand, bulky intercoolers and cooling systems are unnecessary and the self-contained nature of the gas turbine is preserved with the reheat–regenerative gas turbine cycle.

where T₂ = T₁ × c and T₅ = T₄ / c and when c = (Prₒ )γγ–1 and Pro = P₂ / P₁

Therefore, Equation 3.14 becomes:

Factorising (c – 1) = (c – c₁)(c + 1) and substituting into Equation 3.15 gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T¹ / T₄) (c (c + 1))

Multiplying and dividing by c gives:

ηₜₕ = 1 – (T₁ / T₄) (c (c + 1))                                      [3.16]
