Since the power turbine speed is constant, the power turbine non-dimensional speed Npt/√T₄, where Npt is the power turbine speed and T₄ is the exhaust gas temperature), actually increases as the ambient temperature decreases. The increase in non-dimensional speed would improve the power turbine efficiency, hence requiring slightly lower gas power for a given shaft power demand.

The thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Fig. 11.23 that the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Chapter 2 that increases in these parameters would increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 11.4.5 Trends in flow

The increase in compressor non-dimensional flow will require an increase in compressor inlet mass flow as the ambient temperature decreases. The improvement in thermal efficiency at lower ambient temperature will result in a lower fuel flow for a constant power output. These effects are seen in Fig. 11.25, which shows the trends in compressor mass flow and fuel flow. The fuel valve position is also shown and follows the fuel flow closely. The trend in air–fuel ratio will increase and is due to the increase in air flow and the reduction in fuel flow.

# 11.4.6 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperatures at inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 11.26. All the temperatures are observed decreasing with the fall in ambient temperature. The fall in the exhaust gas temperature occurs because the engine performance improves. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, also decreases with a fall in ambient temperature, although T₃/T₁ increases with the reduction in ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 11.23.

All these factors decrease the gas generator creep life usage and this can be seen in Fig. 11.28, which shows the trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage. Since the exhaust gas temperature also decreases, the power turbine creep life usage decreases and this can also be seen in Fig. 11.28. Since turbine creep lives are dependent on load and ambient conditions, proper monitoring of turbine creep life can increase periods between turbine overhaul and reduce the engine maintenance costs, thus improving engine life cycle costs.

# 11.4.5 Trends in flow

The increase in compressor non-dimensional flow will require an increase in compressor inlet mass flow as the ambient temperature decreases. The improvement in thermal efficiency at lower ambient temperature will result in a lower fuel flow for a constant power output. These effects are seen in Fig. 11.25, which shows the trends in compressor mass flow and fuel flow. The fuel valve position is also shown and follows the fuel flow closely. The trend in air–fuel ratio will increase and is due to the increase in air flow and the reduction in fuel flow.

# 11.4.6 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperatures at inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 11.26. All the temperatures are observed decreasing with the fall in ambient temperature. The fall in the exhaust gas temperature occurs because the engine performance improves. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, also decreases with a fall in ambient temperature, although T₃/T₁ increases with the reduction in ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 11.23.

Increase as the ambient temperature decreases, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as observed in Fig. 11.23. The power turbine inlet pressure, P₄, also increases during the transient and this is a result of the increase in compressor pressure ratio and constant gas generator pressure ratio, due to choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine.

# 11.4.8 Trends in turbine creep life

From the trends in speed and temperature (Figs 11.22 and 11.26, respectively) it is observed that the speed and turbine entry temperature decrease during the ambient temperature transient. It is also observed that the compressor discharge temperature decreases, thus resulting in a lower cooling air temperature.

All these factors decrease the gas generator creep life usage and this can be seen in Fig. 11.28, which shows the trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage. Since the exhaust gas temperature also decreases, the power turbine creep life usage decreases and this can also be seen in Fig. 11.28. Since turbine creep lives are dependent on load and ambient conditions, proper monitoring of turbine creep life can increase periods between turbine overhaul and reduce the engine maintenance costs, thus improving engine life cycle costs.

Since the power turbine speed is constant, the power turbine non-dimensional speed Npt/√T₄, where Npt is the power turbine speed and T₄ is the exhaust gas temperature), actually increases as the ambient temperature decreases. The increase in non-dimensional speed would improve the power turbine efficiency, hence requiring slightly lower gas power for a given shaft power demand.

These effects are seen in Fig. 11.25, which shows the trends in compressor mass flow and fuel flow. The fuel valve position is also shown and follows the fuel flow closely. The trend in air–fuel ratio will increase and is due to the increase in air flow and the reduction in fuel flow.

The trends in the temperatures at inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 11.26. All the temperatures are observed decreasing with the fall in ambient temperature. The fall in the exhaust gas temperature occurs because the engine performance improves. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, also decreases with a fall in ambient temperature, although T₃/T₁ increases with the reduction in ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 11.23.

From the trends in speed and temperature (Figs 11.22 and 11.26, respectively) it is observed that the speed and turbine entry temperature decrease during the ambient temperature transient. It is also observed that the compressor discharge temperature decreases, thus resulting in a lower cooling air temperature.

All these factors decrease the gas generator creep life usage and this can be seen in Fig. 11.28, which shows the trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage. Since the exhaust gas temperature also decreases, the power turbine creep life usage decreases and this can also be seen in Fig. 11.28. Since turbine creep lives are dependent on load and ambient conditions, proper monitoring of turbine creep life can increase periods between turbine overhaul and reduce the engine maintenance costs, thus improving engine life cycle costs.

Since the power turbine speed is constant, the power turbine non-dimensional speed Npt/√T₄, where Npt is the power turbine speed and T₄ is the exhaust gas temperature), actually increases as the ambient temperature decreases. The increase in non-dimensional speed would improve the power turbine efficiency, hence requiring slightly lower gas power for a given shaft power demand.

The thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Fig. 11.23 that the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Chapter 2 that increases in these parameters would increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

Increase as the ambient temperature decreases, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as observed in Fig. 11.23. The power turbine inlet pressure, P₄, also increases during the transient and this is a result of the increase in compressor pressure ratio and constant gas generator pressure ratio, due to choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine.

# 11.4.8 Trends in turbine creep life

From the trends in speed and temperature (Figs 11.22 and 11.26, respectively) it is observed that the speed and turbine entry temperature decrease during the ambient temperature transient. It is also observed that the compressor discharge temperature decreases, thus resulting in a lower cooling air temperature.

All these factors decrease the gas generator creep life usage and this can be seen in Fig. 11.28, which shows the trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage. Since the exhaust gas temperature also decreases, the power turbine creep life usage decreases and this can also be seen in Fig. 11.28. Since turbine creep lives are dependent on load and ambient conditions, proper monitoring of turbine creep life can increase periods between turbine overhaul and reduce the engine maintenance costs, thus improving engine life cycle costs.

Since the power turbine speed is constant, the power turbine non-dimensional speed Npt/√T₄, where Npt is the power turbine speed and T₄ is the exhaust gas temperature), actually increases as the ambient temperature decreases. The increase in non-dimensional speed would improve the power turbine efficiency, hence requiring slightly lower gas power for a given shaft power demand.

The thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Fig. 11.23 that the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature increase as the ambient temperature decreases.

# 11.26 Trends in temperature due to ambient temperature transient during low-power operation.

Increase as the ambient temperature decreases, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as observed in Fig. 11.23. The power turbine inlet pressure, P₄, also increases during the transient and this is a result of the increase in compressor pressure ratio and constant gas generator pressure ratio, due to choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine.

# 11.4.8 Trends in turbine creep life

From the trends in speed and temperature (Figs 11.22 and 11.26, respectively) it is observed that the speed and turbine entry temperature decrease during the ambient temperature transient. It is also observed that the compressor discharge temperature decreases, thus resulting in a lower cooling air temperature.

All these factors decrease the gas generator creep life usage and this can be seen in Fig. 11.28, which shows the trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage. Since the exhaust gas temperature also decreases, the power turbine creep life usage decreases and this can also be seen in Fig. 11.28. Since turbine creep lives are dependent on load and ambient conditions, proper monitoring of turbine creep life can increase periods between turbine overhaul and reduce the engine maintenance costs, thus improving engine life cycle costs.

Since the power turbine speed is constant, the power turbine non-dimensional speed Npt/√T₄, where Npt is the power turbine speed and T₄ is the exhaust gas temperature), actually increases as the ambient temperature decreases. The increase in non-dimensional speed would improve the power turbine efficiency, hence requiring slightly lower gas power for a given shaft power demand.

The thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Fig. 11.23 that the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Chapter 2 that increases in these parameters would increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 11.4.5 Trends in flow

The increase in compressor non-dimensional flow will require an increase in compressor inlet mass flow as the ambient temperature decreases. The improvement in thermal efficiency at lower ambient temperature will result in a lower fuel flow for a constant power output. These effects are seen in Fig. 11.25, which shows the trends in compressor mass flow and fuel flow. The fuel valve position is also shown and follows the fuel flow closely. The trend in air–fuel ratio will increase and is due to the increase in air flow and the reduction in fuel flow.

# 11.4.6 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperatures at inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 11.26. All the temperatures are observed decreasing with the fall in ambient temperature. The fall in the exhaust gas temperature occurs because the engine performance improves. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, also decreases with a fall in ambient temperature, although T₃/T₁ increases with the reduction in ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 11.23.

The thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Fig. 11.23 that the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Chapter 2 that increases in these parameters would increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 11.4.5 Trends in flow

The increase in compressor non-dimensional flow will require an increase in compressor inlet mass flow as the ambient temperature decreases. The improvement in thermal efficiency at lower ambient temperature will result in a lower fuel flow for a constant power output. These effects are seen in Fig. 11.25, which shows the trends in compressor mass flow and fuel flow. The fuel valve position is also shown and follows the fuel flow closely. The trend in air–fuel ratio will increase and is due to the increase in air flow and the reduction in fuel flow.

# 11.4.6 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperatures at inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 11.26. All the temperatures are observed decreasing with the fall in ambient temperature. The fall in the exhaust gas temperature occurs because the engine performance improves. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, also decreases with a fall in ambient temperature, although T₃/T₁ increases with the reduction in ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 11.23.

11.24 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during ambient temperature transient and low-power operation.

# 11.4.5 Trends in flow

The increase in compressor non-dimensional flow will require an increase in compressor inlet mass flow as the ambient temperature decreases. The improvement in thermal efficiency at lower ambient temperature will result in a lower fuel flow for a constant power output. These effects are seen in Fig. 11.25, which shows the trends in compressor mass flow and fuel flow. The fuel valve position is also shown and follows the fuel flow closely. The trend in air–fuel ratio will increase and is due to the increase in air flow and the reduction in fuel flow.

# 11.4.6 Trends in temperature

The trends in the temperatures at inlet and exit of each engine component are shown in Fig. 11.26. All the temperatures are observed decreasing with the fall in ambient temperature. The fall in the exhaust gas temperature occurs because the engine performance improves. Similarly, the turbine entry temperature, T₃, also decreases with a fall in ambient temperature, although T₃/T₁ increases with the reduction in ambient temperature, as shown in Fig. 11.23.

# 11.4.7 Trends in pressure

The trends in the pressure during the ambient temperature transient are shown in Fig. 11.27. The compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure

# 11.26 Trends in temperature due to ambient temperature transient during low-power operation.

Increase as the ambient temperature decreases, due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio, as observed in Fig. 11.23. The power turbine inlet pressure, P₄, also increases during the transient and this is a result of the increase in compressor pressure ratio and constant gas generator pressure ratio, due to choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine.

# 11.4.8 Trends in turbine creep life

From the trends in speed and temperature (Figs 11.22 and 11.26, respectively) it is observed that the speed and turbine entry temperature decrease during the ambient temperature transient. It is also observed that the compressor discharge temperature decreases, thus resulting in a lower cooling air temperature.

All these factors decrease the gas generator creep life usage and this can be seen in Fig. 11.28, which shows the trends in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage. Since the exhaust gas temperature also decreases, the power turbine creep life usage decreases and this can also be seen in Fig. 11.28. Since turbine creep lives are dependent on load and ambient conditions, proper monitoring of turbine creep life can increase periods between turbine overhaul and reduce the engine maintenance costs, thus improving engine life cycle costs.

Since the power turbine speed is constant, the power turbine non-dimensional speed Npt/√T₄, where Npt is the power turbine speed and T₄ is the exhaust gas temperature), actually increases as the ambient temperature decreases. The increase in non-dimensional speed would improve the power turbine efficiency, hence requiring slightly lower gas power for a given shaft power demand.

The thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Fig. 11.23 that the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature increase as the ambient temperature decreases. It was seen in Chapter 2 that increases in these parameters would increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.
