# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr. If we assume that the reheater pressure loss, P4/P5, is constant and ignore bleeds, any increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in W4√T4/P4 to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater (Equation 8.14).

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine. The increase in HP turbine work is absorbed in the HP compressor by increasing the HP spool speed as illustrated in Fig. ",How does reheat affect the compressor pressure ratio in a gas turbine?,A3,"With reheat, the compressor's pressure ratio rises, a direct result of the elevated turbine entry temperature enhancing the compressor's performance.",0.7265625,0.87109375,3.21875,1.4375,0.455078125

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine. The increase in HP turbine work is absorbed in the HP compressor by increasing the HP spool speed as illustrated in Fig. ",How does reheat influence the turbine entry temperature in gas turbines?,A4,"Reheat leads to higher turbine entry temperatures, needed to offset the GG turbine's decreased pressure ratio and maintain system balance.",1.6171875,1.84375,3.515625,1.515625,0.30078125

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant.

and the flow identity at the exit of the reheat chamber:

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr. If we assume that the reheater pressure loss, P4/P5, is constant and ignore bleeds, any increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in W4√T4/P4 to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater (Equation 8.14).

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr. If we assume that the reheater pressure loss, P4/P5, is constant and ignore bleeds, any increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in W4√T4/P4 to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater (Equation 8.14).

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine. The increase in HP turbine work is absorbed in the HP compressor by increasing the HP spool speed as illustrated in Fig. ",What assumption is made about the power turbine when analyzing reheat effects?,A2,"The analysis presumes a choked power turbine, keeping W5√T5/P5 steady across different reheat levels for flow compatibility.",2.28125,2.375,3.546875,1.6328125,0.6484375

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine.

The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine. The increase in HP turbine work is absorbed in the HP compressor by increasing the HP spool speed as illustrated in Fig. ",What assumption is made about the power turbine when analyzing reheat effects?,A5,"Assuming the power turbine is choked allows W5√T5/P5 to remain unchanged during reheat, facilitating flow compatibility studies.",2.3125,2.390625,3.609375,1.5625,0.55859375

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr.

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr. If we assume that the reheater pressure loss, P4/P5, is constant and ignore bleeds, any increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in W4√T4/P4 to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater (Equation 8.14).

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃.

Considering the flow identity (Equation 8.13), describing the non-dimensional flow at exit from the GG turbine:

W4PT4 = W3PT3 × P3 × T4 × W4

[8.13]

and the flow identity at the exit of the reheat chamber:

W5PT5 = W4PT4 × P4 × T5 × W5

[8.14]

The reheater exit non-dimensional flow, W5√T5/P5, must be ‘swallowed’ by the power turbine. If it is assumed that the power turbine is choked, then W5√T5/P5 will remain constant as the amount of reheat is varied, which is given by

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr. If we assume that the reheater pressure loss, P4/P5, is constant and ignore bleeds, any increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in W4√T4/P4 to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater (Equation 8.14). However, W4√T4/P4 is the exit non-dimensional flow from the GG turbine. Assuming the GG turbine is choked and ignoring bleeds, the

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Making the usual assumptions,  W₃√T₃/P₃ and  W₅√T₅/P₅ will be constant (vertical compressor speed lines and choked turbine nozzle, respectively). Assuming constant pressure losses and ignoring bleeds, and W = W P₄/P₅ will be constant.

Operating at the constant maximum cycle temperature, T₅, thus for a given minimum cycle temperature, T₃ (which would ideally be equal to the ambient temperature, T₁–perfect intercooler), the HP compressor pressure ratio must remain essentially constant as the engine load changes in order to maintain the flow compatibility between the HP compressor and turbine (Equation 8.12). Thus, for a given compressor inlet temperature, all the pressure ratio change takes place in the LP compressor, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24. This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

This is in contrast with the previous case, (no VIGV), where it was determined that all the pressure ratio changes take place in the HP compressor rather than in the LP compressor.

A similar off-design behaviour occurs with an intercooled three-shaft gas turbine operating with a variable geometry free power turbine. When the power turbine capacity is adjusted such that the turbine entry temperature remains constant at part load conditions, the operating point on the HP compressor remains unchanged and all the pressure ratio change occurs in the LP compressor. It is assumed that the intercooling process takes place between the LP and HP compressors. This result is due to the LP turbine remaining choked and therefore forcing the HP turbine pressure ratio to be fixed. Thus the HP turbine non-dimensional temperature drop is also fixed. Due to the constant turbine entry temperature at off-design conditions, the HP turbine temperature drop will also remain constant. Since the HP compressor inlet temperature is maintained at a constant value due to intercooling the HP spool, the power balance between the HP compressor and turbine will maintain the HP compressor non-dimensional speed at a fixed value. As the turbine entry temperature and the HP compressor inlet temperature remain constant, due to the effect of the variable geometry power turbine and intercooling, respectively, the operating point on the HP compressor characteristic will be fixed where the HP compressor non-dimensional speed intersects the line of constant maximum to minimum temperature ratio on the HP compressor characteristic.

It must be pointed out that, when the design point performance is optimised for maximum thermal efficiency (i.e. approximately equal LP and HP compressor pressure ratio for a regenerative cycle), this optimum split in compressor ratios cannot be maintained at off-design conditions. Thus intercooled cycles may not achieve the maximum possible thermal efficiency at off-design conditions due to intercooling.

When we

apply reheat to such an engine, as shown in Fig. 8.25, the reheat is usually applied between the gas generator and power turbine and this affects the matching of the turbines resulting in a redistribution of the turbine pressure ratios in order to satisfy the flow compatibility between them. Considering the flow identity (Equation 8.13), describing the non-dimensional flow at exit from the GG turbine:

W4PT4 = W3PT3 × P3 × T4 × W4

[8.13]

and the flow identity at the exit of the reheat chamber:

W5PT5 = W4PT4 × P4 × T5 × W5

[8.14]

The reheater exit non-dimensional flow, W5√T5/P5, must be ‘swallowed’ by the power turbine. If it is assumed that the power turbine is choked, then W5√T5/P5 will remain constant as the amount of reheat is varied, which is given by

Tr (reheat temperature ratio) = T5/T4. Increasing reheat will increase T5/T4 and thus Tr. If we assume that the reheater pressure loss, P4/P5, is constant and ignore bleeds, any increase in reheat must be accompanied by a decrease in W4√T4/P4 to satisfy the flow compatibility in the reheater (Equation 8.14). However, W4√T4/P4 is the exit non-dimensional flow from the GG turbine. Assuming the GG turbine is choked and ignoring bleeds, the

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Reduction in W₄√T₄/P₄ will result in a decrease in GG turbine pressure ratio, P₃/P₄, as required by Equation 8.13. (Although there is an increase in T₄/T₃ due to the decrease in P₃/P₄, the effect of the reduction in GG turbine pressure P₃/P₄ is dominant). The effect of reheat on the GG turbine pressure ratio is illustrated in Fig. 8.26, which shows the matching of the GG and power turbine characteristics due to the application of reheat. The operating point on the GG turbine characteristic decreases in pressure ratio as the amount of reheat, Tr, is increased (from (1) to (2) in Fig. 8.26). Note the zero reheat line corresponds to the case when Tr = 1.

Reheat is usually applied when the gas generator is operating at its maximum speed or at the maximum turbine entry temperature. However, the decrease in the GG turbine pressure will decrease the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. If we are continuously operating at the maximum compressor speed and a given compressor inlet temperature, T₁, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√T₁ will be constant during the application of reheat. From the discussion above, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, will be approximately constant. From the work compatibility equation or power balance Equation 8.4, the decrease in ΔT₃₄/T₃ must result in an increase in T₃/T₁ and for a given T₁, will therefore increase the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Assuming that the compressor speed lines are approximately vertical, therefore there is little variation in the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁ with compressor pressure, P₂/P₁. For a choked gas generator turbine, W₃√T₃/P₃, is a constant) and from Equation 8.5, which describes the:

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

flow compatibility of the gas generator, an increase in T₃/T₁ will result in an increase in the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁. Thus reheat increases the compressor pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.27, which shows the change in the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to reheat.

Thus reheat increases the turbine entry temperature and will contribute further in the increase in the power output of the gas turbine. However, the turbine creep life may be compromised severely and the application of reheat would normally require a variable geometry power turbine. It has been shown that increasing the power turbine capacity will increase the GG turbine pressure ratio as illustrated in Fig. 8.26. Thus by increasing the power turbine capacity sufficiently during reheat, it is possible to maintain the design turbine entry temperature and compressor pressure ratio. (It is worth pointing out that, when jet engines employ reheat or afterburning to augment the thrust, they often incorporate a variable geometry propelling nozzle, which is open during reheat operation.)

A three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine will usually apply reheat between the LP turbine and the power turbine. The redistribution of pressure ratio across the three turbines during the reheat operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.28. In this case, we observe the decrease in the LP turbine pressure ratio due to the application of reheat results in a decrease in LP turbine work. Hence a higher LP turbine inlet temperature is required to maintain the power balance of the LP spool when operating at a constant.

Since the HP turbine is shielded from the effects of reheat due to the choking of the LP turbine, the increase in LP turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in the HP turbine entry temperature, thus increasing the work done by the HP turbine. The increase in HP turbine work is absorbed in the HP compressor by increasing the HP spool speed as illustrated in Fig. ",Why is a variable geometry power turbine beneficial when applying reheat?,A5,Adjusting the power turbine's geometry during reheat helps maintain the desired GG turbine pressure ratio and overall engine efficiency.,1.953125,2.3125,3.453125,1.484375,0.4296875
