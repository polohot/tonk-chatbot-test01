Since the compression process is adiabatic, the work input, W, is equal to the change in stagnation enthalpy, and this is easily derived from the steady flow energy equation Q – W = ΔH. Since Q = 0:

ΔH = λUCa(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.4]

ΔH =  Ca (tan ( β₁) – tan ( β₂))                                  [4.5]

U2 U

ΔH/U² is known as the stage-loading coefficient, ψ, and Ca/U is known as the flow coefficient, Φ. We can rearrange Equation 4.5 in terms of the air outlet angle of the previous stator α₁ and rotor air outlet angle β₂. These angles are determined largely by the blade geometry of the rotor and stator and, in the ideal case, may be assumed independent of the air incidence angles to the rotor, β₁ and the stator, α₂.

# Compressors

Since

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.

ΔH =  Ca (tan ( β₁) – tan ( β₂))                                  [4.5]

U2 U

ΔH/U² is known as the stage-loading coefficient, ψ, and Ca/U is known as the flow coefficient, Φ. We can rearrange Equation 4.5 in terms of the air outlet angle of the previous stator α₁ and rotor air outlet angle β₂. These angles are determined largely by the blade geometry of the rotor and stator and, in the ideal case, may be assumed independent of the air incidence angles to the rotor, β₁ and the stator, α₂.

# Compressors

Since

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.

Since the compression process is adiabatic, the work input, W, is equal to the change in stagnation enthalpy, and this is easily derived from the steady flow energy equation Q – W = ΔH. Since Q = 0:

ΔH = λUCa(tan(β₁) – tan(β₂)) [4.4]

U2 U

ΔH/U² is known as the stage-loading coefficient, ψ, and Ca/U is known as the flow coefficient, Φ. We can rearrange Equation 4.5 in terms of the air outlet angle of the previous stator α₁ and rotor air outlet angle β₂. These angles are determined largely by the blade geometry of the rotor and stator and, in the ideal case, may be assumed independent of the air incidence angles to the rotor, β₁ and the stator, α₂.

# Compressors

Since

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.

ΔH =  Ca (tan ( β₁) – tan ( β₂))                                  [4.5]

U2 U

ΔH/U² is known as the stage-loading coefficient, ψ, and Ca/U is known as the flow coefficient, Φ. We can rearrange Equation 4.5 in terms of the air outlet angle of the previous stator α₁ and rotor air outlet angle β₂. These angles are determined largely by the blade geometry of the rotor and stator and, in the ideal case, may be assumed independent of the air incidence angles to the rotor, β₁ and the stator, α₂.

# Compressors

Since

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency.

U2 U

ΔH/U² is known as the stage-loading coefficient, ψ, and Ca/U is known as the flow coefficient, Φ. We can rearrange Equation 4.5 in terms of the air outlet angle of the previous stator α₁ and rotor air outlet angle β₂. These angles are determined largely by the blade geometry of the rotor and stator and, in the ideal case, may be assumed independent of the air incidence angles to the rotor, β₁ and the stator, α₂.

# Compressors

Since

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.

ΔH =  Ca (tan ( β₁) – tan ( β₂))                                  [4.5]

U2 U

ΔH/U² is known as the stage-loading coefficient, ψ, and Ca/U is known as the flow coefficient, Φ. We can rearrange Equation 4.5 in terms of the air outlet angle of the previous stator α₁ and rotor air outlet angle β₂. These angles are determined largely by the blade geometry of the rotor and stator and, in the ideal case, may be assumed independent of the air incidence angles to the rotor, β₁ and the stator, α₂.

# Compressors

Since

ΔVw = U – Cw₁ – Cw₂ = U – Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₂))

we can rewrite Equation 4.5 as

ΔH = 1 – Ca (tan (α₁) – tan (β₂)) [4.6]

Since we have assumed α₁ and β₂ to be constant, (tan(α₁) – tan(β₂)) is also constant, and Equation 4.6 can be plotted as a straight line, as shown in Figure 4.9.

From Equation 4.6 we see that the stage-loading coefficient tends to 1 when the flow coefficient tends to zero. This implies that the blade speed, U, equals the change in tangential or whirl velocity, ΔVw. The velocity triangles described previously will be rectangular and the diffusion will be excessive, resulting in very low stage efficiency. For satisfactory operation, the stage-loading coefficient should not exceed about 0.5 (subsonic airfoils) if we are to achieve good stage efficiency.

Figure 4.9 also shows the actual characteristic. The deviation from the ideal characteristic is due to losses in the compression stage. The losses in a stage result from the stagnation pressure loss or profile loss across the blade. In an ideal stage the blade outlet angle and air exit angle will be the same (i.e. the deviation, δα, which is the difference between the air exit angle, ₂ and the exit blade angle will be zero) as shown in Fig. 4.10.
