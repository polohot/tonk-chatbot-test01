# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

OP =  Kc ∫ err d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

The integral output is reset, normally to 100%, should the fuel valve reach a limiting condition such as a fully opened position. Figure 10.3 illustrates integral wind-up due to an insufficient fuel valve size.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

Further details on control systems may be found in Shaw and Sivanandam.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

Further details on control systems may be found in Shaw and Sivanandam.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

OP =  Kc ∫ err d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

The integral output is reset, normally to 100%, should the fuel valve reach a limiting condition such as a fully opened position. Figure 10.3 illustrates integral wind-up due to an insufficient fuel valve size.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

Further details on control systems may be found in Shaw and Sivanandam.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point.

The integral output is reset, normally to 100%, should the fuel valve reach a limiting condition such as a fully opened position. Figure 10.3 illustrates integral wind-up due to an insufficient fuel valve size.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

The control system shown in Fig. ",How does the control system protect the gas turbine from exceeding design limits?,A4,"Protection is achieved through real-time monitoring and adjustment of engine parameters, ensuring that no single operational limit is exceeded, thereby preserving engine integrity.",2.0625,2.234375,3.4375,1.5,0.2890625

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

The control system shown in Fig. ",What are the common limiting conditions for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine?,A3,"The engine is safeguarded by limits on exhaust gas temperature, gas turbine speed, aerodynamic speed to prevent compressor stall/surge, and power turbine speed to ensure mechanical integrity.",2.578125,2.828125,3.671875,1.484375,0.5859375

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

OP =  Kc ∫ err d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

The integral output is reset, normally to 100%, should the fuel valve reach a limiting condition such as a fully opened position. Figure 10.3 illustrates integral wind-up due to an insufficient fuel valve size.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%.

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

Further details on control systems may be found in Shaw and Sivanandam.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.

# 10.1 PID loop

A closed loop control system normally achieves the output using a proportional (P), integral (I) and derivative (D) action or a PID loop. Such a system is also known as a three-term controller.

# 10.1.1 Proportional (P) only controller

The proportional action results by producing an output which is proportional to the error plus a bias, and the output from a proportional only controller is given by Equation 10.1:

OP = Kc × err + C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10.1]

where Kc is the proportional gain, err is the error between the process output (power output in this case) and the set point (which is the required power output from the gas turbine). C is the proportional bias.

The drawback of a proportional only controller is that it will leave a steady-state error known as the proportional offset, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. The proportional offset can be eliminated by adjusting the fuel flow manually until the proportional offset (steady error) is zero.

# 10.1.2 Proportional and integral (PI) controller

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

OP =  Kc ∫ err d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

Figure 10.3 illustrates integral wind-up due to an insufficient fuel valve size.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%.

The manual reset described above can be automated by including the integral component or action of the PID controller. The output from the integral controller is given by Equation 10.2.

# 10.2 Proportional offset due to proportional action only.

OP =  Kc ∫ err d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti ⋅ t                                           [10.2]

where Ti is the integral time or reset time. The integral action occurs as a result of the error being integrated continuously or summed up. Thus, the proportional offset is eliminated when both proportional and integral control are employed and there is no need for resetting the proportional offset manually. This is often referred to as automatic reset. The addition of integral action can also result in drawbacks and this is referred to as integral wind-up. Wind-up can occur when the conditions are such that the output from the process (in this case the gas turbine power output) is unaffected by the controller action. For example, it occurs when the fuel valve remains full open due to insufficient valve size before the power demand from the gas turbine is reached. In this event, the control system responds by increasing the integral output in an attempt to increase the fuel valve position, thus increasing the fuel flow to the engine. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further change in fuel flow is possible and power output from the engine remains unchanged. As long as this condition remains, the integral output will continue to increase, but with no change in the power output of the engine.

If the power demand is now reduced sufficiently (change in set point) so that the fuel valve will not be fully opened, the control system will still respond by keeping the valve fully opened because of the winding-up of the integral output. The valve will remain fully opened until the integral output has completely unwound itself before responding to the change in the set point. This rather unexpected response from the control system is referred to...

As integral wind-up. The period of time the control system remains in this situation depends on the amount of wind-up. The means to rectify this problem are quite simple. The integral output is reset, normally to 100%, should the fuel valve reach a limiting condition such as a fully opened position. Figure 10.3 illustrates integral wind-up due to an insufficient fuel valve size.

# 10.1.3 Proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller

The derivative output enhances the controller output during a transient response. It is normally used when the response of the system is very slow (e.g. furnaces), but is often omitted in gas turbine control systems. It should be noted that derivative control produces no action when a steady-state error occurs due to the proportional offset or integral wind-up, as the rate of change of the error under these conditions will be zero. The PID loop controller may be written as:

OP = err × Kc + Kc ∫ err d + d (err)

Ti ⋅ t Kc × Td dt [10.3]

Where Td is the derivative time constant.

Some control manufacturers prefer to use the concept of proportional band, which is defined as the change in the input to cause a change in the output from zero to 100%. Thus, the proportional gain where PB is the proportional band. The terms Kc is given by Kc PB, Kc/Ti and Kc × Td in Equation 10.3 can also be expressed as IG and DG, which correspond to the integral gain and derivative gain, respectively. Substituting PB, IG and DG into Equation 10.3:

# 266 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

OP = err 100 + IG∫ err d + DG d (err) [10.4]

where OP is the controller output, PB is the proportional band, %, IG is the integral gain, and DG is the derivative gain.

Further details on control systems may be found in Shaw and Sivanandam.

# 10.2 Signal selection

It has been stated that the control system must achieve the necessary output, but it must also protect the gas turbine from exceeding any engine design limits. An engine has various limiting conditions, which prevent any damage to the engine. The following are the most common for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine.

1. The exhaust gas temperature limit (EGT) is used to prevent the turbines from overheating and resulting in premature turbine blade failure.
2. The gas turbine speed limit prevents the rotating parts from becoming over-stressed, resulting in failure.
3. High performance engines operate at high compressor pressure ratios, and an upper limit on the aerodynamic or non-dimensional speed may be imposed so as to prevent stalling and surging of the compressor at high speeds.
4. A power turbine speed limit is used to prevent the rotating parts of the power turbine from becoming over-stressed.
