It is observed that the EGT remains constant throughout the transient and this is due to the opening of the VIGV as the ambient pressure decreases to maintain the EGT in the set point. The increase in specific work results in the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. The increase in T₃ is smaller compared with the previous case, and this is due primarily to a small decrease in compressor flow rate during the transient caused by the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow, resulting from the opening of the VIGV. The increase in compressor pressure ratio also results in a small increase in the compressor discharge temperatures.

It is observed that the EGT remains constant throughout the transient and this is due to the opening of the VIGV as the ambient pressure decreases to maintain the EGT in the set point. The increase in specific work results in the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. The increase in T₃ is smaller compared with the previous case, and this is due primarily to a small decrease in compressor flow rate during the transient caused by the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow, resulting from the opening of the VIGV. The increase in compressor pressure ratio also results in a small increase in the compressor discharge temperatures.

Trends in temperature during ambient pressure transient.

It has been observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases during the transient, as shown in Fig. ",What is the significance of the VIGV opening in maintaining EGT during the transient?,A4,"The text highlights the VIGV's role in EGT stability, as its opening counteracts ambient pressure decreases.",1.53125,1.6953125,3.15625,1.4375,0.3984375

It is observed that the EGT remains constant throughout the transient and this is due to the opening of the VIGV as the ambient pressure decreases to maintain the EGT in the set point. The increase in specific work results in the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. The increase in T₃ is smaller compared with the previous case, and this is due primarily to a small decrease in compressor flow rate during the transient caused by the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow, resulting from the opening of the VIGV. The increase in compressor pressure ratio also results in a small increase in the compressor discharge temperatures.

Trends in temperature during ambient pressure transient.

It has been observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases during the transient, as shown in Fig. ",Why does the EGT remain constant throughout the transient according to the text?,A5,EGT stability during the transient is attributed to VIGV operations that counteract ambient pressure variations.,1.515625,1.5859375,3.3125,1.3671875,0.427734375

It is observed that the EGT remains constant throughout the transient and this is due to the opening of the VIGV as the ambient pressure decreases to maintain the EGT in the set point. The increase in specific work results in the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. The increase in T₃ is smaller compared with the previous case, and this is due primarily to a small decrease in compressor flow rate during the transient caused by the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow, resulting from the opening of the VIGV. The increase in compressor pressure ratio also results in a small increase in the compressor discharge temperatures.
