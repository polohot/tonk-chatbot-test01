# 7.2 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine

Single-shaft gas turbines are used widely in power generation. In this application the gas turbine is maintained at a constant speed, which corresponds to the synchronous speed of the electrical generator. Due to design considerations, if the gas turbine speed is different from that of the generator synchronous speed, a gearbox is used to step up/down the gas turbine speed to match the required generator speed. Nonetheless, the gas turbine speed is constant with varying generation load. A schematic representation of a single-shaft gas turbine is shown in Fig. 7.4.

The air enters the compressor at station 1 and exits the compressor at station 2 after compression. The high-pressure air enters the combustion chamber, where fuel is burnt and the air–gas temperature is increased. The high-pressure, high-temperature gases are expanded through the turbine and exit the gas turbine at station 4. Part of the turbine power, typically about 50%, is used to drive the compressor and the remaining turbine power drives the load, which is normally a generator.

# 178 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The air enters the compressor at station 1 and exits the compressor at station 2 after compression. The high-pressure air enters the combustion chamber, where fuel is burnt and the air–gas temperature is increased. The high-pressure, high-temperature gases are expanded through the turbine and exit the gas turbine at station 4. Part of the turbine power, typically about 50%, is used to drive the compressor and the remaining turbine power drives the load, which is normally a generator.

Referring to Fig. ",How is the turbine power utilized in a single-shaft gas turbine?,A5,Power distribution is roughly equal between driving the compressor and the generator.,1.515625,1.53125,3.28125,1.2109375,0.09716796875

# 7.2 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine

Single-shaft gas turbines are used widely in power generation. In this application the gas turbine is maintained at a constant speed, which corresponds to the synchronous speed of the electrical generator. Due to design considerations, if the gas turbine speed is different from that of the generator synchronous speed, a gearbox is used to step up/down the gas turbine speed to match the required generator speed. Nonetheless, the gas turbine speed is constant with varying generation load. A schematic representation of a single-shaft gas turbine is shown in Fig. 7.4.

# 7.2 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine

Single-shaft gas turbines are used widely in power generation. In this application the gas turbine is maintained at a constant speed, which corresponds to the synchronous speed of the electrical generator. Due to design considerations, if the gas turbine speed is different from that of the generator synchronous speed, a gearbox is used to step up/down the gas turbine speed to match the required generator speed. Nonetheless, the gas turbine speed is constant with varying generation load. A schematic representation of a single-shaft gas turbine is shown in Fig. 7.4.

The air enters the compressor at station 1 and exits the compressor at station 2 after compression. The high-pressure air enters the combustion chamber, where fuel is burnt and the air–gas temperature is increased. The high-pressure, high-temperature gases are expanded through the turbine and exit the gas turbine at station 4. Part of the turbine power, typically about 50%, is used to drive the compressor and the remaining turbine power drives the load, which is normally a generator.

# 7.2 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine

Single-shaft gas turbines are used widely in power generation. In this application the gas turbine is maintained at a constant speed, which corresponds to the synchronous speed of the electrical generator. Due to design considerations, if the gas turbine speed is different from that of the generator synchronous speed, a gearbox is used to step up/down the gas turbine speed to match the required generator speed. Nonetheless, the gas turbine speed is constant with varying generation load. A schematic representation of a single-shaft gas turbine is shown in Fig. 7.4.

The air enters the compressor at station 1 and exits the compressor at station 2 after compression. The high-pressure air enters the combustion chamber, where fuel is burnt and the air–gas temperature is increased. The high-pressure, high-temperature gases are expanded through the turbine and exit the gas turbine at station 4.
