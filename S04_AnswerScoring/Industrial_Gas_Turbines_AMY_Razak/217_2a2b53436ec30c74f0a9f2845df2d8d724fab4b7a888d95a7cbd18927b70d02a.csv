This is due to the engine being able to increase the gas generator speed and exhaust gas temperature to maintain the generator power demand.

# 13.2.2 Trends in speed

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow. Since the compressor inlet temperature does not change, the increase in gas generator speed results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.16, which shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during fouling when operating at low power.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow. Since the compressor inlet temperature does not change, the increase in gas generator speed results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow. Since the compressor inlet temperature does not change, the increase in gas generator speed results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

13.18 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.2.7 Trends in turbine creep life

It has been observed that the gas generator speed and the turbine entry temperature increase with compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

13.18 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

13.18 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance.

The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

13.18 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

13.18 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

13.18 Trends in power and thermal efficiency during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the compressor inlet temperature does not change, the increase in gas generator speed results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.16, which shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during fouling when operating at low power.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow. Since the compressor inlet temperature does not change, the increase in gas generator speed results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.16, which shows the trends in the gas generator and compressor non-dimensional speeds during fouling when operating at low power.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow. Since the compressor inlet temperature does not change, the increase in gas generator speed results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.

Since the engine is not on an operating limit during low power operation, compressor fouling will result in an increased gas generator speed in order to maintain the power demand, which is met by increasing the fuel flow.

# 13.17 Trends in temperature during compressor fouling when operating at low power.

Entry temperature and the primary zone temperature are all increasing during fouling. This is due to the loss in engine performance, thus requiring higher operating temperatures to maintain the generator power demand. However, the compressor exit temperature remains essentially constant during compressor fouling and any slight increase is due to the loss in compressor efficiency.

# 13.2.4 Trends in power and efficiency

The trends in power and thermal efficiency are shown in Fig. 13.18. The generator power output remains on the set point (17.5 MW), thus the gas turbine power output and the gas power also remain constant during fouling. The gas turbine thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency decrease during compressor fouling and this is due to the loss in engine performance. Thus, compressor fouling at low power has no effect on revenue, as the power demand can be met, since no engine limits are reached. However, the loss in thermal efficiency will result in increased fuel costs.

In industries where fuel costs are minimal, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, compressor fouling is of little consequence if engines operate at relatively low powers. Thus, compressor washes can be infrequent. However, if dirt and debris are allowed to accumulate on the compressor blades, particularly on the high pressure stages where such debris can become baked on due to the higher temperatures in these compressor stages, subsequent washing of the compressor may not return the compressor back to its best performance. This will result in reduced revenue when maximum power demand is required. Thus frequent washing is important but has to be balanced with the loss of production due to downtime during washing.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The compressor operating point is small compared with the case when the effect of fouling on engine performance at high operating powers is considered. There is an increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position during fouling and this is due to the lower thermal efficiency as discussed before. Since there is an increase in fuel flow and a decrease in compressor inlet flow, the reduction in combustion airflow causes the air–fuel ratio to decrease during fouling.

# 13.2.6 Trends in pressure ratio and pressure

The trends in the pressure ratio during compressor fouling are shown in Fig. 13.20. Due to little movement in the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power, only a small change in the compressor pressure ratio occurs during fouling at these power output conditions. There is a slight increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and this is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature during compressor fouling. As there is only a small change in these pressure ratios, the changes in pressure trends during compressor fouling are also small and are shown in Fig. 13.21.
