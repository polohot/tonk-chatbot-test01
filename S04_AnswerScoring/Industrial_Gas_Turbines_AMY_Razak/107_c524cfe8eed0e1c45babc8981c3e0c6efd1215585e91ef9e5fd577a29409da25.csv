# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.

# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.

# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.

# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.

# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.

# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.

# 7 Off-design performance prediction

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed the evaluation of the design point performance of a gas turbine. The designer selects a pressure ratio, component efficiencies and a maximum cycle temperature T₃ (also known as the turbine entry temperature or TET) to achieve a required engine performance. The design point calculation determines the thermal efficiency and airflow rate for a given power demand. This information is used in the design of the turbomachinery and combustion system as described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The design of the turbomachinery and combustion system is a specialist area and the designer’s experience is used to achieve the desired performance of these engine components.

An engine designed on this principle will usually achieve the design performance. However, gas turbines have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions outside their design conditions and this state is referred to as the off-design performance. An off-design condition manifests itself due to a change in engine load and ambient conditions. For example, the ambient temperature may change significantly from winter to summer and will have a significant impact on the engine performance. Hence, the engine will not only have to perform satisfactorily at the design conditions, but the off-design performance is also of paramount importance.

This chapter discusses the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines. An interesting alternative method for the prediction of the off-design performance of gas turbines is described in Saravanamuttoo et al.1 Also, much information on gas turbine performance can be found in Walsh and Fletcher.2

# 7.1 Component matching and component characteristics

The off-design performance of a gas turbine is determined by the interaction of the engine components, namely the compressors, combustors and turbines.

# Off-design performance prediction

The interaction of these gas turbine components is often referred to as component matching. Typical characteristics for a compressor and a turbine are shown in Figs 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. Although a wide operating range is shown, the component interaction or the matching of the gas turbine components will restrict the operating range severely. Therefore, the performance of the component must be satisfactory in this restricted region to achieve satisfactory performance at off-design conditions.
