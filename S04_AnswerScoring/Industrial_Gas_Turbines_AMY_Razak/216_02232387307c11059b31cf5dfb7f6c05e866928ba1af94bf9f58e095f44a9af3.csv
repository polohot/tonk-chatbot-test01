Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

13.11 Variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for a clean and fouled compressor, respectively.

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling. The simulation of the compressor fouling is the

The movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power is shown in Fig. 13.15. ",How does compressor fouling affect NOx emissions and why is this effect considered misleading?,A4,"Fouling reduces NOx emissions, but since power output also falls, the true impact on emissions per power unit is not beneficial.",2.453125,2.78125,3.703125,1.5234375,0.35546875

Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling when engine is operating at a control limit.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling. The simulation of the compressor fouling is the

Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions.

Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling. The simulation of the compressor fouling is the

The movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power is shown in Fig. 13.15. ",What distinguishes the effect of compressor fouling at high power from its effect at low power?,A2,"Fouling impacts high power operations by pushing the engine to its limits, unlike at low power where limits are not reached.",1.96875,1.9453125,3.4375,1.3984375,0.369140625

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

13.11 Variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for a clean and fouled compressor, respectively.

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.

The movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power is shown in Fig. 13.15. ",What does Figure 13.11 illustrate about the relationship between ambient temperature and power output for clean versus fouled compressors?,A4,"The figure demonstrates that fouled compressors experience larger power output losses, especially at reduced ambient temperatures.",2.5,2.46875,3.734375,1.3515625,0.498046875

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling when engine is operating at a control limit.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

# 13.2.1 Compressor characteristic

The movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power is shown in Fig. 13.15. ",What does the text suggest about the impact of compressor fouling on engine performance at different compressor non-dimensional speeds?,A2,"The effect of fouling is more pronounced at lower non-dimensional speeds, particularly affecting LP compressor stages.",2.125,2.390625,3.578125,1.4765625,0.248046875

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.

13.11 Variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for a clean and fouled compressor, respectively.

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling. The simulation of the compressor fouling is the

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling when engine is operating at a control limit.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.

",What impact does ambient temperature have on the power output loss due to compressor fouling?,A4,"Fouling's impact on power output is heightened at lower ambient temperatures, particularly in speed-limited scenarios.",1.5078125,1.6875,3.390625,1.390625,0.10546875

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling when engine is operating at a control limit.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

13.11 Variation of gas turbine power output with ambient temperature for a clean and fouled compressor, respectively.

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling. The simulation of the compressor fouling is the

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling when engine is operating at a control limit.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.13 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Represent these running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis, as shown in Fig. 13.13. The displacement of the running line due to compressor fouling is shown clearly. The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

# 13.2 Compressor fouling (low operating power)

The effect of compressor fouling when the gas turbine is operating at high enough powers such that the engine is always on an operating limit has been discussed. The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling. The simulation of the compressor fouling is the

The movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic during fouling when operating at low power is shown in Fig. 13.15. ",What is the significance of representing running lines on a compressor non-dimensional flow versus non-dimensional speed basis?,A4,"The method vividly demonstrates fouling-induced running line displacement, correlating with the fouling severity.",1.546875,1.5,3.1875,1.46875,0.181640625

The figure also shows the decrease in CO2, which is proportional to the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow during fouling decreases, we also observe a decrease in CO2. However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.10 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to compressor fouling when engine is operating at a control limit.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

However, the increase in the CO2 index (also shown in Fig. 13.10) implies an increase in CO2 emissions in real terms.

It has been stated that the NOx emissions decrease during fouling, and this effect seems to indicate that fouling has a beneficial effect on gas turbine emissions. However, this is somewhat misleading as the power output from the gas turbine has also decreased. The correct picture only appears when the simulator is run at the reduced power output caused by fouling and when no performance deterioration is present. It is only then that the emissions due to a fouled compressor are indeed observed to be higher than those from a clean engine and the user is left to simulate this case.

# 13.1.11 Effect of ambient temperature and compressor fouling on engine performance

The previous discussions on compressor fouling considered the case when the ambient temperature was 15 degrees Celsius. The effect of a change in ambient temperature during compressor fouling is now considered by summarising the effect on gas turbine power output.

Figure 13.11 shows the variation of power output with ambient temperature for both a clean and fouled compressor, respectively. The loss in gas turbine power at different ambient temperatures has also been shown. Simulating the compressor fouling discussed above at different ambient temperatures produced this figure. Note that the loss of power is most significant at lower ambient temperatures when the power output from the gas turbine is limited by speed rather than by the exhaust gas temperature. Furthermore, at high ambient temperatures, the compressor flow tends to be controlled by the HP stages of the compressor as the operating point moves down the compressor characteristic similar to that shown in Fig. 11.9 (lower compressor non-dimensional speed). However, fouling affects the LP stages of the compressor compared with the HP stages. Thus, the impact of fouling will be more important at low ambient temperatures. A very interesting discussion of the effects of compressor fouling at different compressor non-dimensional speeds is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 1

# 13.1.12 Displacement of running lines due to compressor fouling

The variation of non-dimensional parameters was discussed in Chapter 11, Section 11.1 and it was stated that the running lines are essentially an invariant of operating conditions (Figs 11.3 to 11.7). When engine performance deterioration takes place due to compressor fouling, these running lines change and the changes may be used to detect performance-related faults such as compressor fouling. Compressor fouling as stated earlier reduces the compressor non-dimensional flow and efficiency for a given non-dimensional speed.

These deteriorated compressor characteristics have been used to simulate the effect of compressor fouling on engine performance. The effect fouling has on these running lines can also be represented. Figure 13.12 shows the running line on the compressor characteristic for both a clean and a fouled compressor. The running line for the case when the compressor is fouled shows only a slight displacement towards surge, and is primarily due to the reduction of the compressor efficiency. The efficiency reduction is only 1% (compressor efficiency fault index), thus resulting in a small shift in the running line. Figure 13.12 also shows the operating points for the clean and fouled cases for the high-power operation cases just discussed.

The displacement of the running line on the compressor characteristic is only small, and, at lower power, the operating points for the two cases will be almost coincident; as will be demonstrated later. A better strategy is to

The shift in the running line is dependent only on the compressor fouling fault index, which represents the level of compressor fouling.

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

The reduction in compressor non-dimensional flow for a given compressor non-dimensional speed during compressor fouling not only shifts the running line on the compressor characteristic but the compressor pressure ratio will also decrease as the compressor fouls, as shown in Fig. 13.3. This effect is best illustrated by displaying the variation of the compressor pressure ratio with its non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 13.14, where the displacement in the running line is clearly shown. Unlike the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed, which is only influenced by compressor fouling, the variation of compressor pressure ratio will also be influenced by other engine faults, as will be seen later when damage to turbines is considered.

Similarly, the running lines based on other non-dimensional parameters may be produced. The user can generate these running lines with the respective operating points for a clean and fouled compressor.

The effect of fouling on engine performance will now be considered when the power demand from the generator is sufficiently low enough (17.5 MW) to prevent the engine from reaching an operating limit during compressor fouling.
