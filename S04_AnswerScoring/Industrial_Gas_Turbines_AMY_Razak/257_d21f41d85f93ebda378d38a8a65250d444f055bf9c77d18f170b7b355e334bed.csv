The small decrease in compressor air flow and approximately constant fuel flow results in a slight decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

# 16.4.6 Trends in pressure

The trends in pressure during this transient are shown in Figure 16.35. During the period after the gas turbine power limit is reached, the compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures decrease. This is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 16.30, in order to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.

# 16.4.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The trend in turbine creep life usage is similar to the case when the VIGV remains fully open, as discussed in Section 16.2.4. However, the turbine creep life usage is greater during the period of constant power output, as

# 16.4.6 Trends in pressure

The trends in pressure during this transient are shown in Figure 16.35. During the period after the gas turbine power limit is reached, the compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures decrease. This is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 16.30, in order to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.

# 16.4.6 Trends in pressure

The trends in pressure during this transient are shown in Figure 16.35. During the period after the gas turbine power limit is reached, the compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures decrease. This is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 16.30, in order to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.

# 16.4.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The trend in turbine creep life usage is similar to the case when the VIGV remains fully open, as discussed in Section 16.2.4. However, the turbine creep life usage is greater during the period of constant power output, as

The small decrease in compressor air flow and approximately constant fuel flow results in a slight decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

# 16.4.6 Trends in pressure

The trends in pressure during this transient are shown in Figure 16.35. During the period after the gas turbine power limit is reached, the compressor discharge and turbine inlet pressures decrease. This is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 16.30, in order to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.

This is due to the decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 16.30, in order to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine.

# 16.4.7 Trends in turbine creep life

The trend in turbine creep life usage is similar to the case when the VIGV remains fully open, as discussed in Section 16.2.4. However, the turbine creep life usage is greater during the period of constant power output, as
