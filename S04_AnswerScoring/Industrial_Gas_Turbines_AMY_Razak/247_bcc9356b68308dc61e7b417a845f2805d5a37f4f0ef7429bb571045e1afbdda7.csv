# 16.2.3 Trends in flow

The trends in air flow, fuel flow, fuel valve position and the air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 16.9. The air flow increases continuously due to the increase in compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, and the decrease in ambient temperature, T₁. The fuel flow increases during the period when the power output is controlled by the EGT. During this period, the power output from the gas turbine and its thermal efficiency increase.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency, thus the fuel flow increases to satisfy the increased power output. During the period when the gas turbine is power limited, the fuel flow decreases. This is because the thermal efficiency increases while the power output remains constant. The fuel valve position follows a similar trend to the fuel flow. The air–fuel ratio decreases during the period of constant EGT operation due to the combustor temperature rise, T₃ – T₁, during this period of operation (Fig. 16.8). Conversely, the air–fuel ratio increases during the period when the engine is power limited because of a decrease in combustor temperature.

# 16.2.3 Trends in flow

The trends in air flow, fuel flow, fuel valve position and the air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 16.9. The air flow increases continuously due to the increase in compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, and the decrease in ambient temperature, T₁. The fuel flow increases during the period when the power output is controlled by the EGT. During this period, the power output from the gas turbine and its thermal efficiency increase.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency, thus the fuel flow increases to satisfy the increased power output. During the period when the gas turbine is power limited, the fuel flow decreases. This is because the thermal efficiency increases while the power output remains constant. The fuel valve position follows a similar trend to the fuel flow. The air–fuel ratio decreases during the period of constant EGT operation due to the combustor temperature rise, T₃ – T₁, during this period of operation (Fig. 16.8). Conversely, the air–fuel ratio increases during the period when the engine is power limited because of a decrease in combustor temperature.

# 16.2.3 Trends in flow

The trends in air flow, fuel flow, fuel valve position and the air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 16.9. The air flow increases continuously due to the increase in compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, and the decrease in ambient temperature, T₁. The fuel flow increases during the period when the power output is controlled by the EGT. During this period, the power output from the gas turbine and its thermal efficiency increase.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency, thus the fuel flow increases to satisfy the increased power output. During the period when the gas turbine is power limited, the fuel flow decreases. This is because the thermal efficiency increases while the power output remains constant. The fuel valve position follows a similar trend to the fuel flow. The air–fuel ratio decreases during the period of constant EGT operation due to the combustor temperature rise, T₃ – T₁, during this period of operation (Fig. 16.8). Conversely, the air–fuel ratio increases during the period when the engine is power limited because of a decrease in combustor temperature.

# 16.2.3 Trends in flow

The trends in air flow, fuel flow, fuel valve position and the air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 16.9. The air flow increases continuously due to the increase in compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, and the decrease in ambient temperature, T₁. The fuel flow increases during the period when the power output is controlled by the EGT. During this period, the power output from the gas turbine and its thermal efficiency increase.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency, thus the fuel flow increases to satisfy the increased power output. During the period when the gas turbine is power limited, the fuel flow decreases. This is because the thermal efficiency increases while the power output remains constant. The fuel valve position follows a similar trend to the fuel flow. The air–fuel ratio decreases during the period of constant EGT operation due to the combustor temperature rise, T₃ – T₁, during this period of operation (Fig. 16.8). Conversely, the air–fuel ratio increases during the period when the engine is power limited because of a decrease in combustor temperature.

# 16.2.3 Trends in flow

The trends in air flow, fuel flow, fuel valve position and the air–fuel ratio are shown in Fig. 16.9. The air flow increases continuously due to the increase in compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, W₁√T₁/P₁, and the decrease in ambient temperature, T₁. The fuel flow increases during the period when the power output is controlled by the EGT. During this period, the power output from the gas turbine and its thermal efficiency increase.

However, the increase in power output is greater than the increase in thermal efficiency, thus the fuel flow increases to satisfy the increased power output. During the period when the gas turbine is power limited, the fuel flow decreases. This is because the thermal efficiency increases while the power output remains constant. The fuel valve position follows a similar trend to the fuel flow. The air–fuel ratio decreases during the period of constant EGT operation due to the combustor temperature rise, T₃ – T₁, during this period of operation (Fig. 16.8). Conversely, the air–fuel ratio increases during the period when the engine is power limited because of a decrease in combustor temperature.
