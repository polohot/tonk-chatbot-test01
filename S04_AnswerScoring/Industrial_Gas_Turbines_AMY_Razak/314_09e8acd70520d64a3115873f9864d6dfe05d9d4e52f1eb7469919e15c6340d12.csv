Determine the increase in exhaust gas temperature limit and the water–fuel ratio required in each case to achieve the increased power output from the gas turbine. Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

","Why does turbine creep life usage decrease with hot end damage, and what is the actual increase in turbine creep life usage due to this fault?",A4,Creep life usage drops as the fault leads to increased flow capacity and lower temperatures. The increase in creep life usage is specific to the scenario.,1.734375,2.171875,3.40625,1.6015625,0.376953125

The gas turbine has been operating for 80,000 hours and is due for its major overhaul. The compressor and turbine efficiencies have each reduced by 1%. There is also some residual compressor fouling reducing the compressor capacity by 1.5%. Determine the loss in performance.

15. Simulate the effect of hot end damage on the turbine where the flow capacity of the turbine is increased by 3% and the efficiency of the turbine is reduced by 1%. Determine the loss in power output and thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. Explain why the turbine creep life usage decreased and determine the actual increase in turbine creep life usage due to this fault.

16. A piece of the transition duct has been dislodged and adhered to the turbine nozzle guide vane, resulting in a reduction in the flow capacity of the turbine by 4%. This damage also results in a loss in the turbine efficiency by 1%. Determine the loss in performance of the gas turbine when the ambient temperature is 30 and –15 degrees Celsius. What limits the power output from the gas turbine at each of these ambient temperatures?
