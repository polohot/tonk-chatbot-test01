Now load the gas turbine by setting the power demand from the generator to 20 MW. Explain why the generator power demand cannot be met and what limits the power output. Ambient pressure and temperature are 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius.
","Why can the generator power demand of 20 MW not be met when a VSV fault is introduced, and what limits the power output?",A5,"The power output is limited and the 20 MW demand cannot be met because the VSV fault causes the compressor to foul, significantly reducing the gas turbine's efficiency and output capacity.",2.09375,2.28125,3.625,1.5,0.48828125
