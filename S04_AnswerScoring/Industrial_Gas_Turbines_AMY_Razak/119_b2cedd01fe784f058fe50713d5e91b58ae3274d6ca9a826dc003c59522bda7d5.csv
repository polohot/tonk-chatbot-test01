(5) difference between the estimated cooler exit temperature, T₃, and that calculated from the cooler effectiveness Equation 7.27:

ε = T2 - T3 / (T2 - Tc) [7.27]

where εcooler is the effectiveness of the cooler and Tc is the coolant inlet temperature normally equal to T1. It is assumed that the thermal capacity of the coolant is greater than that of the air being cooled, which would normally be the case.

Note: Required fuel flow can be specified rather than the required power output for the check vector (3), in which case the power output from the gas turbine will be calculated.
