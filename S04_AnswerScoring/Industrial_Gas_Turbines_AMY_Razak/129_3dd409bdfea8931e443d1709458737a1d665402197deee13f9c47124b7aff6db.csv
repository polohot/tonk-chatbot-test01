# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

W₄P T₄ = W₃P T₃ × P³ × T₄ × W₄ [8.3]

where

- W₃√T₃/P₃ is the non-dimensional flow at entry to the gas generator turbine
- P₃/P₄ is the gas generator turbine pressure ratio
- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

During power turbine choked conditions, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio and thus the non-dimensional temperature drop, ΔT₃₄/T₃, will be constant provided the generator turbine efficiency is also constant.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

W₄P T₄ = W₃P T₃ × P³ × T₄ × W₄ [8.3]

where

- W₃√T₃/P₃ is the non-dimensional flow at entry to the gas generator turbine
- P₃/P₄ is the gas generator turbine pressure ratio
- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

During power turbine choked conditions, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio and thus the non-dimensional temperature drop, ΔT₃₄/T₃, will be constant provided the generator turbine efficiency is also constant.

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

W₄P T₄ = W₃P T₃ × P³ × T₄ × W₄ [8.3]

- W₃√T₃/P₃ is the non-dimensional flow at entry to the gas generator turbine
- P₃/P₄ is the gas generator turbine pressure ratio
- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

During power turbine choked conditions, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio and thus the non-dimensional temperature drop, ΔT₃₄/T₃, will be constant provided the generator turbine efficiency is also constant.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

Referring to Fig. 8.6 and ignoring the gas properties terms, γ and R, the flow compatibility equation for turbines operating in series can be written as:

W₄P T₄ = W₃P T₃ × P³ × T₄ × W₄ [8.3]

where

- W₃√T₃/P₃ is the non-dimensional flow at entry to the gas generator turbine
- P₃/P₄ is the gas generator turbine pressure ratio
- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio
- W₃/W₄ is the ratio of gas flow at inlet of gas generator turbine to gas flow at inlet of power turbine
- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.

During power turbine choked conditions, the gas generator turbine pressure ratio and thus the non-dimensional temperature drop, ΔT₃₄/T₃, will be constant provided the generator turbine efficiency is also constant.

Thus, the operating point on the gas generator turbine characteristic is determined primarily by the swallowing capacity of the power turbine.

In this analysis, it has been assumed that the gas generator turbine efficiency remains constant for the three operating cases shown in Fig. 8.5 and this is usually the case. If there is a change in the gas generator turbine efficiency at these conditions, then the operating points (2) and (3) will not be coincident. However, this is usually small because of the small change in turbine efficiency with pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed.

- T₃/T₄ is the gas turbine temperature ratio

- W₄√T₄/P₄ is the power turbine inlet non-dimensional flow.
