# Introduction

In oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas wells deplete over time and affect production. The storage of CO2 in these depleted wells not only provides a means of storage but also increases the pressures in these wells, therefore enhancing production. The additional cost of carbon capture and storage can therefore be offset partly by the increased production of oil and gas.

# 1.5 Engine controls

The power output from the gas turbine is controlled primarily by the amount of fuel that is burnt in the combustion system. Excess or uncontrolled fuel addition results in overheating of the turbine and over-speeding, which can seriously damage the engine. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to prevent any engine operating limits from being exceeded. However, in the process it should not compromise the performance of the gas turbine. Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

The most common form of performance deterioration is compressor fouling and this manifests itself by the ingestion of dirt and dust from the environment. Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# 1.7 Gas turbine simulators

Much of what is said and discussed in this book can be elegantly illustrated by the use of a gas turbine simulator. The concept of component matching (the interaction of gas turbine components), which determines engine performance, and modelling of engine control systems as discussed in this book, has been used to build two industrial gas turbine simulators. These correspond to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine and a single-shaft gas turbine, respectively. Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.

Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

The most common form of performance deterioration is compressor fouling and this manifests itself by the ingestion of dirt and dust from the environment. Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# 1.7 Gas turbine simulators

Much of what is said and discussed in this book can be elegantly illustrated by the use of a gas turbine simulator. The concept of component matching (the interaction of gas turbine components), which determines engine performance, and modelling of engine control systems as discussed in this book, has been used to build two industrial gas turbine simulators. These correspond to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine and a single-shaft gas turbine, respectively. Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.

Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# 1.7 Gas turbine simulators

Much of what is said and discussed in this book can be elegantly illustrated by the use of a gas turbine simulator. The concept of component matching (the interaction of gas turbine components), which determines engine performance, and modelling of engine control systems as discussed in this book, has been used to build two industrial gas turbine simulators. These correspond to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine and a single-shaft gas turbine, respectively. Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.

# Introduction

In oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas wells deplete over time and affect production. The storage of CO2 in these depleted wells not only provides a means of storage but also increases the pressures in these wells, therefore enhancing production. The additional cost of carbon capture and storage can therefore be offset partly by the increased production of oil and gas.

# 1.5 Engine controls

The power output from the gas turbine is controlled primarily by the amount of fuel that is burnt in the combustion system. Excess or uncontrolled fuel addition results in overheating of the turbine and over-speeding, which can seriously damage the engine. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to prevent any engine operating limits from being exceeded. However, in the process it should not compromise the performance of the gas turbine. Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.

# Introduction

In oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas wells deplete over time and affect production. The storage of CO2 in these depleted wells not only provides a means of storage but also increases the pressures in these wells, therefore enhancing production. The additional cost of carbon capture and storage can therefore be offset partly by the increased production of oil and gas.

# 1.5 Engine controls

The power output from the gas turbine is controlled primarily by the amount of fuel that is burnt in the combustion system. Excess or uncontrolled fuel addition results in overheating of the turbine and over-speeding, which can seriously damage the engine. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to prevent any engine operating limits from being exceeded. However, in the process it should not compromise the performance of the gas turbine. Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

The most common form of performance deterioration is compressor fouling and this manifests itself by the ingestion of dirt and dust from the environment. Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# Introduction

In oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas wells deplete over time and affect production. The storage of CO2 in these depleted wells not only provides a means of storage but also increases the pressures in these wells, therefore enhancing production. The additional cost of carbon capture and storage can therefore be offset partly by the increased production of oil and gas.

# 1.5 Engine controls

The power output from the gas turbine is controlled primarily by the amount of fuel that is burnt in the combustion system. Excess or uncontrolled fuel addition results in overheating of the turbine and over-speeding, which can seriously damage the engine. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to prevent any engine operating limits from being exceeded. However, in the process it should not compromise the performance of the gas turbine. Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

The most common form of performance deterioration is compressor fouling and this manifests itself by the ingestion of dirt and dust from the environment. Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# 1.7 Gas turbine simulators

Much of what is said and discussed in this book can be elegantly illustrated by the use of a gas turbine simulator. The concept of component matching (the interaction of gas turbine components), which determines engine performance, and modelling of engine control systems as discussed in this book, has been used to build two industrial gas turbine simulators. These correspond to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine and a single-shaft gas turbine, respectively. Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.

# Introduction

In oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas wells deplete over time and affect production. The storage of CO2 in these depleted wells not only provides a means of storage but also increases the pressures in these wells, therefore enhancing production. The additional cost of carbon capture and storage can therefore be offset partly by the increased production of oil and gas.

# 1.5 Engine controls

The power output from the gas turbine is controlled primarily by the amount of fuel that is burnt in the combustion system. Excess or uncontrolled fuel addition results in overheating of the turbine and over-speeding, which can seriously damage the engine. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to prevent any engine operating limits from being exceeded. However, in the process it should not compromise the performance of the gas turbine. Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

The most common form of performance deterioration is compressor fouling and this manifests itself by the ingestion of dirt and dust from the environment. Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# 1.7 Gas turbine simulators

Much of what is said and discussed in this book can be elegantly illustrated by the use of a gas turbine simulator. The concept of component matching (the interaction of gas turbine components), which determines engine performance, and modelling of engine control systems as discussed in this book, has been used to build two industrial gas turbine simulators. These correspond to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine and a single-shaft gas turbine, respectively. Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.

The storage of CO2 in these depleted wells not only provides a means of storage but also increases the pressures in these wells, therefore enhancing production. The additional cost of carbon capture and storage can therefore be offset partly by the increased production of oil and gas.

# 1.5 Engine controls

The power output from the gas turbine is controlled primarily by the amount of fuel that is burnt in the combustion system. Excess or uncontrolled fuel addition results in overheating of the turbine and over-speeding, which can seriously damage the engine. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to prevent any engine operating limits from being exceeded. However, in the process it should not compromise the performance of the gas turbine. Control systems are quite complex, particularly in controlling DLE gas turbines, where the added requirements of maintaining air–fuel ratios within acceptable limits to maintain low emissions of NOx, CO and UHC now exist. These issues are discussed in some detail later in this book.

# 1.6 Performance deterioration

One area that has been of increased interest is gas turbine performance monitoring. This approach has received significant amounts of attention in the last three decades. All gas turbines deteriorate in performance during operation, leading to reduced capacity and thermal efficiency. Loss of capacity results in lost production, affecting revenue. Loss in thermal efficiency increases fuel consumption and therefore leads to higher fuel costs. Both these factors reduce profits. Performance deterioration generally results in increased emissions of NOx and CO2. If emissions are taxed, then a further increase in operating costs occurs due to performance deterioration, and is reflected in still higher life cycle costs.

The most common form of performance deterioration is compressor fouling and this manifests itself by the ingestion of dirt and dust from the environment. Compressor fouling results in reduced compressor capacity and efficiency, but regular washing of the engine should remedy this problem. Other causes of performance deterioration include increased clearance between rotor tips but the casings enclosing components such as compressors and turbines. Seals are also provided to prevent leakage from the high-pressure sections to the low-pressure sections. During usage, these clearances increase due to tip rubs, resulting in reduced performance of the gas turbine. Unlike compressor fouling, which can be mitigated by washing, an engine overhaul is required to return these increased clearances to their design condition.

# 1.7 Gas turbine simulators

Much of what is said and discussed in this book can be elegantly illustrated by the use of a gas turbine simulator. The concept of component matching (the interaction of gas turbine components), which determines engine performance, and modelling of engine control systems as discussed in this book, has been used to build two industrial gas turbine simulators. These correspond to a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine and a single-shaft gas turbine, respectively. Thus, these simulators now cover a majority of applications of industrial gas turbines.

The simulators are used extensively in the course of this book to illustrate the factors that affect engine performance, gas turbine emissions and engine life.

It is worth pointing out that such simulators are of paramount importance in the management of assets such as gas turbines. For example, these simulators may be used to understand changes in performance, emissions and life usage of the gas turbine due to changes in ambient conditions, deterioration and methods of power augmentation (e.g. peak rating, water injection and turbine inlet cooling where the inlet air is cooled by the evaporation of water or the use of chillers). Such information enables the user to obtain a deeper insight into gas turbine performance and operation, and information obtained by such means is sometimes referred to as knowledge management.
