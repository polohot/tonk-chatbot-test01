# 11.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

It was stated in Chapter 2 that it is the specific humidity which affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly NOₓ. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. Also observe that the variation in γ is small compared with cₚ and R.

For a given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity will increase the specific humidity, as can be seen from Fig. 2.16 in Chapter 2. During maximum power demand and operating at high ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). For a given ambient temperature, the ratio of exhaust gas temperature to compressor inlet temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, is fixed (note the change in γ is small as discussed above). From Fig. 11.6, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√(γR₁T₁) is also fixed, which in turn would fix the non-dimensional power output (see Fig. 11.7).

# 11.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

It was stated in Chapter 2 that it is the specific humidity which affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly NOₓ.

These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. Also observe that the variation in γ is small compared with cₚ and R.

# 11.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

It was stated in Chapter 2 that it is the specific humidity which affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly NOₓ. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. Also observe that the variation in γ is small compared with cₚ and R.

For a given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity will increase the specific humidity, as can be seen from Fig. 2.16 in Chapter 2. During maximum power demand and operating at high ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). For a given ambient temperature, the ratio of exhaust gas temperature to compressor inlet temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, is fixed (note the change in γ is small as discussed above). From Fig. 11.6, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√(γR₁T₁) is also fixed, which in turn would fix the non-dimensional power output (see Fig. 11.7).

During maximum power demand and operating at high ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). For a given ambient temperature, the ratio of exhaust gas temperature to compressor inlet temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, is fixed (note the change in γ is small as discussed above). From Fig. 11.6, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N₁/√(γR₁T₁) is also fixed, which in turn would fix the non-dimensional power output (see Fig. 11.7). ",Why is the ratio of exhaust gas temperature to compressor inlet temperature (T₄/T₁) fixed for a given ambient temperature?,A2,The minimal variation in γ ensures that T₄/T₁ remains fixed.,0.63671875,0.66015625,2.796875,1.125,0.060302734375

The figure also shows that CO increases during this transient. It has been discussed that CO formation is more sensitive to combustion temperature than combustion pressure, thus the decrease in combustion.

# 11.5 Effect of humidity on gas turbine performance and emissions

It was stated in Chapter 2 that it is the specific humidity which affects the performance of gas turbines. Also the effects of humidity on emissions have been discussed, particularly NOₓ. Increasing the specific humidity increases the gas constant, R, and specific heat at constant pressure, cₚ, while the ratio of specific heats, γ, decreases. These trends are shown in Fig. 11.30, which shows the variation of these gas properties with specific humidity. Also observe that the variation in γ is small compared with cₚ and R.

For a given ambient temperature and pressure, an increase in relative humidity will increase the specific humidity, as can be seen from Fig. 2.16 in Chapter 2. During maximum power demand and operating at high ambient temperatures, the power output of the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). For a given ambient temperature, the ratio of exhaust gas temperature to compressor inlet temperature, T₄(EGT)/T₁, is fixed (note the change in γ is small as discussed above).
