# 18.2.7 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

Since the level of compressor fouling in this case is the same as that applied to the high-power operating case, the shift in the running line is very similar. As operation is at the same compressor non-dimensional speed and the steepness of the compressor speed lines are the same, therefore, the operating points.

Since the level of compressor fouling in this case is the same as that applied to the high-power operating case, the shift in the running line is very similar. As operation is at the same compressor non-dimensional speed and the steepness of the compressor speed lines are the same, therefore, the operating points.

# 18.2.7 Displacement of running line due to compressor fouling

Since the level of compressor fouling in this case is the same as that applied to the high-power operating case, the shift in the running line is very similar. As operation is at the same compressor non-dimensional speed and the steepness of the compressor speed lines are the same, therefore, the operating points.
