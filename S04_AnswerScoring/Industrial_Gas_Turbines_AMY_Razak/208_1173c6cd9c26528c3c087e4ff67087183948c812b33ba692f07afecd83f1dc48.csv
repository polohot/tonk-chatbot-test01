The variation of gas turbine thermal efficiency with ambient temperature for a series of values of relative humidity, is shown in Fig. 11.32. At high ambient temperatures (30 degrees Celsius), the increase in gas turbine power output due to the increase in relative humidity (from 0% to 100%) can be about 1.5% and this increase in power increases with ambient temperature.

However, the increase in specific humidity reduces the thermal efficiency, due to the additional fuel required to heat the water vapour to the required turbine entry temperature. The variation of gas turbine thermal efficiency with ambient temperature for a series of values of relative humidity, is shown in Fig. 11.32. At high ambient temperatures (30 degrees Celsius), the increase in gas turbine power output due to the increase in relative humidity (from 0% to 100%) can be about 1.5% and this increase in power increases with ambient temperature. Thus, at high ambient temperature, an increase in humidity will result in a worthwhile increase in power output. Operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed, γ N₁/√( RT), an increase in the gas constant, R, due to the increase in specific humidity, will require an increase in the gas.
