# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

# 18.4.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase. To determine the true picture of the impact of hot end damage on these emissions, it is necessary to run the simulator at the reduced power available due to this performance deterioration, but when no hot end damage is present. It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

The reduction in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO₂ emission on a mass basis but, due to the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, an

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",How does CO₂ emission change due to hot end damage when operating at high power?,A1,CO₂ emission decreases on a mass basis but the emissions index increases due to lower thermal efficiency.,1.4765625,1.609375,3.46875,1.34375,0.314453125

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",How does CO₂ emission change due to hot end damage when operating at high power?,A5,"Reduced thermal efficiency from hot end damage causes the CO₂ emissions index to increase, though mass emissions fall.",1.9609375,2.078125,3.53125,1.6015625,0.427734375

# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",How does hot end damage affect the compressor pressure ratio at low power with active VIGV?,A5,A decrease in compressor pressure ratio occurs from hot end damage at low power with VIGV active.,1.5078125,1.671875,3.234375,1.125,0.0986328125

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",How does hot end damage affect turbine creep life usage when operating at high power?,A5,Reduced blade temperature and torque from hot end damage lead to less creep life usage.,0.51953125,0.60546875,3.25,0.83203125,0.1259765625

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

# 18.4.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase. To determine the true picture of the impact of hot end damage on these emissions, it is necessary to run the simulator at the reduced power available due to this performance deterioration, but when no hot end damage is present. It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

The reduction in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO₂ emission on a mass basis but, due to the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, an

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4.

# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

# 18.4.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase. To determine the true picture of the impact of hot end damage on these emissions, it is necessary to run the simulator at the reduced power available due to this performance deterioration, but when no hot end damage is present. It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

The reduction in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO₂ emission on a mass basis but, due to the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, an

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What causes the air–fuel ratio to increase during the simulation of hot end damage?,A5,"Fuel flow reduction, with combustion air flow unchanged, results in an increased air–fuel ratio.",2.25,2.53125,3.671875,1.359375,0.1806640625

# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase. To determine the true picture of the impact of hot end damage on these emissions, it is necessary to run the simulator at the reduced power available due to this performance deterioration, but when no hot end damage is present. It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

The reduction in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO₂ emission on a mass basis but, due to the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, an

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened.

This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation?,A4,"At low power, hot end damage with active VIGV leads to increased EGT and turbine entry temperature, reducing compressor pressure ratio.",1.5390625,1.6015625,3.265625,1.4296875,0.279296875

# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

18.33 Turbine creep life usage due to hot end damage and operating at high power.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What is the significance of running the simulator at reduced power to assess hot end damage?,A4,"To understand hot end damage's real effects, the simulator must be run at the engine's reduced power output.",1.46875,1.546875,3.140625,1.1953125,0.333984375

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",What trends in emissions are observed due to hot end damage at high power?,A4,Lower combustion pressure and temperature from hot end damage result in less NOₓ and more CO emissions.,2.21875,2.03125,3.453125,1.203125,0.3046875

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage.

Trends in flow, air-to-fuel ratio and fuel valve position due to the effect of hot end damage.

# 18.4.6 Trends in turbine creep life

During the simulation of hot end damage when operating at high power, a decrease in the turbine blade metal temperature is observed, as shown in Fig. 18.31. It is also observed that the turbine power decreases (Fig. 18.29), which results in a decrease in the turbine blade torque, hence reducing stress in the turbine blade material. These two factors reduce the turbine creep life usage as shown in Fig. 18.33. It must again be pointed out that the power output has also reduced. Thus it is only when the simulator is run at this reduced maximum power and when no performance deterioration is present that an increase in creep life usage is seen in real terms due to hot end damage. This is left as a simulation exercise for the reader to demonstrate the actual creep life usage due to hot end damage.

# 18.4.7 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The decrease in combustion pressure (Fig. 18.30) and temperature (Fig. 18.31) result in a decrease in NOₓ emissions, while CO emissions increase. To determine the true picture of the impact of hot end damage on these emissions, it is necessary to run the simulator at the reduced power available due to this performance deterioration, but when no hot end damage is present. It is then that an increase in NO x emissions will be observed in real terms.

The reduction in fuel flow results in the decrease in CO₂ emission on a mass basis but, due to the decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency, an

18.33 Turbine creep life usage due to hot end damage and operating at high power.

An increase in the CO₂ emissions index is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 18.34. This shows the trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power. Thus, in real terms, there is an increase in CO₂ emissions due to hot end damage.

# 18.5 Hot end damage at low power with active VIGV operation

The effect of hot end damage on the engine performance has been discussed when operating at high power and the reader left to simulate the case when operating at low power, when the VIGV remains fully opened. The impact of hot end damage at low operating power (e.g. 35 MW) with the VIGV fully opened is an increase in the EGT so that the power demand can be maintained. This results in an increase in turbine entry temperature, and thus an increase in T₃/T₁, but a decrease in compressor pressure ratio.

The impact of hot end damage is now investigated when the VIGV is active to maintain the EGT on its set point (maximum EGT limit) during the normal operating power range. The method of implementation of hot end damage using the simulator and the ambient conditions are the same as those discussed in Section 18.4. Thus the trends in the fault indices are the same as those shown in Fig. ",Why does turbine power decrease during the simulation of hot end damage at high power?,A4,Power output drops as hot end damage reduces turbine blade torque and stress.,1.3203125,1.515625,3.125,1.2109375,0.1455078125

The fuel valve position follows the fuel flow trend and therefore shows a decrease in the fuel valve position during this simulation.
