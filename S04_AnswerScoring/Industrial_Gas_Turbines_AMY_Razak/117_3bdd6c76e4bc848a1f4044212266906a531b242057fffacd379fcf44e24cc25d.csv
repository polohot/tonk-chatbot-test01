A three-shaft gas turbine is essentially a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine where the power turbine drives a booster compressor and the load. Thus the booster compressor now becomes the LP compressor and the LP compressor and turbine becomes the intermediate (IP) compressor and IP turbine, respectively.

(5) comparison between the power output from the gas turbine and the power required.

The two-shaft gas turbine has five estimated vectors and check vectors.

Note: Instead of the power output check (5), HP spool speed or non-dimensional speed, LP or the HP compressor pressure ratio or fuel flow can be used.

# 7.7 Off-design performance prediction of a three-shaft gas turbine

A three-shaft gas turbine is essentially a three-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine where the power turbine drives a booster compressor and the load. Thus the booster compressor now becomes the LP compressor and the LP compressor and turbine becomes the intermediate (IP) compressor and IP turbine, respectively. This is illustrated in Fig. ",What components are illustrated in the schematic representation of a two-shaft gas turbine in 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A5,"The book's schematic displays the combustor, load, LP turbine, along with LP and HP compressors and turbines.",2.65625,2.96875,3.796875,1.3671875,0.50390625
