Wetted media and chillers may be positioned either upstream or downstream of the gas turbine inlet filter/plenum. If they are positioned upstream of the inlet system, the filters have to be made of synthetic material. If paper filters were to be employed, the cool high humidity air would cause these filters to swell and become damaged.
