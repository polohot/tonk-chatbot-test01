combustion efficiency is 100%). For a given theoretical fuel–air ratio and combustion inlet temperature, the combustion temperature rise can be readily determined. If the combustion airflow is known, the theoretical heat input is calculated by  mc × f/a × LHV, where  mc is the combustion air mass flow, f/a is the theoretical fuel–air ratio and LHV is the lower heating value of the fuel. For kerosene, the LHV corresponds to about 43 MJ/kg. Similarly, if the combustion temperature rise and inlet temperature are given, the theoretical fuel–air ratio can be determined.

The actual fuel–air ratios and hence the actual heat input is determined using the equation:

In addition, the exit temperature of the gas from the heat exchanger is equal to the compressor discharge temperature. In practice, these limiting temperatures are never reached due to the imperfections of the heat exchanger.

In Section 2.7 the design point performance of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle was discussed. A perfect heat exchanger results in the air exit temperature from the heat exchanger being equal to the turbine exit temperature. In addition, the exit temperature of the gas from the heat exchanger is equal to the compressor discharge temperature. In practice, these limiting temperatures are never reached due to the imperfections of the heat exchanger.

An effectiveness parameter is used to determine the actual temperatures at exit from the heat exchanger and it is defined as:

- Tain is the heat exchanger inlet temperature (which is also the compressor discharge temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tgin is the heat exchanger gas inlet temperature (which is also the turbine exit temperature) (K or Celsius).

The gas temperature at exit from the heat exchanger is calculated from the energy balance according to the first law of thermodynamics and is given by:

If the combustion airflow is known, the theoretical heat input is calculated by  mc × f/a × LHV, where  mc is the combustion air mass flow, f/a is the theoretical fuel–air ratio and LHV is the lower heating value of the fuel. For kerosene, the LHV corresponds to about 43 MJ/kg. Similarly, if the combustion temperature rise and inlet temperature are given, the theoretical fuel–air ratio can be determined.

The actual fuel–air ratios and hence the actual heat input is determined using the equation:

theoretical  /

ηb =    actual  / fa for a given ΔT                         [2.61]

# 2.14 Heat exchanger performance

In Section 2.7 the design point performance of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle was discussed. A perfect heat exchanger results in the air exit temperature from the heat exchanger being equal to the turbine exit temperature. In addition, the exit temperature of the gas from the heat exchanger is equal to the compressor discharge temperature. In practice, these limiting temperatures are never reached due to the imperfections of the heat exchanger.

An effectiveness parameter is used to determine the actual temperatures at exit from the heat exchanger and it is defined as:

Taout   –

ε =  Tain                                             [2.62]

- ε is the heat exchanger effectiveness
- Taout is the air temperature at exit from the heat exchanger (and will become the combustor inlet temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tain is the heat exchanger inlet temperature (which is also the compressor discharge temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tgin is the heat exchanger gas inlet temperature (which is also the turbine exit temperature) (K or Celsius).

The gas temperature at exit from the heat exchanger is calculated from the energy balance according to the first law of thermodynamics and is given by:

Tgout  = Tgin  – ma × cp am  Ta (  Tout   –          )      [2.63]

2.17 Combustion temperature rise versus fuel–air ratio.

# 40 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

combustion efficiency is 100%). For a given theoretical fuel–air ratio and combustion inlet temperature, the combustion temperature rise can be readily determined. If the combustion airflow is known, the theoretical heat input is calculated by  mc × f/a × LHV, where  mc is the combustion air mass flow, f/a is the theoretical fuel–air ratio and LHV is the lower heating value of the fuel. For kerosene, the LHV corresponds to about 43 MJ/kg. Similarly, if the combustion temperature rise and inlet temperature are given, the theoretical fuel–air ratio can be determined.

The actual fuel–air ratios and hence the actual heat input is determined using the equation:

theoretical  /

ηb =    actual  / fa for a given ΔT                         [2.61]

where ΔT is the combustion temperature rise and ηb is the combustion efficiency.

# 2.14 Heat exchanger performance

In Section 2.7 the design point performance of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle was discussed. A perfect heat exchanger results in the air exit temperature from the heat exchanger being equal to the turbine exit temperature. In addition, the exit temperature of the gas from the heat exchanger is equal to the compressor discharge temperature. In practice, these limiting temperatures are never reached due to the imperfections of the heat exchanger.

An effectiveness parameter is used to determine the actual temperatures at exit from the heat exchanger and it is defined as:

- Tain is the heat exchanger inlet temperature (which is also the compressor discharge temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tgin is the heat exchanger gas inlet temperature (which is also the turbine exit temperature) (K or Celsius).

The gas temperature at exit from the heat exchanger is calculated from the energy balance according to the first law of thermodynamics and is given by:

# 40 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

combustion efficiency is 100%). For a given theoretical fuel–air ratio and combustion inlet temperature, the combustion temperature rise can be readily determined. If the combustion airflow is known, the theoretical heat input is calculated by  mc × f/a × LHV, where  mc is the combustion air mass flow, f/a is the theoretical fuel–air ratio and LHV is the lower heating value of the fuel. For kerosene, the LHV corresponds to about 43 MJ/kg. Similarly, if the combustion temperature rise and inlet temperature are given, the theoretical fuel–air ratio can be determined.

The actual fuel–air ratios and hence the actual heat input is determined using the equation:

# 2.14 Heat exchanger performance

In Section 2.7 the design point performance of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle was discussed. A perfect heat exchanger results in the air exit temperature from the heat exchanger being equal to the turbine exit temperature. In addition, the exit temperature of the gas from the heat exchanger is equal to the compressor discharge temperature. In practice, these limiting temperatures are never reached due to the imperfections of the heat exchanger.

An effectiveness parameter is used to determine the actual temperatures at exit from the heat exchanger and it is defined as:

- Tain is the heat exchanger inlet temperature (which is also the compressor discharge temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tgin is the heat exchanger gas inlet temperature (which is also the turbine exit temperature) (K or Celsius).

The gas temperature at exit from the heat exchanger is calculated from the energy balance according to the first law of thermodynamics and is given by:

# 40 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

combustion efficiency is 100%). For a given theoretical fuel–air ratio and combustion inlet temperature, the combustion temperature rise can be readily determined. If the combustion airflow is known, the theoretical heat input is calculated by  mc × f/a × LHV, where  mc is the combustion air mass flow, f/a is the theoretical fuel–air ratio and LHV is the lower heating value of the fuel. For kerosene, the LHV corresponds to about 43 MJ/kg. Similarly, if the combustion temperature rise and inlet temperature are given, the theoretical fuel–air ratio can be determined.

The actual fuel–air ratios and hence the actual heat input is determined using the equation:

theoretical  /

ηb =    actual  / fa for a given ΔT                         [2.61]

where ΔT is the combustion temperature rise and ηb is the combustion efficiency.

# 2.14 Heat exchanger performance

In Section 2.7 the design point performance of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle was discussed. A perfect heat exchanger results in the air exit temperature from the heat exchanger being equal to the turbine exit temperature. In addition, the exit temperature of the gas from the heat exchanger is equal to the compressor discharge temperature. In practice, these limiting temperatures are never reached due to the imperfections of the heat exchanger.

An effectiveness parameter is used to determine the actual temperatures at exit from the heat exchanger and it is defined as:

Taout   –

ε =  Tain                                             [2.62]

Tgin   – Tain

where

- ε is the heat exchanger effectiveness
- Taout is the air temperature at exit from the heat exchanger (and will become the combustor inlet temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tain is the heat exchanger inlet temperature (which is also the compressor discharge temperature) (K or Celsius)
- Tgin is the heat exchanger gas inlet temperature (which is also the turbine exit temperature) (K or Celsius).

The gas temperature at exit from the heat exchanger is calculated from the energy balance according to the first law of thermodynamics and is given by:

Tgout  = Tgin  – ma × cp am  Ta (  Tout   –          )      [2.63]
