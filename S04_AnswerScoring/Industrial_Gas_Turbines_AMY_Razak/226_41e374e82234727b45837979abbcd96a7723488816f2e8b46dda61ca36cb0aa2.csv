Increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection at unity during the change in the ambient temperature range. At high ambient temperatures, a significant increase in power output is achieved by water injection. The gas turbine power output increases by about 6% and 7% above the base rating for ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. As the ambient temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius, the power output starts to flatten out and is due to the gas generator speed reaching its operating limit (continuous rating limit), which now occurs at a higher ambient temperature compared with the base-rated base.

At zero degrees Celsius, the power increase due to water injection is only about 1%. At such low ambient temperatures, the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine. Direct water injection into the combustor would increase the mass flow rate through the gas generator turbine, thus increasing the power output of the gas generator turbine and this would increase the gas generator speed as observed at high ambient temperatures when the exhaust gas temperature limits the power output of the gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, when the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits the performance of the gas turbine, a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃, is necessary to maintain the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine. The reduction in turbine entry temperature reduces the specific work, while water injection increases the gas generator turbine power output. The net effect is a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures due to water injection when speeds limit the power output of the gas turbine.

The effect of water injection on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is shown in Fig. 14.15. Water injection results in a reduction in thermal efficiency.

Increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection at unity during the change in the ambient temperature range. At high ambient temperatures, a significant increase in power output is achieved by water injection. The gas turbine power output increases by about 6% and 7% above the base rating for ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. As the ambient temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius, the power output starts to flatten out and is due to the gas generator speed reaching its operating limit (continuous rating limit), which now occurs at a higher ambient temperature compared with the base-rated base.

At zero degrees Celsius, the power increase due to water injection is only about 1%. At such low ambient temperatures, the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine. Direct water injection into the combustor would increase the mass flow rate through the gas generator turbine, thus increasing the power output of the gas generator turbine and this would increase the gas generator speed as observed at high ambient temperatures when the exhaust gas temperature limits the power output of the gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, when the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits the performance of the gas turbine, a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃, is necessary to maintain the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine.

The gas turbine power output increases by about 6% and 7% above the base rating for ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. As the ambient temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius, the power output starts to flatten out and is due to the gas generator speed reaching its operating limit (continuous rating limit), which now occurs at a higher ambient temperature compared with the base-rated base.

At zero degrees Celsius, the power increase due to water injection is only about 1%. At such low ambient temperatures, the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine. Direct water injection into the combustor would increase the mass flow rate through the gas generator turbine, thus increasing the power output of the gas generator turbine and this would increase the gas generator speed as observed at high ambient temperatures when the exhaust gas temperature limits the power output of the gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, when the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits the performance of the gas turbine, a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃, is necessary to maintain the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine. The reduction in turbine entry temperature reduces the specific work, while water injection increases the gas generator turbine power output. The net effect is a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures due to water injection when speeds limit the power output of the gas turbine.

The effect of water injection on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is shown in Fig. 14.15. Water injection results in a reduction in thermal efficiency.

Increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection at unity during the change in the ambient temperature range. At high ambient temperatures, a significant increase in power output is achieved by water injection. The gas turbine power output increases by about 6% and 7% above the base rating for ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. As the ambient temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius, the power output starts to flatten out and is due to the gas generator speed reaching its operating limit (continuous rating limit), which now occurs at a higher ambient temperature compared with the base-rated base.

At zero degrees Celsius, the power increase due to water injection is only about 1%. At such low ambient temperatures, the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine. Direct water injection into the combustor would increase the mass flow rate through the gas generator turbine, thus increasing the power output of the gas generator turbine and this would increase the gas generator speed as observed at high ambient temperatures when the exhaust gas temperature limits the power output of the gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, when the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits the performance of the gas turbine, a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃, is necessary to maintain the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine. The reduction in turbine entry temperature reduces the specific work, while water injection increases the gas generator turbine power output. The net effect is a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures due to water injection when speeds limit the power output of the gas turbine.

The effect of water injection on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is shown in Fig. 14.15. Water injection results in a reduction in thermal efficiency.

At low ambient temperatures, when the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits the performance of the gas turbine, a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃, is necessary to maintain the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine. The reduction in turbine entry temperature reduces the specific work, while water injection increases the gas generator turbine power output. The net effect is a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures due to water injection when speeds limit the power output of the gas turbine.

The effect of water injection on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is shown in Fig. 14.15. Water injection results in a reduction in thermal efficiency.

Increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection at unity during the change in the ambient temperature range. At high ambient temperatures, a significant increase in power output is achieved by water injection. The gas turbine power output increases by about 6% and 7% above the base rating for ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. As the ambient temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius, the power output starts to flatten out and is due to the gas generator speed reaching its operating limit (continuous rating limit), which now occurs at a higher ambient temperature compared with the base-rated base.

Increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection at unity during the change in the ambient temperature range. At high ambient temperatures, a significant increase in power output is achieved by water injection. The gas turbine power output increases by about 6% and 7% above the base rating for ambient temperatures of 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. As the ambient temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius, the power output starts to flatten out and is due to the gas generator speed reaching its operating limit (continuous rating limit), which now occurs at a higher ambient temperature compared with the base-rated base.

At zero degrees Celsius, the power increase due to water injection is only about 1%. At such low ambient temperatures, the gas generator speed limits the power output of the gas turbine. Direct water injection into the combustor would increase the mass flow rate through the gas generator turbine, thus increasing the power output of the gas generator turbine and this would increase the gas generator speed as observed at high ambient temperatures when the exhaust gas temperature limits the power output of the gas turbine.

At low ambient temperatures, when the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits the performance of the gas turbine, a decrease in turbine entry temperature, T₃, is necessary to maintain the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine. The reduction in turbine entry temperature reduces the specific work, while water injection increases the gas generator turbine power output. The net effect is a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures due to water injection when speeds limit the power output of the gas turbine.

The effect of water injection on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is shown in Fig. 14.15. Water injection results in a reduction in thermal efficiency.
