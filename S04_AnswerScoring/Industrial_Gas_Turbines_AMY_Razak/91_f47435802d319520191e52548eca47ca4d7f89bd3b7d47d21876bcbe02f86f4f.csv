# 6.5 Fuel injection and atomisation

For satisfactory combustion of liquid fuel, such as kerosene, sufficient quantities of fuel vapour must be produced to sustain the combustion process in gas turbines. The production of fuel vapour in necessary quantities starts with the atomisation of the fuel, where a large number of fine droplets are produced. However, the droplets are still liquid and have to be evaporated and heated to the ignition temperature. The droplet temperature increases until it reaches the fuel boiling point and then remains constant due to the absorption of latent heat required by the evaporation process. Clearly, the rate of evaporation depends on many factors such as the droplet size, combustion air pressure and temperature, and the specific heat of the fuel. Poor atomisation can lead to reduced combustion efficiency and the formation of pollutants such as CO and UHC.

The production of fuel vapour in necessary quantities starts with the atomisation of the fuel, where a large number of fine droplets are produced. However, the droplets are still liquid and have to be evaporated and heated to the ignition temperature. The droplet temperature increases until it reaches the fuel boiling point and then remains constant due to the absorption of latent heat required by the evaporation process. Clearly, the rate of evaporation depends on many factors such as the droplet size, combustion air pressure and temperature, and the specific heat of the fuel. Poor atomisation can lead to reduced combustion efficiency and the formation of pollutants such as CO and UHC.

# 6.5 Fuel injection and atomisation

For satisfactory combustion of liquid fuel, such as kerosene, sufficient quantities of fuel vapour must be produced to sustain the combustion process in gas turbines. The production of fuel vapour in necessary quantities starts with the atomisation of the fuel, where a large number of fine droplets are produced. However, the droplets are still liquid and have to be evaporated and heated to the ignition temperature. The droplet temperature increases until it reaches the fuel boiling point and then remains constant due to the absorption of latent heat required by the evaporation process. Clearly, the rate of evaporation depends on many factors such as the droplet size, combustion air pressure and temperature, and the specific heat of the fuel. Poor atomisation can lead to reduced combustion efficiency and the formation of pollutants such as CO and UHC.

# 6.5 Fuel injection and atomisation

For satisfactory combustion of liquid fuel, such as kerosene, sufficient quantities of fuel vapour must be produced to sustain the combustion process in gas turbines. The production of fuel vapour in necessary quantities starts with the atomisation of the fuel, where a large number of fine droplets are produced. However, the droplets are still liquid and have to be evaporated and heated to the ignition temperature. The droplet temperature increases until it reaches the fuel boiling point and then remains constant due to the absorption of latent heat required by the evaporation process. Clearly, the rate of evaporation depends on many factors such as the droplet size, combustion air pressure and temperature, and the specific heat of the fuel. Poor atomisation can lead to reduced combustion efficiency and the formation of pollutants such as CO and UHC.

# 6.5.1 Pressure swirl atomisers

Liquid fuels, as stated, require atomisation before combustion. Fuel under pressure is forced through an orifice to form a thin conical sheet of fuel. This
