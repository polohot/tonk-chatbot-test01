The increase in boundary layer thickness results in the flow spilling into the adjacent blades, as shown in Fig. 4.15, where the flow into channel B has stalled. This reduces the incidence into channel C and increases the incidence into channel A, forcing channel A to stall. This process continues causing the stalled channel, or cell as it is commonly known, to rotate in a direction opposite to that of the blade. The efficiency loss during rotating stall is not sufficient for flow reversal but is often a precursor to surge. Axial compressors can operate with many of their stages stalled, particularly at low operating speeds.

# 4.8 Compressor surge

Compressor surge is a rather complex phenomenon but is associated with the stalling of the compressor blades due to high positive incidence. The following is a simplified explanation of surge.

The amount of diffusion has to be controlled and an excessive amount of diffusion will cause the flow to separate from the blade contours, resulting in stalling. Stalling gives rise to a significant loss in efficiency due to high profile losses, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.8 Compressor surge

Compressor surge is a rather complex phenomenon but is associated with the stalling of the compressor blades due to high positive incidence. The following is a simplified explanation of surge.

The amount of diffusion has to be controlled and an excessive amount of diffusion will cause the flow to separate from the blade contours, resulting in stalling. Stalling gives rise to a significant loss in efficiency due to high profile losses, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

The increase in boundary layer thickness results in the flow spilling into the adjacent blades, as shown in Fig. 4.15, where the flow into channel B has stalled. This reduces the incidence into channel C and increases the incidence into channel A, forcing channel A to stall. This process continues causing the stalled channel, or cell as it is commonly known, to rotate in a direction opposite to that of the blade. The efficiency loss during rotating stall is not sufficient for flow reversal but is often a precursor to surge. Axial compressors can operate with many of their stages stalled, particularly at low operating speeds.

The increase in boundary layer thickness results in the flow spilling into the adjacent blades, as shown in Fig. 4.15, where the flow into channel B has stalled. This reduces the incidence into channel C and increases the incidence into channel A, forcing channel A to stall. This process continues causing the stalled channel, or cell as it is commonly known, to rotate in a direction opposite to that of the blade. The efficiency loss during rotating stall is not sufficient for flow reversal but is often a precursor to surge. Axial compressors can operate with many of their stages stalled, particularly at low operating speeds.

# 4.8 Compressor surge

Compressor surge is a rather complex phenomenon but is associated with the stalling of the compressor blades due to high positive incidence. The following is a simplified explanation of surge.

The amount of diffusion has to be controlled and an excessive amount of diffusion will cause the flow to separate from the blade contours, resulting in stalling. Stalling gives rise to a significant loss in efficiency due to high profile losses, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

The increase in boundary layer thickness results in the flow spilling into the adjacent blades, as shown in Fig. 4.15, where the flow into channel B has stalled. This reduces the incidence into channel C and increases the incidence into channel A, forcing channel A to stall. This process continues causing the stalled channel, or cell as it is commonly known, to rotate in a direction opposite to that of the blade. The efficiency loss during rotating stall is not sufficient for flow reversal but is often a precursor to surge. Axial compressors can operate with many of their stages stalled, particularly at low operating speeds.

# 4.8 Compressor surge

Compressor surge is a rather complex phenomenon but is associated with the stalling of the compressor blades due to high positive incidence. The following is a simplified explanation of surge.

The amount of diffusion has to be controlled and an excessive amount of diffusion will cause the flow to separate from the blade contours, resulting in stalling. Stalling gives rise to a significant loss in efficiency due to high profile losses, as shown in Fig. 4.11.
