# 9 Gas turbine performance deterioration

Earlier chapters described the matching of engine component characteristics, namely compressors, combustors and turbines in determining gas turbine performance. In fact, it is the interaction of engine components that determines engine parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds and power outputs. Any engine performance deterioration results from a change in the component characteristic of the deteriorated components. The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

The following conditions are typical causes of gas turbine performance deterioration:

- fouling
- variable inlet guide vane and variable stator vane problems

|Component performance deterioration|Results in change in component characteristics|deteriorated characteristics results in|
|---|---|---|
| |a change in measurable parameters|and a loss in power and thermal efficiency|

- seal wear and damage
- foreign object damage (FOD) and domestic object damage (DOD)

A good general discussion on the causes and consequences of component performance deterioration on overall engine performance is given in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

# 9.1 Compressor fouling

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris. Filtration can only arrest fouling but cannot prevent it. Compressor fouling affects both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, but the effect on flow capacity is usually greater. The effect of fouling on the possible change in the compressor blade profile is shown in Fig. 9.2. The build-up of deposits will reduce the flow area, thus reducing the flow coefficient, and the change in blade profile will increase the tendency for the flow to separate, reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

The change in the compressor flow characteristic due to fouling is shown in Fig. 9.3 where the lines of constant non-dimensional speeds are shifted to the left, thus reducing the flow capacity of the compressor. Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

Build-up of deposits due to fouling increases the tendency for the flow to separate at the trailing edge.

# 9.1 Compressor fouling

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris. Filtration can only arrest fouling but cannot prevent it. Compressor fouling affects both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, but the effect on flow capacity is usually greater. The effect of fouling on the possible change in the compressor blade profile is shown in Fig. 9.2. The build-up of deposits will reduce the flow area, thus reducing the flow coefficient, and the change in blade profile will increase the tendency for the flow to separate, reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

The change in the compressor flow characteristic due to fouling is shown in Fig. 9.3 where the lines of constant non-dimensional speeds are shifted to the left, thus reducing the flow capacity of the compressor. Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

Build-up of deposits due to fouling increases the tendency for the flow to separate at the trailing edge.

# 9 Gas turbine performance deterioration

Earlier chapters described the matching of engine component characteristics, namely compressors, combustors and turbines in determining gas turbine performance. In fact, it is the interaction of engine components that determines engine parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds and power outputs. Any engine performance deterioration results from a change in the component characteristic of the deteriorated components. The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

The following conditions are typical causes of gas turbine performance deterioration:

# 9 Gas turbine performance deterioration

Earlier chapters described the matching of engine component characteristics, namely compressors, combustors and turbines in determining gas turbine performance. In fact, it is the interaction of engine components that determines engine parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds and power outputs. Any engine performance deterioration results from a change in the component characteristic of the deteriorated components. The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

The following conditions are typical causes of gas turbine performance deterioration:

- fouling
- variable inlet guide vane and variable stator vane problems

|Component performance deterioration|Results in change in component characteristics|deteriorated characteristics results in|

# 9.1 Compressor fouling

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris. Filtration can only arrest fouling but cannot prevent it. Compressor fouling affects both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, but the effect on flow capacity is usually greater. The effect of fouling on the possible change in the compressor blade profile is shown in Fig. 9.2. The build-up of deposits will reduce the flow area, thus reducing the flow coefficient, and the change in blade profile will increase the tendency for the flow to separate, reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

The change in the compressor flow characteristic due to fouling is shown in Fig. 9.3 where the lines of constant non-dimensional speeds are shifted to the left, thus reducing the flow capacity of the compressor. Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

Build-up of deposits due to fouling increases the tendency for the flow to separate at the trailing edge.

The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

# 9.1 Compressor fouling

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris. Filtration can only arrest fouling but cannot prevent it. Compressor fouling affects both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, but the effect on flow capacity is usually greater. The effect of fouling on the possible change in the compressor blade profile is shown in Fig. 9.2. The build-up of deposits will reduce the flow area, thus reducing the flow coefficient, and the change in blade profile will increase the tendency for the flow to separate, reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

The change in the compressor flow characteristic due to fouling is shown in Fig. 9.3 where the lines of constant non-dimensional speeds are shifted to the left, thus reducing the flow capacity of the compressor. Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

Build-up of deposits due to fouling increases the tendency for the flow to separate at the trailing edge.

Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

# 9 Gas turbine performance deterioration

Earlier chapters described the matching of engine component characteristics, namely compressors, combustors and turbines in determining gas turbine performance. In fact, it is the interaction of engine components that determines engine parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds and power outputs. Any engine performance deterioration results from a change in the component characteristic of the deteriorated components. The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

The following conditions are typical causes of gas turbine performance deterioration:

- fouling
- variable inlet guide vane and variable stator vane problems

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris.

# 9 Gas turbine performance deterioration

Earlier chapters described the matching of engine component characteristics, namely compressors, combustors and turbines in determining gas turbine performance. In fact, it is the interaction of engine components that determines engine parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds and power outputs. Any engine performance deterioration results from a change in the component characteristic of the deteriorated components. The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

The following conditions are typical causes of gas turbine performance deterioration:

- fouling
- variable inlet guide vane and variable stator vane problems

|Component performance deterioration|Results in change in component characteristics|deteriorated characteristics results in|
|---|---|---|
| |a change in measurable parameters|and a loss in power and thermal efficiency|

A good general discussion on the causes and consequences of component performance deterioration on overall engine performance is given in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

# 9.1 Compressor fouling

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris. Filtration can only arrest fouling but cannot prevent it. Compressor fouling affects both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, but the effect on flow capacity is usually greater. The effect of fouling on the possible change in the compressor blade profile is shown in Fig. 9.2. The build-up of deposits will reduce the flow area, thus reducing the flow coefficient, and the change in blade profile will increase the tendency for the flow to separate, reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

The change in the compressor flow characteristic due to fouling is shown in Fig. 9.3 where the lines of constant non-dimensional speeds are shifted to the left, thus reducing the flow capacity of the compressor. Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

Build-up of deposits due to fouling increases the tendency for the flow to separate at the trailing edge.

# 9.1 Compressor fouling

Compressor fouling is probably the most common cause of performance deterioration. Compressor fouling results from the ingestion of dirt, dust, pollen, sap and general airborne debris. Filtration can only arrest fouling but cannot prevent it. Compressor fouling affects both compressor flow capacity and efficiency, but the effect on flow capacity is usually greater. The effect of fouling on the possible change in the compressor blade profile is shown in Fig. 9.2. The build-up of deposits will reduce the flow area, thus reducing the flow coefficient, and the change in blade profile will increase the tendency for the flow to separate, reducing the efficiency of the compressor.

The change in the compressor flow characteristic due to fouling is shown in Fig. 9.3 where the lines of constant non-dimensional speeds are shifted to the left, thus reducing the flow capacity of the compressor. Figure 9.4 shows the impact of fouling on compressor efficiency. Compressor fouling affects all stages; however, the biggest impact is on the front stages of the compressor. At normal operating speeds (high speeds), the compressor flow is controlled by the front stages of the compressor, thus fouling reduces the compressor flow capacity. However, at low compressor speeds, the choking of the HP rotor.

Build-up of deposits due to fouling increases the tendency for the flow to separate at the trailing edge.

# 9 Gas turbine performance deterioration

Earlier chapters described the matching of engine component characteristics, namely compressors, combustors and turbines in determining gas turbine performance. In fact, it is the interaction of engine components that determines engine parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds and power outputs. Any engine performance deterioration results from a change in the component characteristic of the deteriorated components. The interaction of these deteriorated characteristics results in a loss of power output and thermal efficiency. The measurable parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows and speeds will also change for a given engine operating condition and the effect of performance deterioration is summarised in Fig. 9.1. Useful discussions are found in Ping and Saravanamuttoo1 and Urban2.

The following conditions are typical causes of gas turbine performance deterioration:

- fouling
- variable inlet guide vane and variable stator vane problems
