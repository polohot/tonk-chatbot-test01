Thus the latent heat supplied is wasted in the exhaust system, resulting in a decrease in the gas turbine efficiency. At ambient temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, a greater loss in thermal efficiency occurs because the turbine entry temperature decreases due to constant speed operation. The loss in thermal efficiency at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius is about 4%, whereas the loss in thermal efficiency at 0 degrees Celsius is about 6%. Thus, water injection at low ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, may be uneconomical because of the increase in fuel cost, unless the fuel is relatively inexpensive.

Effect of water injection on turbine creep life. Celsius, the gas generator creep life usage reduces and this is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature.

The power turbine creep life also decreases for ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius and this is because of the increase in power output from the power turbine, resulting in increased stresses due to the increase in torque in the blades. At ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius, the reduction in power turbine creep life usage is due to the decrease in the exhaust gas temperature, when the gas turbine power output is limited by the gas generator speed.

Since water injection gives rise only to a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures, it is unlikely that water injection would be employed at these temperatures when the increase in fuel cost, due to the marked reduction in thermal efficiency, is significant. Thus it may not be possible to exploit the decreased creep life usage at low ambient temperature to compensate for the loss in creep life at high ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Therefore, an increase in engine overhaul frequency will lead to increased maintenance costs. Water injection also results in damage to the combustion system due to the significant chilling of the flame, resulting in increased thermal stress cycles and corrosion, hence adding further maintenance costs. It must be noted that demineralised water must be used and this adds to the operating cost.

The greatest effect of water injection directly into the primary zone of the combustion system is a significant suppression of NO emissions as discussed in Section 6.9. The impact of water injection on NOˣₓ and CO emissions is

Effect of water injection on turbine creep life. Celsius, the gas generator creep life usage reduces and this is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature.

The power turbine creep life also decreases for ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius and this is because of the increase in power output from the power turbine, resulting in increased stresses due to the increase in torque in the blades. At ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius, the reduction in power turbine creep life usage is due to the decrease in the exhaust gas temperature, when the gas turbine power output is limited by the gas generator speed.

Since water injection gives rise only to a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures, it is unlikely that water injection would be employed at these temperatures when the increase in fuel cost, due to the marked reduction in thermal efficiency, is significant. Thus it may not be possible to exploit the decreased creep life usage at low ambient temperature to compensate for the loss in creep life at high ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Therefore, an increase in engine overhaul frequency will lead to increased maintenance costs. Water injection also results in damage to the combustion system due to the significant chilling of the flame, resulting in increased thermal stress cycles and corrosion, hence adding further maintenance costs. It must be noted that demineralised water must be used and this adds to the operating cost.

The greatest effect of water injection directly into the primary zone of the combustion system is a significant suppression of NO emissions as discussed in Section 6.9. The impact of water injection on NOˣₓ and CO emissions is

Thus the latent heat supplied is wasted in the exhaust system, resulting in a decrease in the gas turbine efficiency. At ambient temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, a greater loss in thermal efficiency occurs because the turbine entry temperature decreases due to constant speed operation. The loss in thermal efficiency at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius is about 4%, whereas the loss in thermal efficiency at 0 degrees Celsius is about 6%. Thus, water injection at low ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, may be uneconomical because of the increase in fuel cost, unless the fuel is relatively inexpensive. However, water injection can suppress NOₓ emissions significantly and would be used for reducing emissions at such low ambient temperatures. This is discussed later in this section.

Effect of water injection on turbine creep life. Celsius, the gas generator creep life usage reduces and this is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature.

The power turbine creep life also decreases for ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius and this is because of the increase in power output from the power turbine, resulting in increased stresses due to the increase in torque in the blades. At ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius, the reduction in power turbine creep life usage is due to the decrease in the exhaust gas temperature, when the gas turbine power output is limited by the gas generator speed.

Since water injection gives rise only to a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures, it is unlikely that water injection would be employed at these temperatures when the increase in fuel cost, due to the marked reduction in thermal efficiency, is significant. Thus it may not be possible to exploit the decreased creep life usage at low ambient temperature to compensate for the loss in creep life at high ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Therefore, an increase in engine overhaul frequency will lead to increased maintenance costs. Water injection also results in damage to the combustion system due to the significant chilling of the flame, resulting in increased thermal stress cycles and corrosion, hence adding further maintenance costs.

Effect of water injection on turbine creep life. Celsius, the gas generator creep life usage reduces and this is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature.

The power turbine creep life also decreases for ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius and this is because of the increase in power output from the power turbine, resulting in increased stresses due to the increase in torque in the blades. At ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius, the reduction in power turbine creep life usage is due to the decrease in the exhaust gas temperature, when the gas turbine power output is limited by the gas generator speed.

Since water injection gives rise only to a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures, it is unlikely that water injection would be employed at these temperatures when the increase in fuel cost, due to the marked reduction in thermal efficiency, is significant. Thus it may not be possible to exploit the decreased creep life usage at low ambient temperature to compensate for the loss in creep life at high ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Therefore, an increase in engine overhaul frequency will lead to increased maintenance costs. Water injection also results in damage to the combustion system due to the significant chilling of the flame, resulting in increased thermal stress cycles and corrosion, hence adding further maintenance costs. It must be noted that demineralised water must be used and this adds to the operating cost.

The greatest effect of water injection directly into the primary zone of the combustion system is a significant suppression of NO emissions as discussed in Section 6.9. The impact of water injection on NOˣₓ and CO emissions is

Thus the latent heat supplied is wasted in the exhaust system, resulting in a decrease in the gas turbine efficiency. At ambient temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, a greater loss in thermal efficiency occurs because the turbine entry temperature decreases due to constant speed operation. The loss in thermal efficiency at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius is about 4%, whereas the loss in thermal efficiency at 0 degrees Celsius is about 6%. Thus, water injection at low ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, may be uneconomical because of the increase in fuel cost, unless the fuel is relatively inexpensive.

At ambient temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, a greater loss in thermal efficiency occurs because the turbine entry temperature decreases due to constant speed operation.

Effect of water injection on turbine creep life. Celsius, the gas generator creep life usage reduces and this is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature.

The power turbine creep life also decreases for ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius and this is because of the increase in power output from the power turbine, resulting in increased stresses due to the increase in torque in the blades. At ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius, the reduction in power turbine creep life usage is due to the decrease in the exhaust gas temperature, when the gas turbine power output is limited by the gas generator speed.

Since water injection gives rise only to a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures, it is unlikely that water injection would be employed at these temperatures when the increase in fuel cost, due to the marked reduction in thermal efficiency, is significant. Thus it may not be possible to exploit the decreased creep life usage at low ambient temperature to compensate for the loss in creep life at high ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Therefore, an increase in engine overhaul frequency will lead to increased maintenance costs. Water injection also results in damage to the combustion system due to the significant chilling of the flame, resulting in increased thermal stress cycles and corrosion, hence adding further maintenance costs. It must be noted that demineralised water must be used and this adds to the operating cost.

Effect of water injection on turbine creep life. Celsius, the gas generator creep life usage reduces and this is primarily due to the decrease in the turbine entry temperature.

The power turbine creep life also decreases for ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius and this is because of the increase in power output from the power turbine, resulting in increased stresses due to the increase in torque in the blades. At ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius, the reduction in power turbine creep life usage is due to the decrease in the exhaust gas temperature, when the gas turbine power output is limited by the gas generator speed.

Since water injection gives rise only to a small increase in power output at low ambient temperatures, it is unlikely that water injection would be employed at these temperatures when the increase in fuel cost, due to the marked reduction in thermal efficiency, is significant. Thus it may not be possible to exploit the decreased creep life usage at low ambient temperature to compensate for the loss in creep life at high ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Therefore, an increase in engine overhaul frequency will lead to increased maintenance costs. Water injection also results in damage to the combustion system due to the significant chilling of the flame, resulting in increased thermal stress cycles and corrosion, hence adding further maintenance costs. It must be noted that demineralised water must be used and this adds to the operating cost.

The greatest effect of water injection directly into the primary zone of the combustion system is a significant suppression of NO emissions as discussed in Section 6.9. The impact of water injection on NOˣₓ and CO emissions is

Thus the latent heat supplied is wasted in the exhaust system, resulting in a decrease in the gas turbine efficiency. At ambient temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, a greater loss in thermal efficiency occurs because the turbine entry temperature decreases due to constant speed operation. The loss in thermal efficiency at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius is about 4%, whereas the loss in thermal efficiency at 0 degrees Celsius is about 6%. Thus, water injection at low ambient temperatures, where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, may be uneconomical because of the increase in fuel cost, unless the fuel is relatively inexpensive. However, water injection can suppress NOₓ emissions significantly and would be used for reducing emissions at such low ambient temperatures. This is discussed later in this section.
