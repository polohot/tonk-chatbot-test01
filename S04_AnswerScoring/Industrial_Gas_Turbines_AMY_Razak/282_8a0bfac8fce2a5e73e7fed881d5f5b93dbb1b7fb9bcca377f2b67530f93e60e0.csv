Since the compressor is operating at a constant non-dimensional speed, the non-dimensional temperature rise across the compressor does not change much and hence no significant change is seen in the compressor discharge temperature due to hot end damage. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature also results in decreases in the combustor primary zone temperature and in the turbine metal temperature. The trends in these temperatures due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. ",Why does the compressor operate at a constant non-dimensional speed in the simulation?,A3,A constant non-dimensional speed is used to simplify the simulation by keeping compressor dynamics uniform.,2.34375,2.578125,3.46875,1.3828125,0.287109375

The decrease in T₃/T₁ shown in Fig. 18.26 results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the compressor inlet temperature remains constant during this simulation. The EGT remains on the limit as it prevents the engine from overheating the turbine during high-power operation. Since the compressor is operating at a constant non-dimensional speed, the non-dimensional temperature rise across the compressor does not change much and hence no significant change is seen in the compressor discharge temperature due to hot end damage. The decrease in the turbine entry temperature also results in decreases in the combustor primary zone temperature and in the turbine metal temperature. The trends in these temperatures due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. ",Why does the compressor operate at a constant non-dimensional speed in the simulation?,A4,This approach ensures that the compressor's non-dimensional temperature rise remains steady for accurate assessment.,1.90625,2.1875,3.296875,1.5625,0.341796875
