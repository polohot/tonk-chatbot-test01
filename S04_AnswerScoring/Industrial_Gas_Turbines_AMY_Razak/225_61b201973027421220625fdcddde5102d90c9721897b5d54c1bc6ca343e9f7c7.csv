# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14. ","How does ambient temperature affect the performance limiting parameters of a gas turbine as described in 'Gas Turbine Theory, 5th Edition'?",A4,The book explains that the limiting parameter shifts from exhaust gas temperature to gas generator speed and then to compressor non-dimensional speed as ambient temperature decreases.,1.4609375,1.65625,3.375,1.59375,0.408203125

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14. ",How does water injection into the combustion system augment gas turbine power output?,A1,"By increasing the flow through the turbines, thus enhancing power output.",1.1171875,1.328125,3.359375,1.0546875,0.1962890625

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14. ",How does water injection into the combustion system augment gas turbine power output?,A3,"The injection of water into the combustion system increases turbine flow, leading to higher power output.",1.5,1.5546875,3.359375,1.2265625,0.2021484375

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14. ","What are the three main parameters that limit the power output of a gas turbine according to 'Gas Turbine Theory, 5th Edition'?",A5,"The book 'Gas Turbine Theory, 5th Edition' highlights that the power output of a gas turbine is constrained by the exhaust gas temperature, the gas generator's speed, and the compressor's non-dimensional speed.",3.453125,3.515625,3.828125,1.796875,1.125

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4.

However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

14.10 Variation of gas turbine thermal efficiency due to reduction in power turbine capacity.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

# 14 Power augmentation

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.

The power output of the gas turbine is limited, as has been seen, by the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed. The exhaust gas temperature limit prevents the turbine from overheating thus preventing the excess usage of turbine creep life. The gas generator speed limit prevents the over-stressing of the rotating members such as compressor/turbine blades and discs. Any increase in stress levels due to speed excursions will also contribute to a reduction in turbine creep life. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit prevents the compressor from stalling and surging at high compressor speeds due to choke conditions at the inlet of the compressor.

It has been observed that, at different ambient temperatures, the performance of the gas turbine is limited by different limiting parameters. At high ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, it is the exhaust gas temperature that limits the engine performance. At ambient temperatures between +15 and –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the gas generator speed and at ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius, the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed. The values for these parameters are as follows and are referred to as the continuous rating or base rating:

- exhaust gas temperature limit 1058 K
- gas generator speed limit 9500 RPM
- compressor non-dimensional speed limit 587.

At high ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is restricted by the exhaust gas temperature limit, the performance of the gas turbine may be improved by increasing the limit by about 20 degrees Celsius. However, there will be a significant reduction in turbine creep life due to the higher operating blade temperatures and stress. Augmenting the power by increasing the exhaust gas temperature limit is often referred to as peak rating.

The gas generator speed limit is normally the base-rated condition, which corresponds to its 100% value of 9500 RPM. However, manufacturers often

# Power augmentation

offer a maximum continuous rating value, which usually corresponds to 105% gas generator speed. Thus at ambient temperatures when the engine performance is restricted by the gas generator speed, the gas generator speed limit can be increased to the maximum continuous rating value, thereby improving the performance of the engine. Operating at the maximum continuous rating will have an impact on the turbine creep life, due to the increased stress and turbine blade temperatures resulting from higher gas temperatures required to achieve the increased gas generator speed. Thus the manufacturer will require major engine overhauls on a more frequent basis, which result in increasing maintenance costs.

At very low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, it may not be possible to improve the engine performance by increasing the compressor non-dimensional speed limit because compressor surge could be encountered, which should be avoided.

However, when operating is at low ambient temperatures for significant periods, it may be possible to increase the engine performance by reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The net effect of reducing the power turbine non-dimensional flow capacity is to increase the compressor pressure ratio and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, when the engine performance in limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. Thus a significant increase in both thermal efficiency and power output results and this will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the increase in T₃/T₁ will increase T₃, resulting in a higher turbine blade temperature, which reduces the turbine creep life, and hence increases maintenance cost.

The engine simulator will now be used to augment the power output from the gas turbine using each of these methods and the effect on performance, emissions and loss in creep life will be determined.

# 14.1 Peak rating

The simulator is run by setting the generator power demand at 25 MW, thus ensuring the engine is always on an engine limit. The exhaust gas temperature limit is increased by 20 degrees Celsius to 1078 K (peak rating value) and then the ambient temperature changed from 30 degrees to –30 degrees Celsius in steps of 10 degrees. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature limit will result in an increase in T₄(EGT)/T₁. From Fig. 11.6, which shows the variation of T₄(EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed (N₁/√T₁), an increase in compressor non-dimensional speed will result. Thus an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and power output will also occur. For a given ambient temperature, T₁, the increase in N₁/√T₁ will also result in an increase in the gas generator speed, N₁, due to peak rating.

# 378 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius, a significant increase in power output may be achieved (Fig. 14.1). The higher the ambient temperature, the larger is the increase in power due to peak rating. For example, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine would increase from about 18.2 MW to 19.4 MW, representing nearly a 7% increase in power output due to peak rating. However, at about 20 degrees Celsius, the power output from the gas turbine increases from about 20 MW to 21 MW during peak rating, which represents only about 5% increase in power output. At lower ambient temperatures, the gain in power output is even smaller as the gas generator speed limit is reached. In fact, at ambient temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, no peak rating is possible as the gas generator speed would have reached its limiting value, therefore forcing the exhaust gas temperature to decrease.

The increase in maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, T₃/T₁, and compressor pressure ratio, results in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency during peak rating and this is shown in Fig. 14.2. Thus a useful reduction in fuel costs will also result because of peak rating.

The increase in gas generator speed and turbine blade temperature during peak rating results in an increase in the turbine creep life usage. This can be seen in Fig. 14.3 where the change in the gas generator and power turbine creep life usage with ambient temperature is shown. The increase in the turbine creep life usage during peak rating is approximately constant over a range of ambient temperatures when the EGT limits the performance of the gas turbine. The loss in the gas generator turbine creep life is about 40%, whereas the loss in the power turbine creep life is about 45%. Thus peak rating almost doubles the turbine creep life usage.

# 14.3 Effect of peak rating on turbine creep.

The impact of peak rating on gas turbine emissions is shown in Fig. 14.4. Since the compressor pressure ratio, the combustion pressure and the combustion temperature have increased during peak rating, the NOx emissions will increase. However, an increase in these parameters will result in a reduction of CO. CO2 emissions will also increase due to the increased power output during peak rating because of increased fuel flow.

# 14.4 Change in gas turbine emissions during peak rating.

Although a significant increase in creep life usage occurs during peak rating, on occasions, increased revenue due to the increased power generation capacity will justify the increased maintenance costs.

Thus the business case for peak rating should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the increased capacity, better thermal efficiency and increased maintenance costs, particularly at high ambient temperatures, where the increase in power output is the greatest for a given loss in turbine creep life.

# 14.2 Maximum continuous rating

It has been stated that the base rating of the engine restricts the gas generator speed to 100%. However, manufacturers may allow a maximum continuous rating of 105% gas generator speed, provided the impact on turbine creep life is not too excessive. This may be the case at low ambient temperatures where the engine power output is limited by the gas generator speed, resulting in reduction in turbine creep life usage due to the reduction in turbine temperatures (Section 11.3).

Increasing the gas generator speed limit to the maximum continuous rating value will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed for a given ambient temperature. This will result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and compressor inlet mass flow rate, and therefore an increase in thermal efficiency and power output from the gas turbine will occur.

The increased power output during maximum continuous rating is shown in Fig. 14.5. The maximum increase in power occurs at an ambient temperature.

of about 5 degrees Celsius. The power output from the gas turbine increases from about 21.3 MW to about 22 MW, representing about a 3% increase in power output. Thus, a useful increase in power output can be achieved during maximum continuous rating. Figure 14.6 shows the change in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating. There is also a useful increase in thermal efficiency during maximum continuous rating due to the higher.

Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. The increase in the gas generator speed limit results in an increase in ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the exhaust gas temperature. Operating at maximum continuous rating also results in an increase in the ambient temperature range where the engine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed. In fact, there is no operation at constant gas generator speed on this engine when operating at maximum continuous rating.

The impact of maximum continuous rating on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.7. An increase in turbine life usage is observed to occur during maximum continuous rating operation. However, this increase is not as dramatic as with the case of peak rating. Nonetheless, the manufacturer may require an increase in engine maintenance frequency to allow for the reduction in turbine creep life. It would be possible to maintain the same maintenance frequency but to accept a reduced exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, resulting in a loss in power output at these ambient temperatures. Although, at first sight, it may appear unacceptable to the operator to reduce the exhaust gas temperature limit at higher ambient temperatures, in temperate countries where maximum power demand is often at low ambient temperatures, such a compromise may result in more revenue and thus more profit.

Figure 14.8 shows the change in gas turbine emissions when operating at the maximum continuous rating. The increase in compressor pressure ratio and combustion temperature results in an increase in NOx and a decrease in CO.

# 14.3 Power augmentation at very low ambient temperatures

At ambient temperatures below –15 degrees Celsius it has been observed that the gas turbine power output is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and the maximum non-dimensional speed of the compressor cannot be increased due to the likelihood of compressor surge. It has also been observed that, as the ambient temperature falls, the gas generator speed increases and eventually becomes the factor that limits the engine performance. To increase the power output at such low temperatures, a method of increasing the turbine entry temperature is required whilst the compressor non-dimensional speed is not increased.

From the discussion of the component matching process for turbines operating in series in Section 8.2 (Fig. 8.12), the effect of reducing the power turbine area, and thus its non-dimensional flow capacity, will decrease the gas generator turbine pressure ratio. If operation is continued at a constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the power balance between the compressor and gas generator turbine will result in an increase in turbine entry temperature. Furthermore, the flow compatibility between the compressor and the gas generator turbine will also result in an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus, by reducing the power turbine area, at ambient temperatures where the power output from the gas turbine is limited by the compressor non-dimensional speed, an increase in thermal efficiency and power output will occur due to the higher compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.

# 384 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

At high ambient temperatures, where the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output, a loss in power output and thermal efficiency will occur. Since the exhaust gas temperature limit cannot be increased, any reduction in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio due to the reduction of the power turbine capacity results in a decrease in the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise in order to satisfy the power balance between the compressor and the gas generator turbine. Thus a decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio and inlet mass flow rate will occur (i.e. for a given EGT a decrease in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in a decrease in the turbine entry temperature, T₃). These three factors will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency when operating at high ambient temperatures.

It may thus be argued that an increase in power turbine capacity will help improve the gas turbine performance at high ambient temperatures. However, an increase in compressor non-dimensional temperature must occur due to the increased gas generator turbine pressure ratio and therefore an increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature results. The increase in gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature will result in an increase in turbine creep life usage, which may be unacceptable.

# Figure 14.9

shows the change in power due to a decrease in power turbine capacity. The power turbine capacity was reduced by 3%, achieved by setting the power turbine fouling fault index to –3%. The range of ambient temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the gas turbine power output has now increased.

14.9 Change in power output with ambient temperature due to a decrease in power turbine capacity.

# Power augmentation

Temperature operation for the base rated case is from 30 to about 15 degrees Celsius, below which the power output is limited by the gas generator speed. Where there is a reduction in the power turbine capacity, the ambient temperature range for constant exhaust gas temperature operation now increases to 30 to about 0 degrees Celsius.

It is observed that the power output due to the decrease in power turbine capacity exceeds the base-rating case when the ambient temperature decreases to below 10 degrees Celsius. This is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature and therefore higher turbine entry temperature. At an ambient temperature of –5 degrees Celsius, the power output increases from about 21.4 MW to about 22.7 MW, which is a 6% increase. At lower ambient temperatures, the increase in power output is even greater. However, at ambient temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius, a loss in power output results due to the decrease in turbine entry temperature as explained above. Thus a significant increase in power output is possible by optimising the power turbine capacity at low ambient temperatures, when the engine performance is limited by the gas generator speed. This results in increased revenue and profit.

The increases in compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature at low ambient temperatures result in an increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Thus a reduction in fuel costs in real terms will occur, leading to lower operating costs. At high ambient temperatures, of course, a decrease in thermal efficiency would be incurred, due to the reasons discussed above and thus fuel costs would increase.

# 386 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The impact of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life is shown in Fig. 14.11. At ambient temperatures above 12 degrees Celsius, the gas generator turbine creep life usage is actually smaller compared with the base-rating case. This is due to the reduction in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature when the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine power output. There is also a slight reduction in the power turbine creep life usage above an ambient temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. This is due to the lower stress in the turbine blades resulting from less torque due to the reduction in gas turbine power output.

At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the gas turbine creep life usage increases and this increase is due to the increase in turbine entry temperature that arises from the reduced power turbine capacity. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the power turbine life also decreases and this is due to the higher exhaust gas temperature compared with the base-rating case. This is shown in Fig. 14.11, which illustrates the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on turbine creep life.

Although a significant increase in turbine creep life usage occurs at low ambient temperatures, the creep life is still above 20 000 hours, when normally engine overhauls are necessary. However, manufacturers may want an increased frequency of engine overhaul but the improvement in creep life usage at high ambient temperature should be considered before agreeing to any such increase in engine maintenance. Clearly, a worthwhile increase in power output at low ambient temperatures is possible without any significant change in maintenance cost. Furthermore, the increase in the thermal efficiency will

# Power augmentation

Reduce fuel costs resulting in lower operating costs. However, the drawback is lower power output and thermal efficiency at high ambient temperatures. If demand for power is important during winter months, then such optimisation of the power turbine capacity will result in higher profits during these months. The increase in fuel costs during the summer months would have to be carefully evaluated before deciding whether such optimisation results in reduced life cycle costs.

A similar improvement in engine performance at low ambient temperatures may be obtained by increasing the gas generator turbine swallowing capacity. The reader is left to run the simulator to demonstrate the impact of increasing the gas generator turbine capacity on engine performance at low ambient temperatures.

# Figure 14.12

Shows the effect of reduced power turbine capacity on engine emissions. At high ambient temperatures, the decrease in turbine entry temperature, compressor pressure ratio, and thus combustion pressure, results in a decrease in NOx and an increase in CO. At low ambient temperatures the increase in combustion pressure and temperature results in the increase of NOx and decrease in CO.

# Figure 14.13

Shows the shift of the running line on the compressor characteristic. It is observed that the running line has indeed shifted towards surge, thereby reducing the surge margin. However, this shift in the running line is small. The VIGV/VSV schedule may be changed if necessary so that the variable stators do not open as much. This could increase the surge margin, but reduce the flow capacity of the compressor, and the resultant loss in compressor capacity should be taken into account.

# 14.4 Power augmentation by water injection

Gas turbine power output may be augmented by water injection. Water may be injected into the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. When water is injected into the inlet of the compressor, the reduction of the compressor inlet temperature due to the evaporation of the water is primarily responsible for the increase in power output. The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the larger is the amount of water that can be evaporated, resulting in a greater decrease in the compressor inlet temperature. Such means of power augmentation is, in fact, referred to as turbine inlet cooling and is only applicable where the relative humidity of the air is low and the ambient temperature is high. Turbine inlet cooling will be discussed in the next section.

Direct injection of water into the primary zone augments the power output by increasing the flow through the turbines. The ambient temperature and humidity have no influence on how much water can be injected, but injection is limited by the increase in emission of CO and UHC. In this section the impact of direct injection of water into the combustion system on engine performance is considered.

The increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection into the combustion system is shown in Fig. 14.14.
