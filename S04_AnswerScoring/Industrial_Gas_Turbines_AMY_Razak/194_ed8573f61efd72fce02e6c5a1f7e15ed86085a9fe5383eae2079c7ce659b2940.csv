# 11.3.6 Trends in temperature

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",How do manufacturers ensure good turbine creep life across varying ambient temperatures?,A1,Manufacturers restrict gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures and use rating curves to balance creep life across operating conditions.,1.953125,1.9375,3.390625,1.609375,0.359375

The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10).

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",How does the gas generator turbine creep life usage change during constant exhaust gas temperature operation?,A1,"Creep life usage remains essentially constant, as the decrease in turbine blade temperature offsets the increased stress from higher speeds.",1.3125,1.2578125,3.25,1.3203125,0.416015625

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10).

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ","How does the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, change during the ambient temperature transient and why?",A1,"T₅ decreases due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 11.10.",0.80859375,0.90625,3.1875,1.375,0.294921875

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂. The Figure also includes the combustion primary zone temperature whose trend is very

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ","How does the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, change during the ambient temperature transient and why?",A4,"T₅'s decline is directly linked to the rising pressure ratio in the power turbine, illustrated in Fig. 11.10.",0.9140625,1.0234375,3.15625,1.4453125,0.353515625

This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",What are the trends in pressure at the compressor discharge and turbine entry during the ambient temperature transient?,A4,The increase in P₂ and P₃ pressures is attributed to the compressor pressure ratio's rise during the transient.,2.078125,2.03125,3.3125,1.4296875,0.486328125

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18).

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",What explains the constant turbine entry temperature during the ambient temperature transient?,A4,"The stability in turbine entry temperature is a protective measure against overheating, noted during constant exhaust gas temperature phases.",1.7421875,1.8046875,3.171875,1.4609375,0.357421875

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

similar to that of the turbine entry temperature. The primary zone temperature is much too high for the turbine and the combustion dilution zone reduces the temperature of the products of combustion entering the turbine sufficiently to ensure satisfactory turbine creep life.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",What factors contribute to the increase in power turbine creep life usage during constant exhaust gas temperature operation?,A2,"Higher power output increases torque and stress on power turbine blades, elevating creep life usage.",1.59375,1.75,3.453125,1.203125,0.275390625

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",What trends are observed in the compressor discharge temperature during the ambient temperature transient?,A2,"A minor decrease in compressor discharge temperature occurs, even with higher pressure ratios, because of the falling ambient temperature.",2.265625,2.34375,3.59375,1.3828125,0.4375

# 11.3.6 Trends in temperature

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂. The Figure also includes the combustion primary zone temperature whose trend is very

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10.

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions.

Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",Why does the gas turbine power output decrease despite an increase in airflow during certain periods of operation?,A5,"Power output decreases with increased airflow during constant non-dimensional speed operation due to the limitations it imposes on engine performance, referenced in Fig. 11.14.",1.0,0.96484375,3.125,1.328125,0.408203125

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂. The Figure also includes the combustion primary zone temperature whose trend is very

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs.

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10).

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",Why does turbine creep life usage decrease significantly at lower ambient temperatures when engine performance is governed by gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed?,A5,Creep life usage falls sharply due to the combined effect of lower temperatures and speed limitations.,0.8359375,1.2265625,3.0625,1.1875,-0.158203125

# 11.3.6 Trends in temperature

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂. The Figure also includes the combustion primary zone temperature whose trend is very

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant. Since the ambient pressure and the inlet and exhaust losses remain constant during the ambient temperature transient, the compressor inlet pressure,

The temperature changes in the engine during the transient in the ambient temperature, T₁, are shown in Fig. 11.15. In the period of engine operation where the exhaust gas temperature is constant, it is observed that the turbine entry temperature is also essentially constant, thus preventing the gas generator turbine from overheating. Note that the power turbine exit temperature, T₅, decreases during the ambient temperature transient and this is due to the increase in the power turbine pressure ratio as shown in Fig. 11.10. The compressor discharge temperature also decreases slightly, although the compressor pressure ratio increases during this period (see Fig. 11.10). Although the compressor temperature ratio, T₂/T₁, increases, the decrease in T₁ during the ambient temperature transient is sufficient to decrease T₂.

# 11.3.7 Trends in pressure

Figure 11.16 shows the trends in pressure at the inlet and exit of each engine component. The compressor discharge pressure and the turbine entry pressure, P₂ and P₃, respectively, increase during the periods of operation when the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed. During these periods of operation, there is an increase in compressor pressure ratio as discussed previously and shown in Fig. 11.10; thus there is an increase in these pressures as the ambient temperature falls.

The Figure also shows that the gas generator turbine exit pressure or the power turbine inlet pressure, P₄ increases during the change in ambient temperature. Note from Fig. 11.10 that the gas generator pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choking conditions that prevail in the power turbine. Thus, as the gas generator turbine entry pressure increases, there will be an increase in P₄. At low ambient temperature when the engine performance is controlled by the compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor pressure ratio remains constant. Thus the compressor discharge pressure, turbine entry pressure and the power inlet pressure also remain constant.

# 11.3.8 Trends in turbine creep life

Turbine creep life analysis was discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6), stating the importance of turbine blade temperature and stress on the plastic deformation of the turbine material when operating at elevated temperatures, even though the stresses in the blade material are below its yield point. The time for a given amount of plastic deformation defines the creep life of the turbine blade material. At the high temperatures that prevail in the gas generator turbine, the turbine creep life is about 20,000 hours operating at the design point and under ISO conditions. Significant turbine cooling is employed to maintain the blade temperature at about 1100 K. The corresponding turbine creep life for the power turbine is about 75,000 hours. The gas temperatures are much lower for the power turbine, which operates at about 1050 K. This compares with the gas entering the gas generator turbine, which may be at about 1400 K. Thus the simulator assumes that no turbine cooling is necessary for the power turbine blades.

Figure 11.17 shows the trends in the creep life usage for the gas generator and power turbines. The gas generator creep life usage remains essentially constant at ambient temperatures where the engine performance is controlled by the exhaust gas temperature. As the ambient temperature falls below 25.

11.17 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life during ambient temperature transient.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

degrees Celsius, the gas generator speed increases as seen in Fig. 11.8 during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. This increase in speed will indeed increase the (centrifugal) stresses in the turbine rotor blade. Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs.

Furthermore, the gas generator turbine temperature drop will be constant due to the constant turbine pressure ratio resulting from the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine and results in near-constant turbine entry temperature. The increase in mass flow rate through the engine (see Fig. 11.11) implies that the gas generator turbine power output is increasing and it is necessary to satisfy the increased power demand from the compressor as the ambient temperature decreases. Thus, the torque on the turbine rotor blades may also increase. The effect of the increased speed and torque will increase the stress on the rotor blades, thus having an adverse effect on the gas generator turbine creep life usage and reducing the time between overhauls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. However, the cooling air temperature, T₂, decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, hence reducing the turbine blade temperature (see Fig. 11.15) as the ambient temperature falls during constant exhaust gas temperature operation. The net effect of these changes is that the change in gas generator creep life usage is minimal during constant exhaust gas temperature operation.

The impact on power turbine creep life usage is somewhat different. In the simulator the power turbine drives an electrical generator, which operates at constant (synchronous) speed. Thus the centrifugal stress remains constant. The power output from the gas turbine and thus the power generated increases as the ambient temperature falls during the period of constant exhaust gas temperature operation, as seen in Figs 11.12 and 11.14. This increase in power output at lower ambient temperatures increases the torque and stress on the rotor blades of the power turbine. It has been assumed that the power turbine is not cooled and therefore the power turbine blade temperature would be the same as the gas temperature (EGT), which is constant during this period of operation. Thus an increase in power turbine creep life usage is observed during the operating period when the exhaust gas temperature is constant.

When operating at lower ambient temperatures where the engine performance is governed by either the gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed, the creep life usage of both turbines decreases significantly. The turbine entry temperature and exhaust gas temperature decrease during the period of operation when the gas generator speed is constant or when the compressor non-dimensional speed in constant (Fig. 11.15). Also note that the gas generator speed falls with decreasing ambient temperature when operating at constant compressor non-dimensional speed (Fig. 11.8). Irrespective of the changes in stress levels (due to restrictions in speed), the lower operating temperatures result in this significant decrease in turbine creep life usage. Figure 11.18 shows the creep life usage represented.

as time to next overhaul of the turbines plotted on an ambient temperature basis. At ambient temperatures below –12 degrees Celsius, hardly any creep life usage occurs.

Manufacturers often restrict the gas generator speeds at low ambient temperatures to achieve good creep life at high ambient operating conditions. The manufacturers assume a certain number of hours of engine operation at low and high ambient temperatures in determining turbine creep life and often refer to these operating cycles as rating curves. Rating curves find their origins in aero-engines, where the exhaust gas temperature limit may be raised on hot days to achieve adequate thrust for take-off. On cold days, the exhaust gas temperature limit would be reduced to compensate for the lost creep life when operating on hot days. The improved engine performance at low ambient temperatures would be adequate to ensure satisfactory engine performance for take-off. By restricting the power output at low ambient temperatures, such rating curves are normally universal and applicable to engines operating in any part of the world. Hence the manufacturer would guarantee the turbine creep life, no matter where in the world the engine operates.

# 11.3.9 Trends in emission

Gas turbine emissions such as NO and CO are dependent on the combustion pressure and temperature for a given fuel. In addition, NOₓ is dependent on the specific humidity of the combustion air. The higher the specific humidity, the lower are the NOₓ emissions due to the humidity suppressing the ‘peak’ combustion temperature. The higher the combustion pressure and temperature, the higher will be the NO x emissions.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on performance

However, these conditions prompt the oxidation of CO to CO2, thus reducing CO. Different operating conditions can give rise to significant changes in combustion pressures, temperatures and specific humidity, thus producing changes in such emissions. The simulator uses emission parametric models to predict the NOx and CO emissions, which are discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.18). The NOx emissions are predicted using the Bakken correlation and CO emissions are predicted using Rizk and Mongia’s correlation.

# Figure 11.19

shows the changes in NOx and CO during the ambient temperature transient. As the ambient temperature decreases and the engine performance is limited by the exhaust gas temperature, NOx increases while a small reduction in CO occurs. Figure 11.16 shows that the compressor discharge pressure increases during this period of engine operation, and thus an increase in the combustion pressure will occur. The mean primary zone temperature also increases and the specific humidity decreases (Fig. ",Why is the primary zone temperature in the combustion chamber much higher than the turbine can tolerate?,A5,"The combustion dilution zone reduces the primary zone's high temperatures to levels the turbine can endure, ensuring its longevity.",2.078125,2.1875,3.421875,1.296875,0.55859375
