# Foreword

Improving gas turbine performance involves the bringing together and optimisation of the disciplines and skills required to achieve an operationally competitive gas turbine engine. Certainly, the design and performance of individual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and turbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career.

Improving gas turbine performance involves the bringing together and optimisation of the disciplines and skills required to achieve an operationally competitive gas turbine engine. Certainly, the design and performance of individual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and turbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career.

Improving gas turbine performance involves the bringing together and optimisation of the disciplines and skills required to achieve an operationally competitive gas turbine engine. Certainly, the design and performance of individual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and turbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career.

Improving gas turbine performance involves the bringing together and optimisation of the disciplines and skills required to achieve an operationally competitive gas turbine engine. Certainly, the design and performance of individual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and turbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career.

Improving gas turbine performance involves the bringing together and optimisation of the disciplines and skills required to achieve an operationally competitive gas turbine engine. Certainly, the design and performance of individual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and turbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career.

Improving gas turbine performance involves the bringing together and optimisation of the disciplines and skills required to achieve an operationally competitive gas turbine engine. Certainly, the design and performance of individual engine components, such as the compressors, combustors and turbine, could alone present an engineer with a worthwhile career.
