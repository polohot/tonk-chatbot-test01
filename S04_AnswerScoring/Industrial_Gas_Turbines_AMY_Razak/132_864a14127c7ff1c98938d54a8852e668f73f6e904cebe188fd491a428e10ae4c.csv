# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation.

The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How do variable stator vanes (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) affect the compressor's efficiency and running line?,A4,"VSVs and VIGVs adjust the compressor's flow capacity, with efficiency changes influencing the running line indirectly through temperature and pressure ratios.",1.578125,1.7265625,3.125,1.4765625,0.30078125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does a reduction in gas generator turbine flow capacity impact the compressor's pressure ratio?,A1,A decrease in GG turbine flow capacity generally increases the compressor's pressure ratio to satisfy flow compatibility.,1.953125,2.421875,3.59375,1.4453125,0.208984375

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does a reduction in gas generator turbine flow capacity impact the compressor's pressure ratio?,A3,"The compressor pressure ratio rises in response to a GG turbine flow capacity reduction, maintaining system balance.",1.71875,1.984375,3.421875,1.5078125,0.32421875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

Rapid acceleration is made possible by opening the power turbine to increase the surge margin. However, care is needed to prevent overheating of the gas generator turbine because of increased fuel flow, thus high turbine entry temperatures, lead to unacceptable loss in turbine blade creep life.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does a reduction in gas generator turbine flow capacity impact the compressor's pressure ratio?,A5,"An increase in compressor pressure ratio compensates for the decreased GG turbine flow capacity, aligning with flow compatibility requirements.",1.8359375,2.171875,3.515625,1.4765625,0.42578125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

Rapid acceleration is made possible by opening the power turbine to increase the surge margin. However, care is needed to prevent overheating of the gas generator turbine because of increased fuel flow, thus high turbine entry temperatures, lead to unacceptable loss in turbine blade creep life.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does increasing the power turbine area affect the gas generator turbine pressure ratio?,A2,A larger power turbine area necessitates an increase in the gas generator turbine's pressure ratio for consistent non-dimensional flow.,1.6875,1.7890625,3.296875,1.5,0.44921875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does increasing the power turbine area affect the gas generator turbine pressure ratio?,A4,"Expanding the power turbine area elevates the pressure ratio across the gas generator turbine, adjusting the system's operational dynamics.",0.7890625,0.8515625,3.09375,1.4140625,0.51953125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

Variable geometry power turbines, as stated, are also useful in improving the transient response of a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. Rapid acceleration is made possible by opening the power turbine to increase the surge margin. However, care is needed to prevent overheating of the gas generator turbine because of increased fuel flow, thus high turbine entry temperatures, lead to unacceptable loss in turbine blade creep life.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does the closure of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) affect single-shaft gas turbines?,A1,"VIGV closure in single-shaft gas turbines reduces compressor flow, enabling constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers.",2.578125,2.609375,3.4375,1.5546875,0.314453125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, care is needed to prevent overheating of the gas generator turbine because of increased fuel flow, thus high turbine entry temperatures, lead to unacceptable loss in turbine blade creep life.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does the closure of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) affect single-shaft gas turbines?,A3,"In single-shaft configurations, VIGV closure controls compressor flow, facilitating stable combustion temperatures at reduced power.",2.4375,2.484375,3.421875,1.6484375,0.326171875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does the closure of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) affect single-shaft gas turbines?,A5,"VIGV closure at high speeds may decrease compressor efficiency, negatively impacting engine performance.",1.515625,1.6875,3.296875,1.28125,0.251953125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does the efficiency of a compressor change with the closure of VSVs/VIGVs at different speeds?,A2,High-speed closure of these vanes may decrease efficiency due to the adverse effects on airflow and stage performance.,1.65625,1.828125,3.359375,1.203125,0.1708984375

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",How does the efficiency of a compressor change with the closure of VSVs/VIGVs at different speeds?,A4,Efficiency improvements at lower speeds are offset by inefficiencies at higher speeds when VSVs/VIGVs are closed.,1.8046875,1.8515625,3.421875,1.2265625,0.1142578125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation.

Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What are the benefits of using variable geometry power turbines in two-shaft gas turbines?,A1,"Variable geometry power turbines can prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power, reducing the need for wasteful blow-off.",2.015625,2.03125,3.453125,1.3828125,0.2060546875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What are the benefits of using variable geometry power turbines in two-shaft gas turbines?,A3,These turbines provide substantial engine braking capabilities and improve transient response by adjusting the surge margin.,2.078125,2.046875,3.359375,1.390625,0.265625

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What are the benefits of using variable geometry power turbines in two-shaft gas turbines?,A5,"They enable constant turbine entry temperature operation at off-design conditions, beneficial for DLE combustion engines.",1.609375,1.4765625,2.953125,1.421875,0.2060546875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of variable nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) on turbine flow capacity in 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A2,"Changes in NGV flow area directly affect the turbine's flow capacity, with adjustments redistributing pressure ratios in series-operating turbines.",2.09375,2.25,3.484375,1.7734375,0.357421875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation. For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of variable nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) on turbine flow capacity in 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A4,"Adjusting the NGV flow area modifies the turbine's capacity, crucial for managing pressure ratios and flow compatibility in multi-shaft systems.",2.046875,2.125,3.484375,1.7890625,0.400390625

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation. For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of blow-off valve operation on the compressor's pressure ratio according to 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A1,"Blow-off valve operation decreases the compressor's pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line to satisfy flow compatibility.",2.5,2.71875,3.578125,1.8046875,0.6640625

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation. For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of blow-off valve operation on the compressor's pressure ratio according to 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A3,"The pressure ratio P2/P1 decreases during blow-off valve operation, a direct consequence of the altered flow and temperature ratios.",2.296875,2.53125,3.625,1.6171875,0.466796875

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation. For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the impact of blow-off valve operation on the compressor's pressure ratio according to 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A5,"Blow-off valve operation impacts the compressor by lowering the pressure ratio, P2/P1, to align with the new flow conditions established by the valve.",2.5625,2.671875,3.53125,1.8828125,0.6328125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

The off-design behaviour of single shaft gas turbines, due to changes in turbine flow capacity, is similar to that discussed above and can be established by considering the flow compatibility equation. For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the significance of maintaining constant T3/T1 in gas turbine operation?,A2,"It allows for consistent fuel–air ratios, particularly important in DLE combustion systems for emissions control.",1.3671875,1.4765625,3.171875,1.453125,0.2109375

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What is the significance of maintaining constant T3/T1 in gas turbine operation?,A4,This practice supports the longevity of turbine components by avoiding excessive temperature fluctuations.,1.6640625,1.6328125,3.1875,1.421875,0.267578125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What role do variable geometry power turbines play in preventing compressor surge?,A1,"They adjust the power turbine area to increase the surge margin, especially during start-up and low power operations.",2.4375,2.53125,3.578125,1.46875,0.416015625

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What role do variable geometry power turbines play in preventing compressor surge?,A3,Variable geometry power turbines provide flexibility to avoid surge conditions without resorting to overboard bleeds.,1.9375,1.96875,3.296875,1.328125,0.2001953125

# Blow-off

The impact of blow-off is to reduce the flow through the turbine section relative to the compressor. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the blow-off acts at the discharge of the compressor, although in practice the blow-off will be positioned at some intermediate point, so that the choking effect of the HP stages of the compressor are reduced during low compressor speed operation.

Referring to Fig. 8.8 and writing the power balance equation for the gas generator:

ΔT21 = ΔT34 × T3 × cpg × W3 [8.6]

T1 T3 T1 cpa W1

If it is assumed that the compressor continues to operate at a constant non-dimensional speed (by adjusting the fuel flow), the non-dimensional temperature rise ΔT21/T1 will be approximately constant. When the blow-off valve is opened, W3/W1 will decrease. If it is also assumed that the turbines are choked, then from Section 8.1.2, ΔT34/T3 will also be constant. From Equation 8.6, any reduction in W3/W1 must be compensated by a corresponding increase in T3/T1, that is T3/T1 is inversely proportional to W3/W1.

Writing the flow compatibility equation for the gas generator:

W3 T3 W T P P T W

P3 = 1P1 1 × P1 × P2 × T3 × W3 [8.7]

If we assume W3√T3/P3, W1√T1/P1 and P2/P3 are approximately constant, then any reduction of W3/W1 must increase P1/P2 because the effect of the increase in T3/T1 will only be increasing by the value of its square root. Thus, during blow-off valve operation, the pressure ratio, P2/P1, for each non-dimensional speed line will decrease to satisfy the flow compatibility Equation 8.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.9, which shows the effect of blow-off valve operation on the running line on the compressor characteristic.

# Variable stator vanes and inlet guide vanes (compressors)

Variable stators (VSVs) and variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) significantly alter the flow capacity of the compressor along a given speed line. However, they do not have a significant impact on the position of the running line. The change in compressor efficiency, on the other hand, does influence the running line. Closing the stator vanes will reduce the deflection in the corresponding rotors and result in a reduction in stage loading (Section 4.10.3 in Chapter 4). This would normally increase the efficiency of the compressor. The effect of increased compressor efficiency on the non-dimensional temperature rise,

resulting in a reduction in non-dimensional temperature rise for a given non-dimensional speed, is shown in Fig. 8.10. Early work2 on variable geometry compressors using VSV/VIGVs showed an improvement in efficiency at low compressor speeds, but that a notable loss in efficiency occurs at high compressor speeds due to the closure of the VSV/VIGVs. Thus, during high-speed operation, closure of the VSV/VIGVs will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional temperature.

If the gas generator of a two-shaft gas turbine employing a free power turbine is operating at low speeds, and we assume that the change in the efficiency of the compressor due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV is small, then the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T1, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, will be unchanged due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV. Making the usual assumptions for turbines operating in series, the power balance or work compatibility in Equation 8.4 indicates that T3/T1 is constant. For a given compressor inlet non-dimensional flow, and from the flow compatibility, Equation 8.5, the compressor pressure ratio will be constant. Hence, the gas turbine power output remains constant due to VIGV/VSV closure. Therefore, these assumptions result in the operating point on the compressor characteristic remaining unaltered due to VSV/VIGV closure. However, the change in the compressor characteristic due to the closure of the VSV/VIGV will result in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional speed and thus an increase in the gas generator speed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.11, which shows the operating point on the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure. The figure also shows the change in the compressor characteristic due to VSV/VIGV closure.

# 8.11 Effect of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) closure on the engine running line and operating point on the compressor characteristic.

It has been stated that the compressor efficiency may decrease at higher compressor speeds due to the closure of the VIGV. This would indeed increase the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise which, in turn, would increase T₃/T₁ to satisfy the power balance in the gas generator. For a given compressor

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

inlet non-dimensional flow, the increase in T₃/T₁ will then increase the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁ in order to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. Hence, a loss in compressor efficiency will shift the operating line towards surge and the effects for VIGV closure and compressor efficiency loss are illustrated in Fig. 8.11. The figure shows the compressor speed is about 90% when the VIGV is opened and the speed increases to over 100% due to the closure of the VIGV. (Note: Whilst operating on a constant compressor speed line, the increase in T₃/T₁ due to a loss in compressor efficiency can indeed increase the power output of the gas turbine. But the drawback is the increased turbine creep life usage due to the higher turbine entry temperature.)

Variable stators and inlet guide vanes may also be applied to single-shaft gas turbines. Their application in single-shaft gas turbines is primarily to control the flow through the compressor. This is possible because a single-shaft gas turbine normally operates at a constant speed, thus any closure of the VSVs/VIGVs will result in a decrease in compressor flow. The control of the compressor flow by such means can result in constant turbine entry temperature operation at low powers. Considering the flow compatibility, Equation 8.1, for a constant T₃/T₁, any reduction in compressor flow and hence W₁√T₁/P₁, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus the decrease in compressor flow and pressure ratio will result in a decrease in power output and thermal efficiency.

As stated in Section 7.11, constant turbine temperature operation is quite desirable because the combustion temperature can be maintained and thus the fuel–air ratio at low power, which makes the implementation of DLE combustion easier, as discussed in Chapter 6. The incorporation of a heat exchanger/regenerator, or if the gas turbine is part of a combined cycle plant, there will be a significant improvement in the off-design thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction in compressor flows at low power, due to guide vane closure, also reduces the starting power requirements. However, the closure of these stators and VIGVs at high speeds will result in a decrease in compressor efficiency, and hence engine performance. All these effects are discussed in some detail later in the book where these issues will be illustrated using the gas turbine simulators.

# Variable nozzle guide vanes (turbines)

Choking of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) normally controls the flow capacity of a turbine. Choking of the rotor is uncommon. Thus, any change in the nozzle guide vane flow area will affect the flow capacity. Changes in the flow areas of both the NGVs and rotors will affect the efficiency of the turbine and are usually due to the change in deflections across the NGVs and rotors. Early work on the development of such turbines was carried out by Ranhk.³

# 214 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

When turbines operate in series, as in a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a power turbine, any change in the turbine flow capacity will redistribute the pressure ratios across each turbine to satisfy the flow compatibility between the turbines. Thus, the gas generator and power turbine pressure ratio will be affected and the resultant change in the work done or power output by the gas generator turbine will displace the running line of the compressor characteristic. The effect of increasing the power turbine area will increase the gas generator pressure ratio. An increase in power turbine capacity can only be satisfied by increasing the gas generator (GG) turbine exit non-dimensional flow. This is achieved by increasing the gas generator turbine pressure ratio, as illustrated in Fig. 8.12.

The increase in GG turbine work will result in an increase in the non-dimensional temperature drop across the GG turbine, ΔT₃₄/T₃. Considering the work compatibility across the gas generator, an increase in ΔT₃₄/T₃ will result in a decrease in T₃/T₁ if operation is continued on a constant compressor non-dimensional speed line, as seen by the work compatibility Equation 8.4.

Considering the flow compatibility Equation 8.5, it can be seen that the pressure ratio P₂/P₁ along a constant compressor speed line should decrease. Thus, the running line will be shifted away from the surge line in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9.

A decrease in power turbine area will therefore result in the running line being shifted towards the surge line. Also, T₃/T₁ will increase as the power turbine area is closed, so increasing the power turbine exhaust temperature. Gas turbines that employ variable geometry power turbines may increase the power turbine area during low power operations to shift the running line in.

# Behaviour of gas turbines during off-design operation

In order to prevent compressor surge during start-up and low power operating conditions. The advantage of using variable geometry power turbines is the prevention or reduction of wasteful blow-off, thus improving fuel efficiency at operating conditions where blow-off is needed to prevent compressor surge. When heat exchangers or waste heat boilers are used to recover gas turbine exhaust heat, the power turbine area may be reduced at low powers to optimise the exhaust heat recovery. They can also be used to provide substantial engine braking, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Reducing the gas generator turbine capacity will also increase the pressure ratio across the gas generator (GG) turbine as illustrated in Fig. 8.13. A reduction in the gas generator turbine flow capacity will necessarily reduce the outlet non-dimensional flow from the turbine. To maintain the same non-dimensional flow into the power turbine, the flow compatibility between the generator and power turbine will dictate an increase in the gas generator turbine pressure ratio.

The increase in gas generator turbine pressure ratio results in an increase in the GG turbine work done, or power output. The work compatibility between the GG turbine and compressor will therefore result in a reduction in T₃/T₁ as discussed above. From the flow compatibility, this reduction in T₃/T₁ will be compensated by a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, P /P . However, the reduction in the flow capacity of the GG turbine, P²  1                                                                W₃√T₃/ will require an increase in compressor pressure ratio to satisfy the flow compatibility of the gas generator. The reduction in the compressor pressure ratio, due to the reduction in T₃/T₁, will decrease only by the square root of T₃/T₁. However, the increase in compressor pressure ratio due to a decrease.

# 216 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

In GG turbine flow capacity will be inversely proportional to the reduction in GG turbine flow capacity. Generally, the net effect of a reduced GG turbine flow capacity is an increase in compressor pressure ratio. Conversely, an increase in flow capacity of the gas generator turbine will result in an increase in T₃/T₁ (i.e. the engine will run hotter), but the compressor pressure ratio will decrease.

Variable geometry GG turbines are uncommon because of the high temperatures that prevail in the GG turbine. However, such effects (change in GG turbine pressure ratios) may be experienced due to deterioration of the turbine resulting in a change in capacity and will be discussed later.

By varying either the power turbine or GG turbine flow capacity, it is possible to plot the lines of constant T₃/T₁ on the compressor characteristic, as shown in Fig. 8.14. In practice, however, variable geometry power turbines are employed, and with such devices it is possible to operate under off-design conditions at constant T₃. However, the running line will drift towards surge on the compressor characteristic. At low power (low compressor speeds), it may be necessary to increase the power turbine flow capacity to prevent surge.

Variable geometry power turbines show little or no improvement at off-design conditions over simple cycle gas turbines when operating at constant T₃ (Bareau 4). This is primarily due to the increased heat rejection at off-design conditions, which is very beneficial for a regenerative cycle. It would, however, be beneficial in DLE combustion engines using a two-shaft free power turbine configuration by maintaining a constant fuel–air ratio without incurring significant performance penalties due to overboard bleeds currently employed in such engine configurations.

For a constant T₃/T₁, any increase in the turbine flow capacity, W₃√T₃/P₃, will result in a decrease in the compressor pressure ratio P₂/P₁. Thus, the running line for a given power output will shift away from surge in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 8.9. However, with single-shaft engines, constant T₃ operation is best achieved by modulating a compressor variable inlet guide vane at off-design conditions as discussed earlier. The running line in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. ",What role do variable geometry power turbines play in preventing compressor surge?,A5,"These turbines enhance operational safety by dynamically adjusting to prevent surge, improving overall engine reliability.",1.71875,1.7421875,3.328125,1.28125,0.4296875
