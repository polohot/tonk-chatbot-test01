# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

It must be pointed out that Method 2 is unsuitable for designing gas turbines and Method 3 should be adopted.

# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the

For example, given the relative humidity of the air, the specific humidity can be calculated, as discussed in Section 2.11.1, which is the mass of water vapour per unit of dry air. Therefore, the specific humidity can be added to the composition of air as shown in Table 2.2 and air/gas composition normalised to determine the gravimetric composition of moist/humid air and then repeat the above procedure. The additional heat input required to heat the water vapour from the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, to the turbine entry temperature, T₃, needs to be calculated. This can be determined using Equation 2.68:

Hₛ = 2.232Tₛ + 2352.623                                       [2.68]

where Hₛ is the water/steam enthalpy (kJ/kg) and Tₛ is the water vapour/steam temperature in Celsius.

# 2.18.4 Summary of calculations

Table 2.4 summarises the error due to the different methods of calculating the design point performance of gas turbines. Error 1 in Table 2.4 is the percentage error between Method 1 and 3 and Error 2 is the percentage error between Method 2 and 3. Note that the first method gives the greatest error, particularly in the heat input. This is because the method of calculating the heat input pays no attention to the change in gas composition during combustion. The error using Method 2 is quite small and this is because we are calculating the heat input using combustion curves and endeavouring to adjust for the
