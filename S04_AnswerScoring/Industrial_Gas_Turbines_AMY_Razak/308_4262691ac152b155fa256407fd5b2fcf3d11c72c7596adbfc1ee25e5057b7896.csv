The simulator assumes a conventional (diffusion) combustion system, where the combustion temperature will be high and result in high NO emissions. In a DLE combustion system, these temperatures will be about 300 to 500 degrees lower, hence producing significantly lower NOₓ emissions.

The EGT is observed to remain on its set point during the period of closed loop response from the VIGV control system. The turbine entry and combustion temperature also remain approximately constant. However, during the period of open loop response, the opening of the VIGV results in a decrease in the EGT below its set point, and the largest decrease occurs at low gas turbine power output. There is therefore a significant decrease in turbine entry and combustion temperatures. This will result in the air–fuel ratio increasing during the period of open loop response, whilst the air–fuel ratio remains.

The simulator assumes a conventional (diffusion) combustion system, where the combustion temperature will be high and result in high NO emissions. In a DLE combustion system, these temperatures will be about 300 to 500 degrees lower, hence producing significantly lower NOₓ emissions.

The EGT is observed to remain on its set point during the period of closed loop response from the VIGV control system. The turbine entry and combustion temperature also remain approximately constant. However, during the period of open loop response, the opening of the VIGV results in a decrease in the EGT below its set point, and the largest decrease occurs at low gas turbine power output. There is therefore a significant decrease in turbine entry and combustion temperatures. This will result in the air–fuel ratio increasing during the period of open loop response, whilst the air–fuel ratio remains.

The simulator assumes a conventional (diffusion) combustion system, where the combustion temperature will be high and result in high NO emissions. In a DLE combustion system, these temperatures will be about 300 to 500 degrees lower, hence producing significantly lower NOₓ emissions.

The EGT is observed to remain on its set point during the period of closed loop response from the VIGV control system. The turbine entry and combustion temperature also remain approximately constant. However, during the period of open loop response, the opening of the VIGV results in a decrease in the EGT below its set point, and the largest decrease occurs at low gas turbine power output. There is therefore a significant decrease in turbine entry and combustion temperatures. This will result in the air–fuel ratio increasing during the period of open loop response, whilst the air–fuel ratio remains.
