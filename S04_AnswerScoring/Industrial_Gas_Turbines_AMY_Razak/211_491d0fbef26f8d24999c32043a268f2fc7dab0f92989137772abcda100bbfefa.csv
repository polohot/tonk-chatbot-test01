This is simulated by setting the generator power demand to 25 MW. The low power case will be simulated by setting the power demand from the generator such that an engine operating limit is never reached (low power case power demand is set to 17.5 MW).

To investigate the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance, the ambient temperature will be assumed to remain constant at 15 degrees Celsius. This will result in the engine power output being limited by the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) limit rather than by the speed limits from the gas turbine. The inlet and exhaust losses will be set to 100 mm water gauge during these.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

To investigate the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance, the ambient temperature will be assumed to remain constant at 15 degrees Celsius.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# 12.1.1 Trends in compressor characteristic and flow

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient.

Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

To investigate the impact of ambient pressure changes on engine performance, the ambient temperature will be assumed to remain constant at 15 degrees Celsius.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces.

The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient.

12.1 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during ambient pressure transient.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.

# 12.1 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance (high-power case)

During high power operation, the exhaust gas temperature limits the engine performance. Since the ambient temperature remains constant and the engine operates on the EGT limit, the ratio of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ also remains constant as the ambient pressure decreases from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar. Figure 11.6 shows the running line describing the variation of T₄ (EGT)/T₁ with the compressor non-dimensional speed, (N₁/√T₁). A constant T₄ (EGT)/ T₁, implies that the compressor non-dimensional speed will also remain constant. Thus, the non-dimensional speed of the compressor remains constant throughout the simulation. A constant compressor non-dimensional speed will mean that other engine non-dimensional parameters will remain constant throughout the simulation (see Figs 11.3 to 11.7). Hence the pressure ratios, temperature ratios, non-dimensional flows and non-dimensional power will all remain constant during the simulation.

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

12.1 Operating point on the compressor characteristic during ambient pressure transient.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

Since the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁ is constant during this transient, the compressor inlet flow W₁ decreases proportionally with P₁ due to the fall in the ambient pressure. This can be seen in Fig. 12.2, which shows the trends in flow and fuel valve position during the ambient pressure transient. The temperature rise across the combustion system and the combustion inlet temperature, T₂, also remain constant during this ambient pressure transient. Figure 2.17 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of the air–fuel ratio as a function of the combustor inlet temperature and temperature rise, indicates that the air–fuel ratio is also constant. Since the compressor airflow is decreasing, the amount of combustion air also reduces. As the air–fuel ratio is constant, a decrease in combustion airflow will result in a decrease in fuel flow as can be seen in Figure 12.2. The figure also shows the trend in the fuel valve position and this trend is similar to the trend in fuel flow.

# 12.1.2 Trends in power and thermal efficiency

As the compressor non-dimensional speed is constant during the ambient pressure transient, the non-dimensional power also remains constant. Thus any reduction in P₁ requires a corresponding reduction in power output to maintain the constant non-dimensional power and results in a lower power output (shaft and gas power) due to the decrease of ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Hence, the negative impact of low ambient pressure on maximum engine power output is illustrated, a problem often encountered by gas turbines operating at high elevations.
