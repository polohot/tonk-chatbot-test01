Calculating the work for the polytropic process involves the summation of the work for each step.

For a compression process:

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

Calculating the work for the polytropic process involves the summation of the work for each step. To calculate the work for each infinitesimal step, we use the isentropic analysis discussed in Section 2.8.2.

For a compression process:

ηp = dT′ [2.32]

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

ln⌈ T⁴ ⌉

ηp =         ⎜ T₃ ⎝ γ –1 [2.38]

The expander exit temperature is calculated from:

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

For a compressor, the isentropic efficiency is

T   – T        T₂′  – 1

ηc =   2′   1  =  T1 [2.40]

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)). ",How does 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance' explain the effect of adding more stages to a compressor on its isentropic efficiency?,A3,"The book details that more stages in a compressor elevate the pressure ratio and the disparity between polytropic and isentropic efficiencies, causing the isentropic efficiency to decline.",1.6953125,1.703125,3.421875,1.8203125,0.65625

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid.

The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)). ",How is the polytropic efficiency related to the isentropic efficiency for a compressor according to 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A3,"The book presents a formula linking ηc and ηₚ, demonstrating that for a fixed polytropic efficiency, the isentropic efficiency of a compressor declines with higher pressure ratios.",1.8984375,2.1875,3.4375,2.0,0.70703125

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

ηp = dT′ [2.32]

dT

where

dT′ is the ideal temperature rise, dT is the actual temperature rise for each step

ηₚ is now the polytropic efficiency.

For an isentropic process:

T′ = constant [2.33]

γ – 1

P γ

where P is the pressure, and

γ = cp/cv

This equation in differential form is given by

dT′ = (γ – 1) dP

T = γ × P [2.34]

Substituting dT′ from Equation 2.34 into Equation 2.32:

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

η × dT γ – 1 dP [2.35]

p T = γ × P

Integrating Equation 2.35:

γ –1

⌈ ln⌈ P₂ ⌉ ⌉ γ

⌊   ⎜ P ⎝ ⌋

ηp = ⎜        1  ⎝ [2.36]

ln ⌈ T² ⌉

⎜ T₁ ⎝

Given the polytropic efficiency and pressure ratio, the compressor discharge temperature can be calculated from:

⌈ P ⌉γ –1

T2 =      2    γ ηp [2.37]

T₁ ⎜ P₁ ⎝

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

ln⌈ T⁴ ⌉

ηp =         ⎜ T₃ ⎝ γ –1 [2.38]

⌈ ln ⌈ P₄ ⌉⌉  γ

⌊   ⎜ P ⎝⌋

⎜        3   ⎝

The expander exit temperature is calculated from:

⌈ P ⌉ ηp (γ –1)

T₄  = T₃ ⎜ P⁴  ⎝    γ [2.39]

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

For a compressor, the isentropic efficiency is

T   – T        T₂′  – 1

ηc =   2′   1  =  T1 [2.40]

T₂  – T₁      T₂  – 1

T₁

Hence,

⌈ P₂ ⌉γγ–1  – 1

ηc =  ⎜ P¹ ⎝γ –1 [2.41]

⌈ P₂ ⌉γ ηp  – 1

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

[2.42]

Hence,

ηₜ =

/ ⎜ P3 ⎝ γ –1
[2.43]

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11.

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).

Similarly, for an expansion process expanding from state 3 to 4 (expander inlet to expander exit), the polytropic efficiency is given by:

ln⌈ T⁴ ⌉

ηp =         ⎜ T₃ ⎝ γ –1 [2.38]

⌈ ln ⌈ P₄ ⌉⌉  γ

⌊   ⎜ P ⎝⌋

⎜        3   ⎝

The expander exit temperature is calculated from:

⌈ P ⌉ ηp (γ –1)

T₄  = T₃ ⎜ P⁴  ⎝    γ [2.39]

We can derive an expression relating the polytropic efficiency to the isentropic efficiency via the pressure ratio.

For a compressor, the isentropic efficiency is

T   – T        T₂′  – 1

ηc =   2′   1  =  T1 [2.40]

T₂  – T₁      T₂  – 1

T₁

Hence,

⌈ P₂ ⌉γγ–1  – 1

ηc =  ⎜ P¹ ⎝γ –1 [2.41]

⌈ P₂ ⌉γ ηp  – 1

⎜ P₁ ⎝

And for an expander, the isentropic efficiency is

ηₜ =

/ T3
[2.42]

Hence,

ηₜ =
1 – ⌈ P4 ⌉ ηᵖ (γγ –1)
/ ⎜ P3 ⎝ γ –1
[2.43]

It can be seen from Equations 2.41 and 2.43 that, for a given polytropic efficiency, the compressor isentropic efficiency decreases, whereas the turbine isentropic efficiency increases with increase in pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, where the polytropic efficiency of the compressor and turbine is assumed to be 0.87. During the compression process, as defined by a polytropic path, there is an increase in the inlet temperature to each compression stage due to irreversibility (degradation) in the previous stage, thus resulting in increased compressor work demand. However, in a turbine this increase in temperature will be recovered partly by the expansion in the next turbine stage and this explains the different trends in the isentropic efficiencies for the compressor and turbine, as shown in Fig. 2.11. Note that the isentropic

efficiency tends to the polytropic efficiency as the pressure ratio tends to unity.

To analyse the polytropic efficiency further, let us consider an axial compressor comprising three stages increasing the pressure from P₁ to P₄, as shown in Fig. 2.12. It will be assumed that the pressure ratio in each state is small enough, such that the path described by each stage is polytropic. Furthermore, it will also be assumed that the isentropic efficiency of each stage is equal and would now be the polytropic efficiency ηₚ due to the small stage pressure ratio.

The stage temperature rise is given by ΔTₛ = ΔTₛ′ / ηₚ where ΔTₛ′ is the ideal stage temperature rise. The total temperature rise across the compressor would therefore be ΔT = 1/ηₚ × ΔTₛ′. However, ΔT = ΔT′/ηₖ, where ηₖ is the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Thus ηₚ / ηₖ = ΔTₛ′ / ΔT′. Since lines of constant pressure diverge on the temperature–entropy diagram, ΔTₛ′ will be greater than ΔT′. Hence ηₚ will be greater than ηₖ for the compression process as discussed in Saravanamuttoo et al.³

If more stages are added to the compressor, then the difference between these two efficiencies will also increase. However, the increase in the number of stages will also increase the pressure ratio of the compressor. Thus the decrease in compressor isentropic efficiency with pressure ratio is observed as shown in Fig. 2.11.

Similarly, it can be shown that, for a turbine, the isentropic efficiency will increase with pressure ratio and this is due to the reheating of the gas entering the next turbine stage due to the losses in the previous stage.

# 2.9 Effect of irreversibility on the performance of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine

It has been shown that, for an ideal simple cycle gas turbine, the thermal efficiency is dependent only on the pressure ratio and the working fluid. When irreversibilities are present, the thermal efficiency is also dependent on the cycle temperatures, namely the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature, T₃/T₁.

Figure 2.13(a) shows a gas turbine cycle on a temperature–entropy diagram, when irreversibilities are present and no heat addition is assumed (1,2,3,4). The turbine work output will be less than the compressor work absorbed, resulting in a negative net work output from the cycle. This implies that energy has to be provided to sustain the cycle and the amount of energy needed corresponds to cₚ(T₄ – T₁) to make the cycle self-sustaining.

If enough heat is supplied such that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the compressor (cₚ(T₃ – T₄) = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)), the net work output and the thermal efficiency will be zero because a finite amount of heat has to be supplied (Fig. 2.13(b)).
