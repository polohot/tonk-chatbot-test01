# 10.4.1 Control of variable geometry compressor in free power turbine engines

Gas turbines employing free power turbines and operating with high compressor pressure ratios require variable geometry compressors in the form of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) and stators (VSVs) to achieve satisfactory compressor surge margins as was discussed in Chapter 4. The operation of these devices results in the turning or rotating of the variable guide vanes via an actuator ring connected to a piston or ramp. Air or hydraulic pressure is applied to the ramp resulting in turning of the VIGVs and VSVs. The amount of turning of these devices is normally determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and these variable guide vanes open as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. This process is shown in Fig. 10.9.

Early gas turbines, many of which are still in operation today, use an open loop system to actuate the variable guide vane. In other words, the amount of pressure applied to actuate the variable guide vanes is predetermined effectively by the value of the compressor non-dimensional speed. Although they generally operate satisfactorily, the control system performance is susceptible to wear and dirt in the guide vane and actuator system. As a result, such control systems seldom achieve the required guide vane angle (set point). Current gas turbines employ a closed loop system thus cancelling out any errors.

Gas turbines employing free power turbines and operating with high compressor pressure ratios require variable geometry compressors in the form of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) and stators (VSVs) to achieve satisfactory compressor surge margins as was discussed in Chapter 4. The operation of these devices results in the turning or rotating of the variable guide vanes via an actuator ring connected to a piston or ramp.

The amount of turning of these devices is normally determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and these variable guide vanes open as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. This process is shown in Fig. 10.9.

Early gas turbines, many of which are still in operation today, use an open loop system to actuate the variable guide vane. In other words, the amount of pressure applied to actuate the variable guide vanes is predetermined effectively by the value of the compressor non-dimensional speed. Although they generally operate satisfactorily, the control system performance is susceptible to wear and dirt in the guide vane and actuator system.

# 10.4.1 Control of variable geometry compressor in free power turbine engines

Gas turbines employing free power turbines and operating with high compressor pressure ratios require variable geometry compressors in the form of variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) and stators (VSVs) to achieve satisfactory compressor surge margins as was discussed in Chapter 4. The operation of these devices results in the turning or rotating of the variable guide vanes via an actuator ring connected to a piston or ramp. Air or hydraulic pressure is applied to the ramp resulting in turning of the VIGVs and VSVs. The amount of turning of these devices is normally determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed, and these variable guide vanes open as the compressor non-dimensional speed increases. This process is shown in Fig. 10.9.

Early gas turbines, many of which are still in operation today, use an open loop system to actuate the variable guide vane. In other words, the amount of pressure applied to actuate the variable guide vanes is predetermined effectively by the value of the compressor non-dimensional speed. Although they generally operate satisfactorily, the control system performance is susceptible to wear and dirt in the guide vane and actuator system. As a result, such control systems seldom achieve the required guide vane angle (set point). Current gas turbines employ a closed loop system thus cancelling out any errors.
