Given the compressor geometry (flow area), using the equation of state and the continuity equation, the axial velocity, Va, and blade velocity, U, at the reference point can be calculated (e.g. blade mid-height). Thus the flow coefficient, Va/U, can be determined. Using the stage characteristic and by interpolation, the stage loading coefficient, Δh/U², and the isentropic efficiency can be determined.

The forcing term, *Fnet, for transition ducts and combustors can be determined by Equation 7.6 in Chapter 7. This equation gives the non-dimensional pressure loss across the combustor. For transition ducts, the temperature rise is zero. Therefore, the Fnet* term is simply the pressure loss across the transition duct or combustor.

The energy term, *Enet, is zero for transition ducts because a thermodynamic process in such components is considered as adiabatic with no work transfer. However, for combustors the *Enet* term is calculated by the instantaneous flow, mf, times the lower heating value of the fuel, LHV*. The work transfer for combustors is zero. Thus for combustors:

*Enet = mf × LHV* [10.30]

# Transition ducts and combustors

The forcing term, *Fnet, for transition ducts and combustors can be determined by Equation 7.6 in Chapter 7. This equation gives the non-dimensional pressure loss across the combustor. For transition ducts, the temperature rise is zero. Therefore, the Fnet* term is simply the pressure loss across the transition duct or combustor.

The energy term, *Enet, is zero for transition ducts because a thermodynamic process in such components is considered as adiabatic with no work transfer. However, for combustors the *Enet* term is calculated by the instantaneous flow, mf, times the lower heating value of the fuel, LHV*. The work transfer for combustors is zero. Thus for combustors:

*Enet = mf × LHV* [10.30]

However, for combustors the *Enet* term is calculated by the instantaneous flow, mf, times the lower heating value of the fuel, LHV*. The work transfer for combustors is zero. Thus for combustors:

*Enet = mf × LHV* [10.30]

Given the compressor geometry (flow area), using the equation of state and the continuity equation, the axial velocity, Va, and blade velocity, U, at the reference point can be calculated (e.g. blade mid-height). Thus the flow coefficient, Va/U, can be determined. Using the stage characteristic and by interpolation, the stage loading coefficient, Δh/U², and the isentropic efficiency can be determined. Δh is the specific enthalpy rise.

The stage pressure ratio, P2/P1 can now be calculated from

Δh = cT ⌈ pr γ–1 ⌉ η

⌊ γ – 1 / p1 ⎜ ⌋ c ,

which will yield the compressor stage pressure ratio. cp is the specific heat at constant pressure, γ is the isentropic index, T1 is the stage inlet temperature and ηc is the stage isentropic efficiency. Note that pressures and temperatures are now assumed to be stagnation or total values.

The Fnₑₜ term is defined as the pressure change (rise) across the compressor stage and is therefore given by:

Fnₑₜ = P2 – P1

in terms of the stage pressure ratio:

Fnₑₜ = P1(pr – 1)                                              [10.29]

Since the compression process is assumed to be adiabatic, the Enₑₜ term is equal to the rise in enthalpy, Δh × W1, where W1 is the inlet compressor flow rate.

# Engine control systems and transient performance

# Transition ducts and combustors

The forcing term, *Fnet, for transition ducts and combustors can be determined by Equation 7.6 in Chapter 7. This equation gives the non-dimensional pressure loss across the combustor. For transition ducts, the temperature rise is zero. Therefore, the Fnet* term is simply the pressure loss across the transition duct or combustor.

The energy term, *Enet, is zero for transition ducts because a thermodynamic process in such components is considered as adiabatic with no work transfer. However, for combustors the *Enet* term is calculated by the instantaneous flow, mf, times the lower heating value of the fuel, LHV*. The work transfer for combustors is zero. Thus for combustors:

*Enet = mf × LHV* [10.30]
