18.34 Trends in gas turbine emissions due to hot end damage when operating at high power.

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",How does hot end damage affect the compressor and turbine non-dimensional flow capacities?,A1,Hot end damage increases both the compressor and turbine non-dimensional flow capacities.,1.2109375,1.671875,3.390625,1.125,-0.1025390625

The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",How does the mass flow rate through the engine change with hot end damage?,A2,"Hot end damage leads to a higher mass flow rate, as the compressor non-dimensional flow increases with VIGV adjustment.",0.875,0.921875,3.1875,1.21875,0.26171875

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",How does the opening of the VIGV affect the compressor efficiency?,A3,VIGV opening enhances compressor efficiency by adjusting the operating point to a higher efficiency region.,1.65625,1.75,3.171875,1.25,0.271484375

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

18.36 Trends in pressure and temperature ratios due to hot end damage when operating at low power with active VIGV operation.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",How does the power demand from the generator affect the simulation of gas turbine operation?,A4,"The scenario simulates a 35 MW power demand, under the maximum available from the gas turbine.",1.2421875,1.0625,3.0,1.2734375,0.21484375

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",What is the effect of hot end damage on the EGT and VIGV in gas turbines?,A2,"The VIGV opens as a result of increased EGT from hot end damage, keeping the EGT at the set point.",1.34375,1.40625,3.25,1.1953125,0.328125

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",What is the impact of hot end damage on turbine efficiency?,A3,The efficiency of the turbine drops due to the effects of hot end damage.,1.2421875,1.1953125,3.09375,1.0078125,0.05419921875

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.

18.36 Trends in pressure and temperature ratios due to hot end damage when operating at low power with active VIGV operation.

# 18.5.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The increase in the compressor flow results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. The turbine power output also increases to satisfy the work compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when operating at a fixed power demand from the generator. The compressor efficiency increases due to the opening of the VIGV, where the operating point on the compressor characteristic corresponds to a higher efficiency, as explained in Section 16.3.3. The decrease in the turbine efficiency is due to hot end damage (see Fig. ",What is the significance of the compressor characteristic in simulating hot end damage?,A4,Understanding the compressor characteristic is key to simulating the effects of hot end damage and VIGV changes.,1.234375,1.2109375,2.796875,1.1796875,-0.1318359375

# 18.5.1 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratio

The increase in the EGT due to hot end damage results in the opening of the VIGV, such that the EGT remains on the EGT limit, which is also the set point for the VIGV control system, during this simulation. The opening of the VIGV results in an increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow capacity. The effect of hot end damage also results in an increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. The increase in the turbine non-dimensional flow is almost compensated by the increase in the compressor non-dimensional flow due to the opening of the VIGV. As a result, only a small change (increase) in the compressor pressure ratio is needed to satisfy the flow compatibility between the compressor and turbine. This can be seen in Fig. 18.35, which shows the operating points on the compressor characteristic during the simulation of hot end damage. Furthermore, the change in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, a slight decrease is observed in the trend of T3/T1, is also small, although as shown in Fig. 18.36. This is due to the increase in mass flow rate through the engine, resulting from the increase in compressor non-dimensional flow (due to the opening of the VIGV), thus compensating for the loss in specific work due to hot end damage. Figure 18.36 also shows the changes in compressor and turbine pressure ratios and, as stated, there are only small increases in these pressure ratios.
