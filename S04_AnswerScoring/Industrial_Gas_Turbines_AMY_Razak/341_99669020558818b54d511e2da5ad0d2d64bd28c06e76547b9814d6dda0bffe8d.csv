Determine the percentage increase in generator power output using wetted media, fogging and chillers (COP = 5) when the relative humidity is 20% and 90%. What parameter limits the power output of the gas turbine for each of these relative humidity cases? Ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius.

# 73.

When using chillers for turbine inlet cooling, optimise the power turbine capacity for maximum power output based on EGT limit rather than GG speed limit. Comment on the turbine creep-life usage due to optimising the capacity of the power turbine. The ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity is 20%.

Determine the maximum generator power output, turbine inlet cooling, percentage increase in generator power output and thermal efficiency when applying turbine inlet cooling (the ambient temperature is 35 degrees Celsius) using:

- wetted media
- fogging
- chillers (coefficient of performance (COP) = 5).

Comment on the change in gas turbine emissions. If the effectiveness of the wetted media is increased to 0.95, what is the turbine inlet cooling, increased power output and thermal efficiency for this case? The increase in the effectiveness of the wetted media also results in an increased inlet loss of 50 mm water gauge. Comment on the profit using each of the turbine inlet cooling technologies.
