# 170 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Natural gas fired gas turbines and it has been tested on various gas turbines whose power output varied from 1.5 MW to 35 MW. The correlation is:

NOₓ = 18.1P1.42ma0.3f0.72 [6.16]

where

- P is the combustion pressure in atmospheres
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

# Gas turbine combustion

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

# 170 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Natural gas fired gas turbines and it has been tested on various gas turbines whose power output varied from 1.5 MW to 35 MW. The correlation is:

NOₓ = 18.1P1.42ma0.3f0.72 [6.16]

where

- P is the combustion pressure in atmospheres
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and

- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

[6.21]

where

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

# Gas turbine combustion

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

# Gas turbine combustion

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

# 170 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Natural gas fired gas turbines and it has been tested on various gas turbines whose power output varied from 1.5 MW to 35 MW. The correlation is:

NOₓ = 18.1P1.42ma0.3f0.72 [6.16]

where

- P is the combustion pressure in atmospheres
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

# Gas turbine combustion

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and

- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

# 170 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Natural gas fired gas turbines and it has been tested on various gas turbines whose power output varied from 1.5 MW to 35 MW. The correlation is:

NOₓ = 18.1P1.42ma0.3f0.72 [6.16]

where

- P is the combustion pressure in atmospheres
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

# Gas turbine combustion

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and

- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

# 170 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Natural gas fired gas turbines and it has been tested on various gas turbines whose power output varied from 1.5 MW to 35 MW. The correlation is:

NOₓ = 18.1P1.42ma0.3f0.72 [6.16]

where

- P is the combustion pressure in atmospheres
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

# 6.18.2 CO correlations

A correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:

CO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)

[6.20]

where

- Vc is the combustion volume, m3
- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K

CO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

CO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5

[6.21]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and

# 6.18.3 UHC correlation

Correlations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:

UHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6

[6.22]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

# 170 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

Natural gas fired gas turbines and it has been tested on various gas turbines whose power output varied from 1.5 MW to 35 MW. The correlation is:

NOₓ = 18.1P1.42ma0.3f0.72 [6.16]

where

- P is the combustion pressure in atmospheres
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Although the combustion temperature term is absent in this correlation, it is represented by the fuel–air ratio term.

The following correlation is due to Rizk and Mongia12 and is given by:

NOₓ = 0.15 × 1016(t – te)0.5exp – (71 000/ Tst)/P0.05(ΔP/P)0.5 [6.17]

where

- t is the residence time in seconds and
- te is the evaporation time in seconds
- P is the combustion pressure, kPa
- Tst is the stoichiometric temperature, K

NOₓ is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.

This correlation is similar to that proposed by Lefebvre.

A correlation proposed and validated by Sullivan13 is given by Equation 6.18:

NOₓ = Anₒₓ × P0.5f1.4ma–0.22exp(Tc/250) [6.18]

where

- Anₒₓ is a reference parameter reflecting the combustor geometry
- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, K
- f is the fuel–air ratio
- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

Bakken and Skogly14 proposed a similar correlation developed for natural gas fired gas turbines, as given by Equation 6.19.

NOₓ = 62 P0.5f1.4exp – (635/Tc) [6.19]

where

- P is the combustion pressure, Pa
- Tc is the combustion temperature, °C
- f is the fuel–air ratio

NOₓ is given in ppmv at 15% O2 dry.

According to Bakken, the parameters should be corrected to standard condition (15 °C and 1.013 Bar). This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.

The following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:

[6.22]

where

# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂

The equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:

CxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]

where

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.

The equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:

n1 = x<br />
n2 = 0.5y<br />
n = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y

Substituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:

CxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]

Therefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:

1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]

or

1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]

Values of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.

If 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.

In practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)
