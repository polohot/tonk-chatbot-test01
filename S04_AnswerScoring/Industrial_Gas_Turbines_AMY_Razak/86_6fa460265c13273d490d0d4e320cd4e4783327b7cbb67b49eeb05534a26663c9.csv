The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

φ = ( FAR    =  m                                            [6.7]

FAR)ₛ     ms

For lean mixtures, the equivalence ratio will be less than one and for rich mixtures the equivalence ratio will be greater than one. Fuel–air ratios corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio have an equivalence ratio of one.

Figure 6.2 shows the adiabatic flame temperature for CH₄ varying with equivalence ratio. The figure also shows the deviation of the actual adiabatic flame temperature from the theoretical value due to the effects of dissociation. Note the maximum actual adiabatic flame temperature occurs at slightly rich mixtures (e.g. φ = 1.05). The adiabatic temperature for higher carbon content fuels will be higher and the equivalence ratio where the maximum adiabatic flame temperature occurs also increases. Goodger¹ gives more details on the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

In practice, there is always some heat transfer and the temperature achieved during combustion is always less than the true adiabatic flame temperature.

At flame temperatures above 1800 K, products of combustion may dissociate to form radicals and species. These reactions absorb energy (endothermic) and will further suppress the flame temperature. When comparing the flame temperature of different fuels, it is convenient to work with equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratio, φ, is defined as:

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

In practice, there is always some heat transfer and the temperature achieved during combustion is always less than the true adiabatic flame temperature.

At flame temperatures above 1800 K, products of combustion may dissociate to form radicals and species. These reactions absorb energy (endothermic) and will further suppress the flame temperature. When comparing the flame temperature of different fuels, it is convenient to work with equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratio, φ, is defined as:

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

When comparing the flame temperature of different fuels, it is convenient to work with equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratio, φ, is defined as:

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle

4. intermediate zone

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.

At flame temperatures above 1800 K, products of combustion may dissociate to form radicals and species. These reactions absorb energy (endothermic) and will further suppress the flame temperature. When comparing the flame temperature of different fuels, it is convenient to work with equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratio, φ, is defined as:

φ = ( FAR    =  m                                            [6.7]

FAR)ₛ     ms

For lean mixtures, the equivalence ratio will be less than one and for rich mixtures the equivalence ratio will be greater than one. Fuel–air ratios corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio have an equivalence ratio of one.

Figure 6.2 shows the adiabatic flame temperature for CH₄ varying with equivalence ratio. The figure also shows the deviation of the actual adiabatic flame temperature from the theoretical value due to the effects of dissociation. Note the maximum actual adiabatic flame temperature occurs at slightly rich mixtures (e.g. φ = 1.05). The adiabatic temperature for higher carbon content fuels will be higher and the equivalence ratio where the maximum adiabatic flame temperature occurs also increases. Goodger¹ gives more details on the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels.

The gas turbine combustion system consists of the following regions and components:

1. diffuser
2. fuel nozzle
3. primary zone
4. intermediate zone
5. dilution zone.

These regions are shown in Fig. 6.3, which is a schematic representation of a gas turbine combustion system.

# 6.2.1 Diffuser

The function of the diffuser is to reduce the flow velocity sufficiently to help start the combustion process. Fuel is burnt in the compressor discharge air, which has a velocity of about 200 m/s. Apart from the significant combustion problems of burning fuel in such a high velocity air stream, the pressure loss in the combustor will be excessive, resulting in poor gas turbine performance. The velocity of the compressor exit air velocity must be reduced and this is achieved by the use of a diffuser.

A simple diffuser is essentially a straight-walled, divergent duct as shown in Fig. 6.4 where the air velocity is reduced resulting in an increase in static pressure. The function of the diffuser is to reduce the compressor exit air velocity to about a fifth of its initial value. For a given area ratio, the length of the diffuser has a big impact on the diffuser performance. If a diffuser is too long, the pressure loss increases due to frictional effects. If too short, the decelerating flow (adverse pressure gradient) will separate and stall, causing higher pressure losses. The effect of length on diffuser performance is illustrated in Fig. 6.5 and there is a specific length which corresponds to the minimum loss. The objective of the diffuser is to achieve the diffusion in the shortest possible length, incurring the lowest pressure loss.

One diffuser design that has found favour particularly in aero-engine application is the vortex-controlled diffuser (VCD) which is shown in Fig. 6.6.

A VCD achieves good diffusion in a short length by bleeding controlled amounts of air from the compressor discharge so that a vortex is generated and the resultant streamlines essentially act as the diffuser surface. About 80% of the theoretical static pressure rise is possible, thus reducing the velocity of the combustion air, but a significant bleed is required, which amounts to about 4% of the total flow. This bleed can be used for engine cooling purposes and therefore may not present a significant penalty.
