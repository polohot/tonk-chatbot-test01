Elling’s gas turbine was very similar to Frank Whittle’s jet engine, which was patented in 1930 in England. Whittle’s design also consisted of a centrifugal compressor and an axial turbine and the engine was subsequently tested in April 1937. Meanwhile, in 1936, Hans von Ohain and Max Hahn, in Germany, developed and patented their own design. Unlike Frank Whittle’s design, von Ohain’s engine employed a centrifugal compressor and turbine placed very close together, back to back. The work by both Whittle and Ohain effectively started the gas turbine industry.

Today, gas turbines are used widely in various industries to produce mechanical power and are employed to drive various loads such as generators, pumps, process compressors, or a propeller. The gas turbine began as a relatively simple engine and evolved into a complex but reliable and high efficiency prime mover. The performance and satisfactory operation of gas turbines are of paramount importance to the profitability of industries, varying from civil and military aviation to power generation, and also oil and gas exploration and production.

In the quest to perfect the gas turbine, compressor pressure ratios have increased from about 4:1 to over 40:1 together with high operating temperatures.

(about 1800 K), resulting in thermal efficiencies exceeding 40%. These features make the gas turbine a formidable competitor to other types of prime movers. In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

# 1.2 Gas turbine layouts

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

# 1.2 Gas turbine layouts

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

Elling’s gas turbine was very similar to Frank Whittle’s jet engine, which was patented in 1930 in England. Whittle’s design also consisted of a centrifugal compressor and an axial turbine and the engine was subsequently tested in April 1937. Meanwhile, in 1936, Hans von Ohain and Max Hahn, in Germany, developed and patented their own design. Unlike Frank Whittle’s design, von Ohain’s engine employed a centrifugal compressor and turbine placed very close together, back to back. The work by both Whittle and Ohain effectively started the gas turbine industry.

Today, gas turbines are used widely in various industries to produce mechanical power and are employed to drive various loads such as generators, pumps, process compressors, or a propeller. The gas turbine began as a relatively simple engine and evolved into a complex but reliable and high efficiency prime mover. The performance and satisfactory operation of gas turbines are of paramount importance to the profitability of industries, varying from civil and military aviation to power generation, and also oil and gas exploration and production.

In the quest to perfect the gas turbine, compressor pressure ratios have increased from about 4:1 to over 40:1 together with high operating temperatures.

(about 1800 K), resulting in thermal efficiencies exceeding 40%. These features make the gas turbine a formidable competitor to other types of prime movers. In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

(about 1800 K), resulting in thermal efficiencies exceeding 40%. These features make the gas turbine a formidable competitor to other types of prime movers. In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

# 1.2 Gas turbine layouts

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

Elling’s gas turbine was very similar to Frank Whittle’s jet engine, which was patented in 1930 in England. Whittle’s design also consisted of a centrifugal compressor and an axial turbine and the engine was subsequently tested in April 1937. Meanwhile, in 1936, Hans von Ohain and Max Hahn, in Germany, developed and patented their own design. Unlike Frank Whittle’s design, von Ohain’s engine employed a centrifugal compressor and turbine placed very close together, back to back.

In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

The work by both Whittle and Ohain effectively started the gas turbine industry.

Today, gas turbines are used widely in various industries to produce mechanical power and are employed to drive various loads such as generators, pumps, process compressors, or a propeller. The gas turbine began as a relatively simple engine and evolved into a complex but reliable and high efficiency prime mover. The performance and satisfactory operation of gas turbines are of paramount importance to the profitability of industries, varying from civil and military aviation to power generation, and also oil and gas exploration and production.

In the quest to perfect the gas turbine, compressor pressure ratios have increased from about 4:1 to over 40:1 together with high operating temperatures.

(about 1800 K), resulting in thermal efficiencies exceeding 40%. These features make the gas turbine a formidable competitor to other types of prime movers. In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

# 1.2 Gas turbine layouts

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load).

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

# 1.2 Gas turbine layouts

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

A single-shaft gas turbine consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1. ",What was the operating speed of the engine mentioned in the text?,A4,"The text states the engine's operating speed was around 20,000 rpm.",0.54296875,0.69140625,3.609375,0.6796875,0.349609375

Elling’s gas turbine was very similar to Frank Whittle’s jet engine, which was patented in 1930 in England. Whittle’s design also consisted of a centrifugal compressor and an axial turbine and the engine was subsequently tested in April 1937. Meanwhile, in 1936, Hans von Ohain and Max Hahn, in Germany, developed and patented their own design. Unlike Frank Whittle’s design, von Ohain’s engine employed a centrifugal compressor and turbine placed very close together, back to back. The work by both Whittle and Ohain effectively started the gas turbine industry.

Today, gas turbines are used widely in various industries to produce mechanical power and are employed to drive various loads such as generators, pumps, process compressors, or a propeller. The gas turbine began as a relatively simple engine and evolved into a complex but reliable and high efficiency prime mover. The performance and satisfactory operation of gas turbines are of paramount importance to the profitability of industries, varying from civil and military aviation to power generation, and also oil and gas exploration and production.

In the quest to perfect the gas turbine, compressor pressure ratios have increased from about 4:1 to over 40:1 together with high operating temperatures.

In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

Elling’s gas turbine was very similar to Frank Whittle’s jet engine, which was patented in 1930 in England. Whittle’s design also consisted of a centrifugal compressor and an axial turbine and the engine was subsequently tested in April 1937. Meanwhile, in 1936, Hans von Ohain and Max Hahn, in Germany, developed and patented their own design. Unlike Frank Whittle’s design, von Ohain’s engine employed a centrifugal compressor and turbine placed very close together, back to back. The work by both Whittle and Ohain effectively started the gas turbine industry.

Today, gas turbines are used widely in various industries to produce mechanical power and are employed to drive various loads such as generators, pumps, process compressors, or a propeller. The gas turbine began as a relatively simple engine and evolved into a complex but reliable and high efficiency prime mover. The performance and satisfactory operation of gas turbines are of paramount importance to the profitability of industries, varying from civil and military aviation to power generation, and also oil and gas exploration and production.

In the quest to perfect the gas turbine, compressor pressure ratios have increased from about 4:1 to over 40:1 together with high operating temperatures.

(about 1800 K), resulting in thermal efficiencies exceeding 40%. These features make the gas turbine a formidable competitor to other types of prime movers. In increasing the performance of the gas turbine, various engine configurations have evolved and such engine component arrangements and their applications will be discussed. However, the principles of the gas turbine and the main components that are required for these engines will be discussed first.

# 1.1 The gas turbine

For a turbine to produce power, it must have a higher inlet pressure than that at the exit. A compressor is normally used to provide this increase in pressure into the turbine. If the compressor discharge flow through the turbine is expanded, the turbine power output will be less than the power absorbed by the compressor because of losses in the compressor and turbine. Under these conditions, the whole engine will cease to rotate.

If energy is added into the compressor discharge air, corresponding to the losses in the compressor and turbine, then the system will run but will not produce any net power output. To produce net power from the gas turbine, additional energy needs to be supplied into the compressor discharge air. The energy supplied to the compressor discharge air is normally achieved by burning fuel in the compressor discharge air and this is accomplished in a combustion chamber or combustor, which is located or positioned between the compressor and turbine as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Clearly, the power output from a gas turbine depends on the efficiency of the compressor, turbine and the combustor. The higher the efficiency of these components, the better will be the performance of the gas turbine, resulting in increased power output and thermal efficiency.

The gas turbine has developed over 50 years into a high efficiency prime mover, and compressor and turbine efficiencies (polytropic) above 90% can be achieved today.

# Introduction

From the above discussion, a gas turbine must therefore have at least the following components:

1. compressor
2. combustor
3. turbine.

A gas turbine comprising these components is often referred to as a simple cycle gas turbine. Gas turbines can include other components, such as intercoolers to reduce the compression power absorbed, re-heaters to increase the turbine power output and heat exchangers to reduce the heat input. These types of gas turbines are referred to as complex cycles. Although such complex cycles were developed in the early days of the gas turbine, today, simple cycle gas turbines dominate, and this is due to the high levels of performance achieved by engine components such the compressor, turbine and combustor. However, there is a renewed interest in complex cycle designs as a means of improving the performance of the gas turbine further.

# 1.2 Gas turbine layouts

Various arrangements of the gas turbine components have evolved over the years. Some are better suited for certain applications such as power generation (constant speed operation of the load, i.e. the generator) and other layouts are more suited to mechanical drive applications where the gas turbine is used to drive a process compressor or a pump (where the speed of the driven equipment can vary with load). In this section, we shall discuss these various arrangements, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.
