# 18.4.5 Trends in flow

Since the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation, the compressor non-dimensional flow also essentially remains constant. As the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, there is little change in the compressor airflow rate due to hot end damage, as shown in Fig. 18.32. As a result, the combustion air flow also remains essentially constant. The loss in power output due to hot end damage is greater than the loss in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a

Since the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation, the compressor non-dimensional flow also essentially remains constant. As the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, there is little change in the compressor airflow rate due to hot end damage, as shown in Fig. 18.32. As a result, the combustion air flow also remains essentially constant. The loss in power output due to hot end damage is greater than the loss in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a

Since the compressor non-dimensional speed remains constant during this simulation, the compressor non-dimensional flow also essentially remains constant. As the compressor inlet temperature and pressure remain constant, there is little change in the compressor airflow rate due to hot end damage, as shown in Fig. 18.32. As a result, the combustion air flow also remains essentially constant. The loss in power output due to hot end damage is greater than the loss in the gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a
