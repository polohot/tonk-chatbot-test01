Such low speed operation is usually at engine idle conditions and is of little importance. It is the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic that is important, as it is here that the engine spends most of its operating time and fouling effects are greatest. An excellent description of the effects of fouling on the compressor characteristic using computer simulations is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 4

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

with inlet non-dimensional flow remains unaffected by other performance-related faults and is due to the steep flow line for a given non-dimensional speed. However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance. Online washing seems to be an effective method in combating fouling, but there are

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

Such low speed operation is usually at engine idle conditions and is of little importance. It is the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic that is important, as it is here that the engine spends most of its operating time and fouling effects are greatest. An excellent description of the effects of fouling on the compressor characteristic using computer simulations is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 4

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

with inlet non-dimensional flow remains unaffected by other performance-related faults and is due to the steep flow line for a given non-dimensional speed. However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance. Online washing seems to be an effective method in combating fouling, but there are

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance. Online washing seems to be an effective method in combating fouling, but there are

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance. Online washing seems to be an effective method in combating fouling, but there are

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

It is the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic that is important, as it is here that the engine spends most of its operating time and fouling effects are greatest.

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

Such low speed operation is usually at engine idle conditions and is of little importance. It is the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic that is important, as it is here that the engine spends most of its operating time and fouling effects are greatest. An excellent description of the effects of fouling on the compressor characteristic using computer simulations is given in Saravanamutoo and Lakshmiranasimha. 4

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed

with inlet non-dimensional flow remains unaffected by other performance-related faults and is due to the steep flow line for a given non-dimensional speed. However, a measurement of the compressor flow is required and the accurate measurement of the compressor inlet flow on engines operating out in the field has yet to be achieved. The use of inlet depression measurements as an indication of compressor flow has been used by Diakunchak5 to detect compressor fouling. Figure 9.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed due to compressor fouling.

Performance deterioration due to compressor fouling is often recoverable after a compressor wash. The factors that determine when it is economical to wash the compressor are many. They include power demand, fuel cost, down-time for wash (and may include emissions taxes, e.g. CO2). It is necessary to determine accurately the cost of compressor fouling, i.e. loss in power and increased heat rate, which can then determine the increase in operating cost (fuel cost) and lost revenue. A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

A general strategy is to increase the wash frequency when power demand is high and decrease it at low power demands because, at low power demands, no loss in production should occur because the engine is not on a power limit under low power conditions. However, there will be an increase in fuel cost, but in applications where fuel cost is low or even zero, such as in oil and gas exploration and production, washes may be delayed significantly. Should emissions taxes be imposed, particularly on CO2 emissions, the fuel cost in these industries will no longer be insignificant and optimising compressor washes will be of paramount importance.

# 9.2 Variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vane (VSV) problems

Multi-shaft free turbine gas turbines operating at high-pressure ratios often use variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators to ensure satisfactory and safe operation of the compressor, particularly at low speeds. The positions of the VIGV and VSV are normally functions of the compressor non-dimensional speed and Figure 9.8 shows the variation of the VIGV/VSV angle with non-dimensional speed. A region where operation is not possible is also shown, as compressor surge is very likely in this region. Any deviation of the operating point from the operating line (during steady-state operation) would imply a fault with the VIGV/VSV system.

In Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors, the effect of VIGV and VSV on the compressor characteristic has been discussed. Closure of the VIGV will result in the non-dimensional flow decreasing and improving the surge margin. Thus, excessive closure of the VIGV/VSV will result in

vanes (compressors)’ the impact of improved compressor efficiency on the running line was discussed. It was shown that an improvement in the compressor efficiency moves the running line on the compressor characteristic away from surge (two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free-power turbine). When compressors foul, there is a loss of compressor efficiency, thus shifting the running line towards surge and reducing the surge margin, as illustrated in Fig. 9.5.

Since the change or reduction in flow capacity is usually greater than the effect on compressor efficiency, the compressor pressure ratio decreases with compressor fouling for a given compressor non-dimensional speed and this situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.

Although measuring the change in compressor pressure ratio with compressor non-dimensional speed gives an indication of compressor fouling, care is necessary as other performance-related faults can also influence the change in compressor ratio with non-dimensional speed. For instance, any change in the turbine areas can also give rise to a displacement in the running line and thus alter the relationship between the compressor pressure ratio and its non-dimensional speed. This has been illustrated in Section 8.2 ‘Displacement of running line (two-shaft gas turbine)’.

A better indication of compressor fouling can be obtained by plotting the variation of compressor non-dimensional speed with compressor inlet non-dimensional flow. The variation of the compressor non-dimensional speed
