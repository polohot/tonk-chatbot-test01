# 19.3 Power augmentation using water injection

The power output of a single-shaft gas turbine may also be augmented by the use of water injection. The water may be injected either at the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. As discussed earlier, power augmentation by injecting water into the compressor inlet occurs due to the suppression of the compressor inlet temperature, and the amount of compressor inlet temperature suppression depends on the humidity of the air at the inlet of the compressor (wetted media and inlet fogging).

The case of direct water injection into the combustion system will be considered where the increase in power output is a result of the increased mass flow rate through the turbine, relative to that through the compressor. The limit on the increase in power is normally governed by the increase in

CO and UHC emissions due to the chilling of the flame in the primary zone. There is also an adverse effect on the turbine blade creep life usage, which must be taken into consideration.

# Figure 19.12

shows the increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection where the water–fuel ratio is unity. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

The power output of a single-shaft gas turbine may also be augmented by the use of water injection. The water may be injected either at the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. As discussed earlier, power augmentation by injecting water into the compressor inlet occurs due to the suppression of the compressor inlet temperature, and the amount of compressor inlet temperature suppression depends on the humidity of the air at the inlet of the compressor (wetted media and inlet fogging).

The case of direct water injection into the combustion system will be considered where the increase in power output is a result of the increased mass flow rate through the turbine, relative to that through the compressor. The limit on the increase in power is normally governed by the increase in

# Figure 19.12

shows the increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection where the water–fuel ratio is unity. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

# 19.3 Power augmentation using water injection

The power output of a single-shaft gas turbine may also be augmented by the use of water injection. The water may be injected either at the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. As discussed earlier, power augmentation by injecting water into the compressor inlet occurs due to the suppression of the compressor inlet temperature, and the amount of compressor inlet temperature suppression depends on the humidity of the air at the inlet of the compressor (wetted media and inlet fogging).

The case of direct water injection into the combustion system will be considered where the increase in power output is a result of the increased mass flow rate through the turbine, relative to that through the compressor. The limit on the increase in power is normally governed by the increase in

CO and UHC emissions due to the chilling of the flame in the primary zone. There is also an adverse effect on the turbine blade creep life usage, which must be taken into consideration.

# Figure 19.12

shows the increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection where the water–fuel ratio is unity. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

# Figure 19.12

shows the increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection where the water–fuel ratio is unity. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

# 19.3 Power augmentation using water injection

The power output of a single-shaft gas turbine may also be augmented by the use of water injection. The water may be injected either at the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. As discussed earlier, power augmentation by injecting water into the compressor inlet occurs due to the suppression of the compressor inlet temperature, and the amount of compressor inlet temperature suppression depends on the humidity of the air at the inlet of the compressor (wetted media and inlet fogging).

The case of direct water injection into the combustion system will be considered where the increase in power output is a result of the increased mass flow rate through the turbine, relative to that through the compressor. The limit on the increase in power is normally governed by the increase in

# Figure 19.12

shows the increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection where the water–fuel ratio is unity. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

The power output of a single-shaft gas turbine may also be augmented by the use of water injection.

# 19.3 Power augmentation using water injection

The power output of a single-shaft gas turbine may also be augmented by the use of water injection. The water may be injected either at the inlet of the compressor or directly into the primary zone of the combustion system. As discussed earlier, power augmentation by injecting water into the compressor inlet occurs due to the suppression of the compressor inlet temperature, and the amount of compressor inlet temperature suppression depends on the humidity of the air at the inlet of the compressor (wetted media and inlet fogging).

The case of direct water injection into the combustion system will be considered where the increase in power output is a result of the increased mass flow rate through the turbine, relative to that through the compressor. The limit on the increase in power is normally governed by the increase in

# Figure 19.12

shows the increase in gas turbine power output due to water injection where the water–fuel ratio is unity. At an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, there is about a 5% increase in gas turbine power output. This compares with about a 7% increase in power output for the two-shaft gas turbine. Unlike the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, the single-shaft gas turbine speed is constant and therefore the compressor flow essentially remains constant. In the case of the two-shaft gas turbine, there is an increase in the gas generator speed due to the increase in the power output from the gas generator turbine. This results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, contributing to the increased power output from the engine due to water injection. In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.

In the single-shaft gas turbine, the increase in power output due to water injection is due primarily to the increase in turbine power. With the decrease in ambient temperature, the gas turbine becomes power limited and, with water injection, the power limit is reached at a higher ambient temperature, as seen in Fig. 19.12.

As with the two-shaft gas turbine, there is a significant loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency due to water injection, as shown in Fig. 19.13. Additional fuel is needed to evaporate the water in the combustion chamber (latent heat) and heat the steam to the turbine entry temperature.

Injecting the water directly into the combustor results in an increase in compressor pressure ratio (Fig. 19.17) and in the turbine power output.
