Much of this work would have been impossible without the support, help and suggestions from friends and colleagues. In particular, I wish to thank Dr John Greenbank and John Layton for their expert proofreading, which has improved the quality of the text and presentation of the book. Also, my friend and mentor Professor Robin Elder, who is wholly responsible for first introducing me to serious engineering computing, for his encouragement and support throughout the writing and preparation of this book. Also, I thank Woodhead Publishing for its patience during the preparation of the manuscript, particularly Sheril Leich for her thorough checking of the manuscript and suggestions.

I also wish to remember J. R. (Jimmy) Palmer of Cranfield Institute of Technology (now Cranfield University) who, in his day, was considered one of the authorities on gas turbine performance. I am privileged to have known him.

# Note about the CD-ROM accompanying this book

As stated in the Preface, this CD-ROM includes software simulating the operation of a single-shaft gas turbine and a two-shaft gas turbine. The simulators are built on the engine modelling concepts discussed in the book and should be used to repeat the simulation discussion in Parts II and III and to perform the exercises in Chapter 21.

Much of this work would have been impossible without the support, help and suggestions from friends and colleagues. In particular, I wish to thank Dr John Greenbank and John Layton for their expert proofreading, which has improved the quality of the text and presentation of the book. Also, my friend and mentor Professor Robin Elder, who is wholly responsible for first introducing me to serious engineering computing, for his encouragement and support throughout the writing and preparation of this book. Also, I thank Woodhead Publishing for its patience during the preparation of the manuscript, particularly Sheril Leich for her thorough checking of the manuscript and suggestions.

I also wish to remember J. R. (Jimmy) Palmer of Cranfield Institute of Technology (now Cranfield University) who, in his day, was considered one of the authorities on gas turbine performance. I am privileged to have known him.

# Note about the CD-ROM accompanying this book

As stated in the Preface, this CD-ROM includes software simulating the operation of a single-shaft gas turbine and a two-shaft gas turbine. The simulators are built on the engine modelling concepts discussed in the book and should be used to repeat the simulation discussion in Parts II and III and to perform the exercises in Chapter 21.

Much of this work would have been impossible without the support, help and suggestions from friends and colleagues. In particular, I wish to thank Dr John Greenbank and John Layton for their expert proofreading, which has improved the quality of the text and presentation of the book. Also, my friend and mentor Professor Robin Elder, who is wholly responsible for first introducing me to serious engineering computing, for his encouragement and support throughout the writing and preparation of this book. Also, I thank Woodhead Publishing for its patience during the preparation of the manuscript, particularly Sheril Leich for her thorough checking of the manuscript and suggestions.

I also wish to remember J. R. (Jimmy) Palmer of Cranfield Institute of Technology (now Cranfield University) who, in his day, was considered one of the authorities on gas turbine performance. I am privileged to have known him.

# Note about the CD-ROM accompanying this book

As stated in the Preface, this CD-ROM includes software simulating the operation of a single-shaft gas turbine and a two-shaft gas turbine. The simulators are built on the engine modelling concepts discussed in the book and should be used to repeat the simulation discussion in Parts II and III and to perform the exercises in Chapter 21.

Much of this work would have been impossible without the support, help and suggestions from friends and colleagues. In particular, I wish to thank Dr John Greenbank and John Layton for their expert proofreading, which has improved the quality of the text and presentation of the book. Also, my friend and mentor Professor Robin Elder, who is wholly responsible for first introducing me to serious engineering computing, for his encouragement and support throughout the writing and preparation of this book. Also, I thank Woodhead Publishing for its patience during the preparation of the manuscript, particularly Sheril Leich for her thorough checking of the manuscript and suggestions.

I also wish to remember J. R. (Jimmy) Palmer of Cranfield Institute of Technology (now Cranfield University) who, in his day, was considered one of the authorities on gas turbine performance. I am privileged to have known him.

# Note about the CD-ROM accompanying this book

As stated in the Preface, this CD-ROM includes software simulating the operation of a single-shaft gas turbine and a two-shaft gas turbine. The simulators are built on the engine modelling concepts discussed in the book and should be used to repeat the simulation discussion in Parts II and III and to perform the exercises in Chapter 21.
