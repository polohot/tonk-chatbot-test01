transient performance of turbines. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.10 in Chapter 5. Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

Since the thermodynamic process in turbines is assumed to be adiabatic, the energy term, Eₙₑₜ can be determined from the turbine pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency as:

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

Applying Newton’s second law of motion:

where α and I are the angular acceleration or deceleration of the rotor system and polar moment of inertia of the rotor, respectively.

Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

Since the thermodynamic process in turbines is assumed to be adiabatic, the energy term, Eₙₑₜ can be determined from the turbine pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency as:

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

transient performance of turbines. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.10 in Chapter 5. Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

Since the pressure at the exit of the exhaust system is the ambient pressure, the pressure loss in the exhaust system is readily known. From Equation 7.6, the mass flow rate can be calculated.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

Applying Newton’s second law of motion:

transient performance of turbines. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.10 in Chapter 5. Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

Since the thermodynamic process in turbines is assumed to be adiabatic, the energy term, Eₙₑₜ can be determined from the turbine pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency as:

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

Since the pressure at the exit of the exhaust system is the ambient pressure, the pressure loss in the exhaust system is readily known. From Equation 7.6, the mass flow rate can be calculated.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

transient performance of turbines. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.10 in Chapter 5. Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

Since the thermodynamic process in turbines is assumed to be adiabatic, the energy term, Eₙₑₜ can be determined from the turbine pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency as:

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

loss equation for the exhaust system is similar to Equation 7.6 in Chapter 7, but the temperature rise is zero. Since the pressure at the exit of the exhaust system is the ambient pressure, the pressure loss in the exhaust system is readily known. From Equation 7.6, the mass flow rate can be calculated.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

Applying Newton’s second law of motion:

where α and I are the angular acceleration or deceleration of the rotor system and polar moment of inertia of the rotor, respectively.

Given an initial angular velocity, the current angular velocity can be calculated from the angular acceleration calculated from Equation 10.33. The analysis can be extended to other engine configurations discussed in Chapter 1.

transient performance of turbines. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.10 in Chapter 5. Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

Since the thermodynamic process in turbines is assumed to be adiabatic, the energy term, Eₙₑₜ can be determined from the turbine pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency as:

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

Since the pressure at the exit of the exhaust system is the ambient pressure, the pressure loss in the exhaust system is readily known. From Equation 7.6, the mass flow rate can be calculated.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.

Applying Newton’s second law of motion:

where α and I are the angular acceleration or deceleration of the rotor system and polar moment of inertia of the rotor, respectively.

transient performance of turbines. Typical turbine characteristics are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.10 in Chapter 5. Knowing the current values for inlet flow, pressure, temperature and turbine speed, these characteristics can be used to determine the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency. The pressure ratio can then be translated to the Fₙₑₜ term using Equation 10.29. However, this is only applicable to the unchoked part of the turbine characteristic. When turbines operate in the choked part of the characteristic, the momentum Equation 10.26 is not applicable, and only the continuity and energy equations need to be considered (Equations 10.25 and 10.27, respectively).

Since the thermodynamic process in turbines is assumed to be adiabatic, the energy term, Eₙₑₜ can be determined from the turbine pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency as:

# 10.6.7 Boundary conditions

Equations 10.25, 10.26 and 10.27 calculated the mass flow rate at the inlet of an element and pressure and temperature at the exit of an element. Therefore, a means of defining the inlet pressure and temperature into the first element in a simulation system and the mass flow rate at the exit from the last element of the system from boundary conditions is needed. In industrial gas turbines, the inlet pressure at the entry to the system, which is usually the filtration system, is the ambient pressure and therefore can be used as the inlet boundary condition. This is shown in Fig. 10.18, which is an elemental representation of a single shaft gas turbine. The inlet temperature at the entry to the system will also correspond to the ambient temperature.

The last element of an industrial gas turbine would normally be the exhaust system as shown in Fig. 10.18. This element incurs a small pressure loss, typically in the order of about 100 mm water gauge and can be used to determine the flow at the exit from the last dynamic element – the turbine as shown in Fig. 10.18. Since the pressure and temperature at the exit from the turbine element (which is the inlet to the exhaust system) are known, calculation of the mass flow rate at the exit from the turbine element is possible using the equation describing the pressure loss in the exhaust system.

# 10.6.8 Compressor–turbine speed calculation

During transients, the compressor–turbine and the driven load may vary in speed depending on the power absorbed by the compressor and load, and the power developed by the turbine. Also, the gas turbine configuration and control system performance will influence the changes in speed of these components. The power absorbed by the compressor and the power developed by the turbine are readily calculated as discussed previously. For a given compressor and turbine speed, the torque at the compressor and turbine are readily calculated using the relationship:

power = torque × angular velocity

Therefore, at any instance the torque at the compressor and turbine can be calculated. Furthermore, for a given power output and load speed, the torque at the load is also known. For a single-shaft gas turbine rotor, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the net torque, Tnet, is given by:

Tnet = Tturb – (Tcomp + Tload),

where Tturb, Tcomp and Tload are the torque at the turbine, compressor and load, respectively.
