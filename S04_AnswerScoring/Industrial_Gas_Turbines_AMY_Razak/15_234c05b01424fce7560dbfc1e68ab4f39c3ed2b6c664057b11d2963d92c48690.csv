NOₓ has been associated with the formation of acid rain and smog, and it has also been associated with the depletion of the ozone layer. CO is a poisonous gas whereas UHC is not only toxic but UHCs also combine with NOₓ to produce smog. Combustion systems that use hydrocarbon fuels produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapour (H₂O) due to the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen. Although CO₂ and H₂O are considered non-toxic, they are greenhouse gases and have been associated with global warming.

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Although DLE combustion systems have reduced emissions of NOx, CO and UHC appreciably, for a given fuel, the reduction of CO2 and H2O can only be achieved by improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbines without resorting to carbon capture and storage. To achieve this improvement, combined cycle and co-generation systems, where the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilised to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant, are now in operation. These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air. The above methods of carbon capture and storage are discussed in Andersen et al.3 and in Griffiths et al.4

The use of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells, in combination with gas turbines, can also be used to capture CO2 by keeping the CO2 stream and the water vapour streams separate. This is achieved by avoiding mixing the cathode and anode exit streams as the anode stream in principle is a mixture of CO2, water vapour and some unused fuel.

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Although DLE combustion systems have reduced emissions of NOx, CO and UHC appreciably, for a given fuel, the reduction of CO2 and H2O can only be achieved by improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbines without resorting to carbon capture and storage. To achieve this improvement, combined cycle and co-generation systems, where the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilised to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant, are now in operation. These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air.

The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air.

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage.

This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air. The above methods of carbon capture and storage are discussed in Andersen et al.3 and in Griffiths et al.4

The use of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells, in combination with gas turbines, can also be used to capture CO2 by keeping the CO2 stream and the water vapour streams separate.

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Although DLE combustion systems have reduced emissions of NOx, CO and UHC appreciably, for a given fuel, the reduction of CO2 and H2O can only be achieved by improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbines without resorting to carbon capture and storage. To achieve this improvement, combined cycle and co-generation systems, where the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilised to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant, are now in operation. These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air. The above methods of carbon capture and storage are discussed in Andersen et al.3 and in Griffiths et al.4

The use of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells, in combination with gas turbines, can also be used to capture CO2 by keeping the CO2 stream and the water vapour streams separate. This is achieved by avoiding mixing the cathode and anode exit streams as the anode stream in principle is a mixture of CO2, water vapour and some unused fuel.

Combustion systems that use hydrocarbon fuels produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapour (H₂O) due to the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen. Although CO₂ and H₂O are considered non-toxic, they are greenhouse gases and have been associated with global warming.

The need to reduce emissions is now of paramount importance in protecting health and the environment. The last decade has seen a rapid change in regulations for controlling gas turbine emissions. Such regulations have resulted in the development of dry low emission (DLE) combustion systems and, today, many gas turbines operate using such combustors.

Although DLE combustion systems have reduced emissions of NOx, CO and UHC appreciably, for a given fuel, the reduction of CO2 and H2O can only be achieved by improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbines without resorting to carbon capture and storage. To achieve this improvement, combined cycle and co-generation systems, where the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is utilised to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant, are now in operation. These systems can achieve overall thermal efficiencies of about 60% and 80%, respectively. Other technologies, where fuel cells are used in conjunction with gas turbines, are capable of producing power at thermal efficiencies approaching 70%. The use of low carbon content fuel or carbon-free fuels, such as hydrogen, will also help reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions.

Other systems considered include CO2 capture using solvents such as methanol amine (MEA) and storage, therefore preventing these gases from entering the atmosphere. This is often referred to as post-combustion carbon capture and storage and is being actively considered for current gas turbine power plants. Another method involves the removal and capture of CO2 before combustion and is therefore referred to as pre-combustion carbon capture and storage. Here, the fuel, normally natural gas, is converted to CO and H2. Steam (H2O) is added in the presence of a catalyst where the steam is reduced to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The CO is now oxidised to CO2, which is then captured and stored. The reduction of H2O and oxidation of CO is often referred to as the water gas shift reaction and was discovered by the Italian physicist, Felice Fontana, in 1780. The hydrogen (from the fuel and steam) is burnt in the gas turbine to produce power. A third method of carbon capture and storage, known as oxyfuel, involves the burning of fuel in oxygen. Thus the only gaseous emission is CO2, which is captured and stored. The oxygen required for combustion is captured or separated from the air. The above methods of carbon capture and storage are discussed in Andersen et al.3 and in Griffiths et al.4

The use of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells, in combination with gas turbines, can also be used to capture CO2 by keeping the CO2 stream and the water vapour streams separate. This is achieved by avoiding mixing the cathode and anode exit streams as the anode stream in principle is a mixture of CO2, water vapour and some unused fuel.
