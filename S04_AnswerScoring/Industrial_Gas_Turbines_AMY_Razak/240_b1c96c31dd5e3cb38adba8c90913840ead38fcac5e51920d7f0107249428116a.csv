After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Figure 15.23 displays the trends in power when reset wind-up is active and the power output from the gas generator is observed responding to the change in set point to 12 MW. The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2.

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

15.25 Trend in power when the engine trips due to high exhaust gas temperature (EGT).

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

15.25 Trend in power when the engine trips due to high exhaust gas temperature (EGT).

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2.

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

Referring to Fig. 15.11, at high ambient temperatures, the exhaust gas

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

15.25 Trend in power when the engine trips due to high exhaust gas temperature (EGT).

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

The trend in flows and fuel valve position are shown in Fig. 15.24. Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

15.6 Trends in speed due to high integral gain.

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.

After about 100 seconds, the integral action is switched on and the power output from the gas turbine is observed approaching the set point of 19 MW. The integral gain is set to 0.1 and a long time period results (about 100 seconds) before the required set point is reached and this delay is due to the small value of the integral gain.

Increasing the integral gain to 2 results in a very rapid increase in power output, as observed in Fig. 15.3. The oscillatory response is clearly seen and the control system reaches the set point of 19 MW in about 15 seconds, thus representing a significant improvement in transient response of the engine compared with the previous case, which represented a small integral gain of 0.1. (It is necessary to inactivate the engine trips during this type of simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions to inactive engine trips.)

Reducing the integral gain to about 0.4 still maintains a rapid response in power output but virtually eliminates the overshoots, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Such optimisation is necessary in tuning control systems and the optimisation process is a specialist area, which is outside the scope of this book but is discussed in Shaw1 and in Sivanandam2.

It has been stated above that an oscillatory response due to poor control system performance has a detrimental effect on turbine creep life. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.5, which shows the trend in turbine creep life usage when the integral gain is set to 2. The creep life usage is observed for both gas generator and power turbines where the creep lives undershoot the steady-

The gas generator turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state creep life by about 30,000 hours and the power turbine creep life undershoots the steady-state value by about 150,000 hours. The decrease in creep life occurs due to the fuel flow overcompensating because of the poor performance of the control system. This results in

Overshoots in the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature, as shown in Figs 15.6 and 15.7, respectively. The increase in speed and turbine entry temperature during the overshoot is always greater than the decreases in speed and turbine entry temperature during the corresponding undershoot as the control system endeavours to attain steady state conditions. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of the Larson–Miller curve (see Fig. 5.11), which describes the average creep life of the turbine blades, results in a greater decrease in

the Larson–Miller parameter during the overshoot than the increase in this parameter during the undershoot in speed and temperature. Thus both these effects result in a decrease in creep life.

Although the significant loss in creep life occurs for only a very short period of time, the decrease in creep life of the turbines will accumulate if such oscillatory response is allowed to continue, leading to a reduced engine life and increased engine overhauls and therefore increasing maintenance costs.

The trend for speeds and temperatures for the optimised case, where the integral gain was set to 0.4, is shown in Figs 15.8 and 15.9, respectively. Virtually no oscillatory response is observed. Consequently, a satisfactory trend in turbine creep life is obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.10.

# 15.3 Signal selection

In Section 10.2 the use of signal selection to prevent any operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speeds being exceeded was described. This action protects the engine from damage and achieves suitable turbine creep life. In fact, signal selection was used when the effect of ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Section 11.3, where the power output of the gas turbine becoming limited by either the exhaust gas temperature, gas generator speed or compressor non-dimensional speed limits was demonstrated. Hence these figures are reproduced here for a discussion of signal selection.

temperature limits the power output, as the gas generator speed and compressor non-dimensional speed are below their limiting condition. This is observed in Fig. 15.12, which shows the trends in speeds during the ambient temperature transient (+ 30 to –30 degrees over one hour).

As the ambient temperature decreases, the gas generator speed and the compressor non-dimensional speed increase until the ambient temperature reduces to about 12 degrees Celsius, at which point the gas generator speed limit is reached. At ambient temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius, the

Signal selection switches from exhaust gas temperature control to gas generator speed control, when the gas generator speed will remain constant at its 100% speed, or a continuous rating value until the ambient temperature reduces to about –11 degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.12).

Note that the exhaust gas temperature decreases (Fig. 15.11) during constant gas generator speed operation and the compressor non-dimensional speed continues to increase. At ambient temperatures below –11 degrees Celsius,

15.12 Trends in speed during ambient temperature transient. The compressor non-dimensional speed limit is reached and the signal selection now switches to compressor non-dimensional speed control. At an ambient temperature below –11 degrees Celsius, both the exhaust gas temperature and gas generator speed are observed to continue to decrease. Thus, this is how signal selection protects the engine from over-speeding or overheating.

# 15.4 Acceleration and deceleration lines

Signal selection discussed above considered only limits on the exhaust gas temperature and speed. Although these would be the limiting values during steady-state and slow transient conditions, a means is needed of preventing conditions that would occur during fast transients, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, resulting in flameout or compressor surge. It is the variation of the air–fuel ratio that is important, as flameout occurs when the air–fuel ratio is outside the combustion stability limits. The computation of the air–fuel ratio is not practical, as the combustion airflow value is needed and is often unavailable.

Figure 15.13 shows the variation of fuel flow with gas generator speed for a series of ambient temperatures, T₁ varying from –30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. The figure also shows the acceleration and deceleration limits. Figure 15.14 shows the variation of air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature, T₁, and gas generator speed. Note that the variation of the air–fuel ratio with ambient temperature is small for a limited range of gas generator speed (from about 8000 RPM to 10 000 RPM). Referring to Fig. 15.13, at

low ambient temperatures, the margin for acceleration will decrease and the margin for deceleration will increase. Thus the transient response during acceleration will be poor and the increased deceleration margin could result in flameout during deceleration. Conversely, at high ambient temperatures

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The acceleration margin will increase, whereas the deceleration margin will decrease. Thus at high ambient temperatures, the increased acceleration margin could result in flameout due to low air–fuel ratios. Low air–fuel ratios can also result in high turbine temperatures and compressor surge. The reduced deceleration margin at high ambient temperatures will result in poor transient response of the gas turbine during deceleration. These problems may be overcome by implementing the acceleration–deceleration (‘accel–decel’) schedules, also known as the fuel schedule curves, using non-dimensional parameters as discussed in Section 10.3. Because of the non-dimensional behaviour of gas turbines resulting in unique running lines, as shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.7 in Section 11.2, the accel–decel schedules are applicable for all ambient temperatures and pressure. The non-dimensional parameters considered in Section 10.3 were the compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional speed. However, the variation of these non-dimensional parameters exhibit a kink and this is due to the VIGV/VSV movement as discussed in Section 11.2 and shown in Fig. 15.15, which also displays the accel and decel lines.

The implementation of the accel and decel lines would be simpler if the kink is eliminated and this can be achieved by using the non-dimensional parameters for fuel flow and compressor pressure ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.16. The figure also shows the accel and decel lines. Thus, in the simulator the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow is used with compressor pressure ratio to implement the accel–decel lines. In practice, manufacturers may omit the temperature term present in the non-dimensional fuel flow as it is a weaker function compared with the pressure term.

15.17 Transient operating points on acceleration–deceleration lines. The transient operating points due to a step increase in power demand from 1 MW to 19 MW on the acceleration–deceleration curve are shown in Fig. 15.17. The figure also shows the transient operating points due to a step decrease in power demand from 19 MW to 1 MW. All the transient operating points during both acceleration and deceleration are observed to remain.

within the acceleration–deceleration limit lines, thus ensuring satisfactory transient operation of the engine. Fig. 15.18 shows the transient operating points on the compressor characteristic during acceleration and deceleration. Note that all the transient operating points do not cross the compressor surge line during acceleration, thus preventing compressor surge during acceleration.

In the absence of acceleration and deceleration lines, the operating points during engine transient may cross these limiting lines, resulting in compressor surge or flameout conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.19, which shows the operating points for the same transient described above on the acceleration–deceleration curve when the acceleration and deceleration lines are inactive. It is observed that the operating points cross the acceleration and deceleration lines during the transient, particularly during deceleration, and could result in flameout due to the air–fuel ratio exceeding the weak flammability limit. The operating points crossing the acceleration line would result in compressor surge, as shown in Fig. 15.20, which displays the operating points on the compressor characteristic during these transients.

# 15.5 Integral wind-up

The size of the fuel valve is of paramount importance in ensuring satisfactory fuel flow to the engine and thus achieving the required power output subject to engine operating limits such as exhaust gas temperature and speed limits as discussed previously, particularly during transient operation. Inadequate fuel valve capacity will result in unexpected behaviour of the control system.

and one such behaviour is due to the continuous increase in the integral output, often referred to as integral wind-up, due to the fuel valve becoming fully opened, as discussed in Section 10.1.2. It should also be noted that, if the fuel pressure is low due to a fault in the fuel system, the fuel valve could become fully opened. Integral wind-up will now be illustrated using the gas

# Simulation of engine control system performance

The turbine simulator. (It is necessary to ensure that the integral reset wind-up is switched off for this simulation exercise – see the user guide on the CD for instructions on switching off the reset wind-up.)

The valve flow coefficient (CG) is reduced to half its design value from 1100 to 550. If the power demand from the electric generator is increased from 1 MW to 20 MW, the fuel valve will open fully (100%). However, the power output will not meet the generator power demand due to insufficient fuel flow. The power output from the generator would be about 14.8 MW, which is well short of the required power demand of 20 MW. The important point to note is that no engine operating limits such as the exhaust gas temperature or speed limit have been reached. Under these conditions the integral output would be observed to continue to increase and exceed 100% output as the control system attempts to open the fuel valve to meet the generator power demand. Since the fuel valve is fully opened, no further increase in fuel flow can occur and thus no increase in power output from the gas turbine is possible. As long as these conditions prevail, the integral output continues to increase or wind up and should be observed in the main display screen of the gas turbine simulator.

If we reduce the generator set point from 20 MW to, say, 12 MW, which is below the current power output from the generator, it is observed that the generator power output will remain at 14.8 MW. This unexpected result occurs because the integral output is above 100% but will then be observed to start winding down and this can be seen on the main screen of the simulator. The power output from the generator will remain at 14.8 MW until the integral output has completely wound down (below 100%), after which the power output from the electrical generator will decrease and eventually match the set point value of 12 MW.

The above is summarised in Figs 15.21 and 15.22, which show the trends in power and fuel flow/valve position, respectively. Figure 15.21 shows the generator power output remaining at 14.8 MW until the integral output has wound down, although the generator set point has decreased from 20 MW to 12 MW after about 100 seconds. Figure 15.22 shows the trend in the fuel valve position, which remains at 100% until the integral output has wound down. The fuel valve then closes so that the power output from the generator matches the required power as stipulated by the generator set point.

To prevent the integral output from winding up, so resulting in this unexpected response from the engine control system, the output from the PID controller is reset to 100% if the output from the control system exceeds 100% and the fuel valve is concurrently fully open. This is achieved with the simulator by clicking the reset wind-up option to ‘Reset Wind-up On’ with the engine control setting display (see user guide). The above simulation is run again and the generator power output set point reduced to 12 MW as above. However, on this occasion the power output from the generator responds.

Again, the fuel valve is observed responding to the change in power demand from the generator almost immediately when the reset wind-up option is active.

# Engine trips

In Section 15.2, the likelihood of trips due to poor control system performance was discussed, where excursions in exhaust gas temperature and speeds can occur, thereby exceeding their trip levels. A well-tuned control system would prevent such excursions and hence engine trips. However, in certain situations

# 426 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The control system may not be able to respond adequately and will result in trips. Although trip levels are important to protect the engine from damage, their frequent occurrence is indicative of faults either in the control system or in the operating procedure, resulting in increased unscheduled downtime and reduced availability. Some engine faults, such as compressor VIGV/VSV schedule problems, may also result in trips. These problems affect revenue and profits and thereby increase life cycle costs.

One such trip is illustrated, where water injection to augment the power output of the gas turbine is considered. The injection of water results in a decrease in thermal efficiency and thus, for a given power output, requires an increase in fuel flow. If water injection is ceased then care must be taken not to reduce the water injection rate rapidly as the fuel flow rate may not decrease sufficiently, thus injecting too much fuel resulting in a very high gas temperature (due to the absence of water). Such increases in gas temperature may result in engine trips.

The simulator is run at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius where water injection for power augmentation is most beneficial and the generator power demand (power set point) is set to 25 MW. After 10 seconds of operation, water is injected over a period of 10 seconds (ramp time) to achieve a water–fuel ratio of 1.5. Figure 15.25 shows the trends in power and the generator power is observed to be increasing when water injection is present. After about 50 seconds water injection is ceased by reducing the ramp time to just 1 second, so reducing the water injection very rapidly. The engine is observed to trip very shortly after 50 seconds.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

This is illustrated more clearly in Fig. 15.26, which show the corresponding trends in exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The exhaust gas temperature is observed to rise and it reaches its trip level, resulting in the engine trip. Figure 15.27 shows the trends in speed and it is noted that an increase in gas generator speed occurs but that this increase in speed is insufficient to initiate a trip. (Note: In the simulator, a trip is simulated by reducing the power output of the gas turbine to its idle power output, which is set to 1 MW.)

Trends in temperature with and without water injection. Ramp time is increased sufficiently when water injection cessation is desired, thus preventing the exhaust gas temperature from rising rapidly. To use a short ramp time, it would be necessary to reduce the power demand before shutting off the water injection. The case is illustrated where the ramp time is increased when shutting off the water injection. The ramp time is increased from 1 second to 10 seconds in this case.

Figure 15.28 shows the trend in exhaust gas temperature when the ramp time is increased to 10 seconds, and it can be seen that the exhaust gas temperature rises, but not sufficiently to cause a trip condition. Thus, increasing the ramp time representing the time period for switching off the water reduces the increase in exhaust gas temperature. In the simulation, the user should also note the change in primary zone temperature due to water injection. It is left to the user to vary the ramp time to investigate its influence on the change in exhaust gas temperature due to shutting off the water injection.
