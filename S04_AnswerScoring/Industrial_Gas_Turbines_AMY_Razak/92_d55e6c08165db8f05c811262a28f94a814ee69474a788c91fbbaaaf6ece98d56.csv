Figures 6.15(a) and (b) show a simplex pressure swirl atomiser. The fuel enters the vortex chamber tangentially (Fig. 6.15(b)) and leaves through the orifice producing a conical sheet of fuel as shown in Fig. 6.15(a). The major problem with a simplex atomiser is obtaining good atomisation over a wide fuel flow range. Typically, a gas turbine will require a fuel turndown of about 40:1 to cover its operating power range (i.e. idle power fuel flow requirements will be about 1/40th of the full power fuel flow requirements).

When the orifice is optimised (made small enough) to give good atomisation at low fuel flow rates, then the required pressures for high fuel flows becomes excessive. The problem may be resolved by providing a dual-orifice atomiser as shown in Fig. 6.16. The orifice for the pilot fuel is of a smaller size and operates during low power settings. At higher power settings, the main fuel flow is also active and passes fuel through its own swirl chamber and orifice.

# 6.5.2 Air blast atomiser

The atomisation process in an air blast atomiser is achieved by allowing high-speed air to flow over a surface where the air mingles with the fuel at the lip or at the end of this surface. Good atomisation is achieved with lower fuel pressures compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

Air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions. These problems are overcome by combining the air blast atomiser with a pressure swirl atomiser. This design is more complex because the fuel flow for the idle and low power operating conditions is supplied by the pressure swirl atomiser, whereas at higher power settings, the fuel supply is provided by the air blast atomiser.

# 6.5.3

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

There is only a narrow range of fuel–air ratios or equivalence ratios when combustion is possible. Figure 6.19 shows a typical combustion stability loop, where the equivalence ratio is plotted against the combustion airflow rate.

Air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions. These problems are overcome by combining the air blast atomiser with a pressure swirl atomiser. This design is more complex because the fuel flow for the idle and low power operating conditions is supplied by the pressure swirl atomiser, whereas at higher power settings, the fuel supply is provided by the air blast atomiser.

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

# 6.6 Combustion stability and heat release rate

There is only a narrow range of fuel–air ratios or equivalence ratios when combustion is possible. Figure 6.19 shows a typical combustion stability loop, where the equivalence ratio is plotted against the combustion airflow rate.

For a given combustion airflow rate, there is a lean and rich equivalence ratio range within which combustion is possible. Increasing the flow rate reduces the range of equivalence ratio when combustion is possible due to the increase in velocity, reaching a unique flow rate when these two stability ranges meet and this corresponds to an equivalence ratio of about 1.0 (stoichiometric fuel–air ratio).

Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor.

Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

For a given combustion airflow rate, there is a lean and rich equivalence ratio range within which combustion is possible. Increasing the flow rate reduces the range of equivalence ratio when combustion is possible due to the increase in velocity, reaching a unique flow rate when these two stability ranges meet and this corresponds to an equivalence ratio of about 1.0 (stoichiometric fuel–air ratio).

The major problem with a simplex atomiser is obtaining good atomisation over a wide fuel flow range. Typically, a gas turbine will require a fuel turndown of about 40:1 to cover its operating power range (i.e. idle power fuel flow requirements will be about 1/40th of the full power fuel flow requirements).

When the orifice is optimised (made small enough) to give good atomisation at low fuel flow rates, then the required pressures for high fuel flows becomes excessive.

The atomisation process in an air blast atomiser is achieved by allowing high-speed air to flow over a surface where the air mingles with the fuel at the lip or at the end of this surface.

Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor.

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour.

The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion.

The major problem with a simplex atomiser is obtaining good atomisation over a wide fuel flow range. Typically, a gas turbine will require a fuel turndown of about 40:1 to cover its operating power range (i.e. idle power fuel flow requirements will be about 1/40th of the full power fuel flow requirements).

# 6.5.2 Air blast atomiser

The atomisation process in an air blast atomiser is achieved by allowing high-speed air to flow over a surface where the air mingles with the fuel at the lip or at the end of this surface. Good atomisation is achieved with lower fuel pressures compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions. These problems are overcome by combining the air blast atomiser with a pressure swirl atomiser. This design is more complex because the fuel flow for the idle and low power operating conditions is supplied by the pressure swirl atomiser, whereas at higher power settings, the fuel supply is provided by the air blast atomiser.

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions. These problems are overcome by combining the air blast atomiser with a pressure swirl atomiser. This design is more complex because the fuel flow for the idle and low power operating conditions is supplied by the pressure swirl atomiser, whereas at higher power settings, the fuel supply is provided by the air blast atomiser.

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

# 6.6 Combustion stability and heat release rate

There is only a narrow range of fuel–air ratios or equivalence ratios when combustion is possible. Figure 6.19 shows a typical combustion stability loop, where the equivalence ratio is plotted against the combustion airflow rate.

For a given combustion airflow rate, there is a lean and rich equivalence ratio range within which combustion is possible. Increasing the flow rate reduces the range of equivalence ratio when combustion is possible due to the increase in velocity, reaching a unique flow rate when these two stability ranges meet and this corresponds to an equivalence ratio of about 1.0 (stoichiometric fuel–air ratio).

The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

# 6.6 Combustion stability and heat release rate

There is only a narrow range of fuel–air ratios or equivalence ratios when combustion is possible. Figure 6.19 shows a typical combustion stability loop, where the equivalence ratio is plotted against the combustion airflow rate.

6.19 Typical combustion stability curve.

For a given combustion airflow rate, there is a lean and rich equivalence ratio range within which combustion is possible. Increasing the flow rate reduces the range of equivalence ratio when combustion is possible due to the increase in velocity, reaching a unique flow rate when these two stability ranges meet and this corresponds to an equivalence ratio of about 1.0 (stoichiometric fuel–air ratio).

Figures 6.15(a) and (b) show a simplex pressure swirl atomiser. The fuel enters the vortex chamber tangentially (Fig. 6.15(b)) and leaves through the orifice producing a conical sheet of fuel as shown in Fig. 6.15(a). The major problem with a simplex atomiser is obtaining good atomisation over a wide fuel flow range. Typically, a gas turbine will require a fuel turndown of about 40:1 to cover its operating power range (i.e. idle power fuel flow requirements will be about 1/40th of the full power fuel flow requirements).

When the orifice is optimised (made small enough) to give good atomisation at low fuel flow rates, then the required pressures for high fuel flows becomes excessive. The problem may be resolved by providing a dual-orifice atomiser as shown in Fig. 6.16. The orifice for the pilot fuel is of a smaller size and operates during low power settings. At higher power settings, the main fuel flow is also active and passes fuel through its own swirl chamber and orifice.

# 6.5.2 Air blast atomiser

The atomisation process in an air blast atomiser is achieved by allowing high-speed air to flow over a surface where the air mingles with the fuel at the lip or at the end of this surface. Good atomisation is achieved with lower fuel pressures compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour.

The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.2 Air blast atomiser

The atomisation process in an air blast atomiser is achieved by allowing high-speed air to flow over a surface where the air mingles with the fuel at the lip or at the end of this surface. Good atomisation is achieved with lower fuel pressures compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions.

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions. These problems are overcome by combining the air blast atomiser with a pressure swirl atomiser. This design is more complex because the fuel flow for the idle and low power operating conditions is supplied by the pressure swirl atomiser, whereas at higher power settings, the fuel supply is provided by the air blast atomiser.

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

# 6.6 Combustion stability and heat release rate

There is only a narrow range of fuel–air ratios or equivalence ratios when combustion is possible. Figure 6.19 shows a typical combustion stability loop, where the equivalence ratio is plotted against the combustion airflow rate.

For a given combustion airflow rate, there is a lean and rich equivalence ratio range within which combustion is possible. Increasing the flow rate reduces the range of equivalence ratio when combustion is possible due to the increase in velocity, reaching a unique flow rate when these two stability ranges meet and this corresponds to an equivalence ratio of about 1.0 (stoichiometric fuel–air ratio).

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor.

Figures 6.15(a) and (b) show a simplex pressure swirl atomiser. The fuel enters the vortex chamber tangentially (Fig. 6.15(b)) and leaves through the orifice producing a conical sheet of fuel as shown in Fig. 6.15(a). The major problem with a simplex atomiser is obtaining good atomisation over a wide fuel flow range. Typically, a gas turbine will require a fuel turndown of about 40:1 to cover its operating power range (i.e. idle power fuel flow requirements will be about 1/40th of the full power fuel flow requirements).

When the orifice is optimised (made small enough) to give good atomisation at low fuel flow rates, then the required pressures for high fuel flows becomes excessive. The problem may be resolved by providing a dual-orifice atomiser as shown in Fig. 6.16. The orifice for the pilot fuel is of a smaller size and operates during low power settings. At higher power settings, the main fuel flow is also active and passes fuel through its own swirl chamber and orifice.

# 6.5.2 Air blast atomiser

The atomisation process in an air blast atomiser is achieved by allowing high-speed air to flow over a surface where the air mingles with the fuel at the lip or at the end of this surface. Good atomisation is achieved with lower fuel pressures compared with the pressure swirl atomiser. Very little or no soot formation occurs, resulting in lower radiant heat, hence smaller flame tube cooling air requirements. The heat release rate is higher, resulting in a smaller combustor. Figure 6.17 shows a schematic of an air blast atomiser.

Air blast atomiser.

The disadvantages of this type of atomiser are a smaller stability limit and poor atomisation at lower airflow rates and start-up conditions. These problems are overcome by combining the air blast atomiser with a pressure swirl atomiser. This design is more complex because the fuel flow for the idle and low power operating conditions is supplied by the pressure swirl atomiser, whereas at higher power settings, the fuel supply is provided by the air blast atomiser.

# 6.5.3

# Fuel vaporisers

As an alternative to atomisation, liquid fuels can be heated above their boiling point so that all the liquid is converted into vapour. Such methods of preparing fuel for combustion are applicable only to high-grade fuels which leave no solid residue. The fuel enters the vaporising system, as shown in Fig. 6.18, and is heated in the vaporising tube using the heat in the primary zone. The vaporised fuel now enters the primary zone and mixes with the combustion air where it is burnt.

# 6.18 Fuel vaporising system

Advantages of using a vaporising system are low fuel pressure requirements and low soot formation. Disadvantages are the likelihood of thermal damage to the vaporiser tube and poor vaporisation during starting, when the vaporiser tube is cold. Also, during rapid acceleration, the fuel schedule has to be controlled to prevent the increase in fuel flow from overcooling the tube and resulting in poor vaporisation and combustion.

# 6.5.4 Gaseous fuels and injection

Unlike liquid fuels, gaseous fuels do not require atomisation and vaporisation. The fuel–air mixture needs only to be heated to high enough temperatures to produce radicals and species to initiate combustion. They therefore present few problems, provided that the fuel has a high calorific value such as natural gas. Lower calorific value fuels result in a considerable increase in fuel flow and can represent a significant portion of the combustor mass flow. Fuels with a low calorific value can result in lower burning or heat release rates requiring longer residence times and hence combustion volumes. Even with natural gas, the content of non-combustibles, particularly of CO2, has to be carefully monitored and controlled as a significant swing in calorific value can result due to a modest change in the CO2 content because of its high molecular weight. With gaseous fuels, fuel injection is normally achieved by the use of swirlers or nozzles.

# 6.6 Combustion stability and heat release rate

There is only a narrow range of fuel–air ratios or equivalence ratios when combustion is possible. Figure 6.19 shows a typical combustion stability loop, where the equivalence ratio is plotted against the combustion airflow rate.
