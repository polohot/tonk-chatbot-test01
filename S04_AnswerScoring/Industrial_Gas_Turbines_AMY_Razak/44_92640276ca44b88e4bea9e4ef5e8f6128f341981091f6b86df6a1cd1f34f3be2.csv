The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

W = c T ⌈ 1 – (1)(γγ–1) ⌉

turb p 3 ⌊ Pr ⌋

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# 5–6 Low pressure (LP) turbine

# (isentropic) expansion

# Figure 3.16 Two-stage reheat expansion process.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point.

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

These cycles correspond to (2–3–4–4′) in Fig. 3.11 and to (4′–4–5–6) in Fig. 3.17 for the intercooled and reheat cycles, respectively.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

Since only the optimised case for these added cycles has been considered, the LP compressor and HP turbine pressure ratios as shown (Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1) are equal for the respective cases. Furthermore, this condition results in the exhaust temperatures for these added cycles being equal to the compressor discharge temperatures (i.e. ",How does the thermal efficiency of an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle compare to that of an ideal simple cycle?,A5,The efficiency of an ideal reheat cycle is not as high as that of an ideal simple cycle.,0.32421875,0.453125,3.1875,1.0390625,0.12255859375

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

To compare the performance of the ideal intercooled and reheat cycle, it is necessary to consider the performance of the added simple gas turbine cycles to the base cycle when intercooling and reheat is applied. These cycles correspond to (2–3–4–4′) in Fig. 3.11 and to (4′–4–5–6) in Fig. 3.17 for the intercooled and reheat cycles, respectively.

Since only the optimised case for these added cycles has been considered, the LP compressor and HP turbine pressure ratios as shown (Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1) are equal for the respective cases. Furthermore, this condition results in the exhaust temperatures for these added cycles being equal to the compressor discharge temperatures (i.e. ",How does the turbine cooling air temperature affect the cooling air flow requirements in a gas turbine cycle?,A3,A decrease in turbine cooling air temperature leads to a reduction in the required cooling air flow.,1.8515625,2.0,3.46875,1.234375,0.2197265625

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

W = c T ⌈ 1 – (1)(γγ–1) ⌉

turb p 3 ⌊ Pr ⌋

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since only the optimised case for these added cycles has been considered, the LP compressor and HP turbine pressure ratios as shown (Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1) are equal for the respective cases. Furthermore, this condition results in the exhaust temperatures for these added cycles being equal to the compressor discharge temperatures (i.e. ",How is the specific work output for a turbine calculated in an isentropic process?,A5,"The calculation is Wturb = cₚT₃[1 – (1/Pr)^(γ/(γ–1))], with Pr representing the pressure ratio.",1.421875,1.4375,3.234375,1.625,0.6640625

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Reheat (heat addition)

# 5–6 Low pressure (LP) turbine

# (isentropic) expansion

# Figure 3.16 Two-stage reheat expansion process.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Reheat (heat addition)

# 5–6 Low pressure (LP) turbine

# (isentropic) expansion

# Figure 3.16 Two-stage reheat expansion process.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# Reheat (heat addition)

# 5–6 Low pressure (LP) turbine

# (isentropic) expansion

# Figure 3.16 Two-stage reheat expansion process.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

The optimum compressor pressure ratio split is close to the case of maximum specific work for a given overall compressor pressure ratio (i.e. the LP and HP compressor pressure ratios are equal) but at high heat exchanger effectiveness. As the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases, the optimum LP pressure ratio will be lower than that required for maximum specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14.

# 3.2 Reheat gas turbine cycle

The turbine work of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by reheating the gases back to the maximum cycle temperature at some intermediate point. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.15, which shows a schematic representation of a reheat gas turbine cycle. The gases leaving the HP turbine are reheated by burning additional fuel in the reheat combustor to increase the gas temperature to the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, at station 5, before it is expanded in the LP turbine. It was shown in Chapter 2 that the specific work output for a turbine is given by Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄), where T₃ is the turbine entry temperature and T₄ is the turbine exit temperature. For an isentropic process, the specific work can be expressed as:

where Pr is the pressure ratio.

Thus, for a given turbine pressure ratio, Pr, the turbine specific work, Wturb, will increase with T₃. Hence, reheating the turbine, as shown in Figure 3.15, increases the total turbine work output.

# 3.2.1 Optimisation of reheated turbines

The analysis carried out for intercooled compressors in Section 3.1.1 may also be used to determine the optimum pressure ratio split, which will maximise the turbine work output. Referring to Fig. 3.16, for two stages of reheat the turbine-specific work output is given by:

Wturb = cₚ(T₃ – T₄) + cₚ(T₅ – T₆)                                  [3.9]

Since T₅ = T₃ due to reheating, and substituting the HP and overall pressure ratios, Prₕₚ and Prₒ, respectively, into Equation 3.9, for an isentropic process:

Wturb = cₚ T₃ ⎜ 2  – ⌊ 1  ⌋γ/(γ–1) – ⌊ Prₕₚ ⌋γ/(γ–1) ⎜ Prₒ ⎝                 [3.10]

By differentiating Equation 3.10 with respect to Prₕₚ, it can be shown that the maximum turbine work occurs when the HP turbine pressure equals the LP turbine pressure. Thus, the HP turbine pressure ratio Prₕₚ, is given by:

Prhp = Pro                                                    [3.11]

where Prₒ is the overall pressure ratio, which in this case equals the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

# 3.2.2 Thermal efficiency and specific work of an ideal reheat gas turbine

From the discussion in Section 3.2, the specific work of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine may be augmented by the application of reheat.

# 3–4 High pressure (HP) turbine

# 3–5 (isentropic) expansion

# Reheat (heat addition)

# 5–6 Low pressure (LP) turbine

# (isentropic) expansion

# Figure 3.16 Two-stage reheat expansion process.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

The temperature–entropy diagram for such a cycle is shown in Fig. 3.17. Since the ideal cycle is being considered, the thermodynamic processes involved in an ideal reheat gas turbine cycle are:

- 1–2 isentropic compression
- 2–3 constant pressure heat addition
- 3–4 isentropic expansion
- 4–5 constant pressure heat addition
- 5–6 isentropic expansion.

As with the intercooled cycle discussed in Section 3.1.2 above, we can consider the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle consisting of two ideal simple cycles (1–2–3–4′ and 4′–4–5–6) as shown in Fig. 3.17.

Note that the pressure ratio of the ideal simple cycle representing the reheating part of the cycle (4′–4–5–6) has a low pressure ratio and therefore a lower thermal efficiency compared with the base ideal cycle 1–2–3–4′. Thus, by the argument made in Section 3.1.2 when the ideal intercooled cycle was considered, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will be less than that of the ideal simple cycle gas turbine. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the reheat cycle will also depend on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature for the same reason discussed in Section 3.1.2. The more efficient base cycle (1–2–3–4′) produces more of the specific work developed by the reheat cycle as the maximum cycle temperature, T₃, is increased and therefore there is an increase in thermal efficiency. This is illustrated in Figs 3.18 and 3.19, which show the variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with pressure ratio for the reheat cycle.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# 3.2.3 Comparison of performance of the ideal intercooled and reheat cycle

To compare the performance of the ideal intercooled and reheat cycle, it is necessary to consider the performance of the added simple gas turbine cycles to the base cycle when intercooling and reheat is applied. These cycles correspond to (2–3–4–4′) in Fig. 3.11 and to (4′–4–5–6) in Fig. 3.17 for the intercooled and reheat cycles, respectively.

# Complex gas turbine cycle

Since only the optimised case for these added cycles has been considered, the LP compressor and HP turbine pressure ratios as shown (Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1) are equal for the respective cases. Furthermore, this condition results in the exhaust temperatures for these added cycles being equal to the compressor discharge temperatures (i.e. ",What is the purpose of reheating in a gas turbine cycle?,A5,"By reheating, the gas temperature is increased to the maximum cycle temperature prior to LP turbine expansion, increasing work output.",2.46875,2.390625,3.609375,1.5,0.46484375
