in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

# 6.31 Impact of lean premixed (LPM) combustion on NOx reduction.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

# 6.31 Impact of lean premixed (LPM) combustion on NOx reduction.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.

Fuel and air are thoroughly mixed upstream of the combustion zone, whereas the staged combustion discussed above assumed that the fuel and air mixes during the combustion process and the low overall equivalence ratios are primarily responsible for NOₓ reduction. LPM combustion is used extensively in gas-fired engines and the concept can be extended to liquid fuels. However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

However, the fuel must first be completely vaporised before mixing and then burnt in the combustion zone. Such systems are known as lean, pre-mixed, pre-vaporised combustion or LPP combustion. LPP combustion has a tendency to auto-ignite, which is due to the long time periods needed to vaporise and mix the fuel and air. At the high combustor inlet temperatures that occur, high power conditions can result in the mixture igniting before reaching the combustion zone.

# 6.16 Catalytic combustion

Catalytic combustion is receiving a great deal of attention because it has the ability to reduce pollutants to levels far below that which can be achieved by the systems described previously. Fuel and air are mixed thoroughly before entering the catalyst, which promotes chemical reactions and therefore releases the heat of combustion. Catalytic combustion can take place at equivalence ratios that are well below the lean extinction limit encountered in conventional combustion systems. At such low temperatures, the NOₓ levels are reduced dramatically. Figure 6.32 shows a possible schematic representation of a catalytic combustor. An intermediate zone is provided to convert any CO and UHC into products such as CO₂ and H₂O and is followed.

by a dilution zone to prepare the combustor exhaust gases for entry into the turbine section.

At start-up and idle, the compressor delivery temperature may be too low for the catalyst to be effective and a separate combustion chamber may be needed for start-up and during idle operating conditions. Catalytic combustion is still under development. The significant problems to overcome are satisfactory catalyst life and reliability in the harsh and varied operating conditions that prevail in a gas turbine combustor.

It must be pointed out that the turbine entry temperatures (TET) have increased progressively and gas turbines today operate at firing temperatures of 1800 K. At such high temperatures, the potential for emission reduction using catalytic combustion is limited, as stable combustion is possible with other forms of the low emission combustion systems discussed earlier. Since these combustion systems are quite well developed, catalytic combustion is most likely to find application in small units where the TET is below the weak extinction limit. However, if the control system for catalytic combustion is significantly simpler than the DLE combustion system (particularly if overboard bleeds are dispensed with), then there may be a strong case for widespread use of the catalytic combustion in gas turbines, provided the cost of such combustion systems are competitive. It is also worth pointing out that the turbine entry temperature is unlikely to exceed 1800 K because, at higher turbine entry temperatures, NOₓ emissions increase significantly.

# 6.17 Impact of engine configuration on DLE combustion systems

It was stated in Section 6.12 that a variable geometry combustor can be used to maintain the primary zone temperature at a constant level where emissions are low. Gas turbines have also used variable geometry devices such as

# Gas turbine combustion

variable inlet guide vanes and stators in compressors and variable nozzle guide vanes in turbines for controlling the flow through compressors and turbines. Such devices may also be employed in maintaining the flow through combustors so that the combustor fuel–air ratio is constant, thus attaining low emissions at various engine loads.

# 6.17.1 Single-shaft gas turbines

The use of single-shaft gas turbines is widespread in power generation, particularly in combined cycle mode where they operate at constant speeds as required by the electrical power generation system. The use of variable inlet guide vanes is common in such engine configurations as they reduce starting power requirements and have the ability to maintain the exhaust gas temperature at low operating power output condition; this can improve gas turbine thermal efficiency under such conditions.

Maintaining constant exhaust gas temperature also results in the combustion temperature remaining approximately constant, thus having the potential of maintaining a constant primary zone temperature at low engine load. Thus, the incorporation of variable inlet guide vanes in the compressor can achieve all the requirements of variable geometry combustion. It is also possible to increase the combustion temperature at lower load above the design value, helping to maintain CO emissions, which tend to increase due to lower combustion pressure. As a result, variable inlet guide vanes are now a major part of DLE combustion gas turbines as described in Maghon et al.⁸

# 6.17.2 Free power turbines

Gas turbines incorporating free power turbines are widespread in applications such as mechanical drives, where the speed of the load varies significantly with power demand. The (single spool) gas generator, which consists of a compressor, combustor and a turbine, produces high pressure–high temperature gas necessary for the power turbine to generate the required power demanded by the load.

Although compressor variable geometry inlet guide vanes and stators are used widely in such engine configurations, they are there mainly to provide adequate surge margins for satisfactory operation rather than to control the flow through the engine. Thus, parallel staged DLE combustors or combustion systems that attempt to achieve the goals of low emissions in a single stage may use overboard bleeds to maintain the fuel–air ratios at low operating loads to prevent high emissions of CO and UHC and flame out at these operating conditions. This is due to combustor operation at conditions far removed from its design point. In effect, an overboard bleed is being used to maintain the combustion temperature and thus emissions, but at the

# 168 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The loss in engine performance due to overboard bleeds is particularly profound at low ambient temperatures when the maximum engine power available may be constrained by gas generator speed rather than by exhaust gas temperature. During such an operation at constant gas generator speed, there is an inevitable reduction in fuel–air ratio as the ambient temperature decreases, hence increasing the emissions of CO and UHC. The reduction in the fuel–air ratio at these operating conditions also increases the risk of flame out due to the weak extinction limit being exceeded. Thus it may be necessary to bleed combustion air when maximum power demand is called for at such low ambient temperatures. This not only increases the fuel consumption but also reduces the maximum power available. Hence, the performance penalty due to combustion overboard bleeds is more severe at low ambient temperatures.

Variable geometry power turbines were developed and applied widely to regenerative gas turbines for automotive applications in the 1960s. They were needed to improve the off-design fuel efficiency.

in any part of the second stage is never above 0.6. Combustion will continue in the second stage, but the low equivalence ratio will prevent high combustion temperatures in the second zone, hence preventing the formation of NOx but will burn out the UHC and CO.

If the mixing is not thorough, then regions of high enough equivalence ratio will occur in the second stage, resulting in high temperatures giving rise to high levels of NOx, particularly if the equivalence ratios approach unity. Figure 6.30 illustrates the principle of RQL combustion showing the high NOx path due to poor mixing of the reactants and air in the second zone and the low NOx path resulting from good mixing of air and reactants. The concept of RQL combustion has proved difficult to implement in a practical gas turbine.

# 6.15 Lean premixed (LPM) combustion

We have stated that good mixing of the fuel and air results in a high heat release rate, as was found with air blast atomisers in Section 6.6. The high heat release rate also increases the combustion temperature and will result in high NOx emissions. However, when operating at low or lean fuel–air ratios, good mixing will result in homogeneous fuel and air mixtures, thus reducing the probability of regions in the mixture where the fuel–air ratio would be high enough to produce high NOx levels. This will result in significant reductions in NOx emissions and is illustrated in Fig. 6.31.
