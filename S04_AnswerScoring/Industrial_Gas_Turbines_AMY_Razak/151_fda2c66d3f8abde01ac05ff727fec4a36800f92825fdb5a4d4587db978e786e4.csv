The maximum power available from the engine is determined by running the model at some limiting condition such as the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) or speed limit imposed by the manufacturer. Issues on engine control limits are discussed in the next chapter, where engine control systems and the transient performance of gas turbines will be discussed.

The fouling index profile, similar to that shown in Fig. 9.15, has to be determined by monitoring the compressor performance deterioration due to fouling. The lost revenue due to one fouling cycle can be used to extrapolate the lost revenue per annum due to fouling. Infrequent washing will result in increased.
