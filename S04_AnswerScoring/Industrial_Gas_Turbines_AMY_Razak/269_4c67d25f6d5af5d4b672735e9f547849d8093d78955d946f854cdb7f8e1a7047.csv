# 17.3.1 Compressor characteristics and trends in pressure and temperature ratios

As the ambient pressure decreases and the VIGV remains fully opened, it is observed that the air flow rate through the engine decreases (Section 17.2.4). This results in an increase in specific work to compensate for the loss in air flow rate in order to maintain the power output from the gas turbine.
