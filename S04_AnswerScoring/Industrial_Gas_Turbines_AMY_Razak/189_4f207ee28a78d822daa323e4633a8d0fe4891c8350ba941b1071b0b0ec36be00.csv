The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation. In fact, this compressor has six variable stator vanes and one variable inlet guide vane to ensure satisfactory operation of the gas turbine. The variation of these guide vane positions with compressor (quasi) non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.2.

# 11.2 Representation of other non-dimensional parameters

Gas turbines behave in a non-dimensional manner and that is the reason why the unique running line is observed on the compressor characteristic when they operate with a free power turbine. Thus, the variation of non-dimensional parameters such as mass flow and pressure and temperature ratios can be compared with, say, compressor non-dimensional speed. Also any other non-dimensional parameter may be used instead of compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.3 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with speed. Two kinks are observed in the display. One corresponds to the

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

# 11.3 Effects of ambient temperature on engine performance (high-power operating case)

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

# 11.2 Representation of other non-dimensional parameters

Gas turbines behave in a non-dimensional manner and that is the reason why the unique running line is observed on the compressor characteristic when they operate with a free power turbine. Thus, the variation of non-dimensional parameters such as mass flow and pressure and temperature ratios can be compared with, say, compressor non-dimensional speed. Also any other non-dimensional parameter may be used instead of compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.3 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with speed. Two kinks are observed in the display. One corresponds to the

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

# 11.3 Effects of ambient temperature on engine performance (high-power operating case)

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation. In fact, this compressor has six variable stator vanes and one variable inlet guide vane to ensure satisfactory operation of the gas turbine.

Gas turbines behave in a non-dimensional manner and that is the reason why the unique running line is observed on the compressor characteristic when they operate with a free power turbine. Thus, the variation of non-dimensional parameters such as mass flow and pressure and temperature ratios can be compared with, say, compressor non-dimensional speed. Also any other non-dimensional parameter may be used instead of compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

# 11.3 Effects of ambient temperature on engine performance (high-power operating case)

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

# 11.3 Effects of ambient temperature on engine performance (high-power operating case)

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation. In fact, this compressor has six variable stator vanes and one variable inlet guide vane to ensure satisfactory operation of the gas turbine.

Also any other non-dimensional parameter may be used instead of compressor non-dimensional speed.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5.

11.3 Variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with non-dimensional speed.

Kink found in the VSV/VIGV movement shown in Fig. 11.2, which is due to the rapid opening of the VSV/VIGV as the compressor approaches its normal operating speed range. The other kink is due to the choking of the compressor inlet at high compressor non-dimensional speeds. This can also be observed in Fig. 11.1, where the increase in flow with speed is smaller at the high-speed part of the compressor characteristic when compared with the low speed part. Thus, as the compressor inlet chokes, the compressor non-dimensional speeds will collapse into a single line and no increase in non-dimensional flow is possible with any increase in compressor speed. Indeed, such a phenomenon has been observed with turbines, where the non-dimensional flow remains constant after the turbine chokes (see Fig. 5.8 in Chapter 5).

The variation of compressor pressure ratio and non-dimensional temperature rise with compressor non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.4. The kinks are observed again as described above when discussing the non-dimensional flow variation with speed. Because of the choking in the compressor inlet, the compressor pressure ratio flattens and imposes a maximum compressor pressure ratio of about 18. Thus, compressor inlet choking determines the maximum pressure ratio that a compressor can achieve.

Figures 11.5 and 11.6 show the variation of various turbine parameters with compressor non-dimensional speed, and Fig. 11.7 shows the variation of non-dimensional fuel flow and power with compressor non-dimensional speed. A similar picture emerges where the effects of the VSV/VIGV kink and the choking of the compressor inlet are observed. These non-dimensional parameters may be converted to corrected or standard conditions by using the equations described in Section 8.7.1 in Chapter 8.

# 11.3 Effects of ambient temperature on engine performance (high-power operating case)

The engine model can be used to simulate the change in ambient temperature and its impact on engine performance. It has been stated that the simulator is based on a quasi-steady-state model, thus it is possible to subject the model to significant changes in ambient conditions. In practice, however, rapid changes in ambient conditions are not common and could lead to compressor surge.

The pressure ratio of the compressor at design conditions is about 17.5. It was seen in Section 4.10.3 under variable geometry compressors that, at such high-pressure ratios, many stages of variable stator vanes are necessary to prevent compressor surge, particularly during low speed operation. In fact, this compressor has six variable stator vanes and one variable inlet guide vane to ensure satisfactory operation of the gas turbine. The variation of these guide vane positions with compressor (quasi) non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 11.2.

# 11.2 Representation of other non-dimensional parameters

Gas turbines behave in a non-dimensional manner and that is the reason why the unique running line is observed on the compressor characteristic when they operate with a free power turbine. Thus, the variation of non-dimensional parameters such as mass flow and pressure and temperature ratios can be compared with, say, compressor non-dimensional speed. Also any other non-dimensional parameter may be used instead of compressor non-dimensional speed.

Figure 11.3 shows the variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with speed. Two kinks are observed in the display. One corresponds to the
