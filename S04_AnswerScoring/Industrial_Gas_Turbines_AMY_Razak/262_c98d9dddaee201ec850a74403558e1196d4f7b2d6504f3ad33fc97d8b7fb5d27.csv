This represents about an 8% change in ambient pressure corresponding to these days. Gas turbines that operate at high elevations, where the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level, will show a reduced power output. For example, at an elevation of 1000 metres, the ambient pressure would be about 0.9 Bar on an ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) day. However, the ambient temperature at this altitude will be lower in general, thus partly compensating for the reduced power output.
