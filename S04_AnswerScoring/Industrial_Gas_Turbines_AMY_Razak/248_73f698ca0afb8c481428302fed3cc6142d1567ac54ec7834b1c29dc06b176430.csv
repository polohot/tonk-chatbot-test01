The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.

The increased power developed by the turbine increases the stress in the blades due to the increased torque (note turbine speed is constant). Thus, together with the increase in blade temperature, the creep life usage increases. During the period when the engine power output is constant, the turbine blade metal temperature decreases. Although the turbine power output increases during constant power operation, it increases at a lower rate (Fig. 16.4). The reduction in turbine blade metal temperature has a greater effect on reducing creep life usage than the increased torque, which produces increased stress in the turbine blade material. The net effect is a decrease in turbine creep life usage (Fig. 16.10).

Figure 16.11 shows the creep life usage on an ambient temperature basis during this transient.

The turbine creep life usage has been seen to be lower at high ambient temperatures and this is due to the lower turbine pressure ratios resulting in lower turbine entry temperatures while operating at the EGT limit. It is therefore possible to increase the turbine creep life usage under these conditions by increasing the EGT limit as the ambient temperature increases and this is often the case with single-shaft gas turbines. This will improve the engine performance due to the increase in compressor pressure ratio and maximum.
