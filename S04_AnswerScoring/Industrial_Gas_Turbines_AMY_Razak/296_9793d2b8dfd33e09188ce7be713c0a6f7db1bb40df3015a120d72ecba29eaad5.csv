Thus a significant decrease in NOₓ emissions occurs due to the decrease in the primary zone temperature. However, the reduction in primary zone temperature also results in a substantial increase in the formation of CO and is a limiting factor on the amount of water injection. This can be seen in Fig. ",Why is water injection considered an effective method for NOₓ control despite its drawbacks?,A3,"The effectiveness of water injection in NOₓ control lies in its ability to decrease the primary zone temperature, even though it may increase CO formation.",2.140625,2.40625,3.390625,1.625,0.416015625

These two factors have an adverse effect on turbine creep life usage at high ambient temperatures where the gas turbine power output is limited by the EGT. This can be seen in Fig. 19.14. At low ambient temperatures, however, the gas turbine is power limited and the increased flow rate through the turbine will result in.

A decrease in the turbine entry temperature relative to the base rating case. Thus the turbine creep life usage will decrease as can be seen in Fig. 19.14. Unfortunately, since the power is limiting at this ambient condition, water injection is not used unless NOₓ suppression is required. Thus the decrease in creep life usage at low ambient temperature does not occur and water injection may result in an increase in turbine overhauls with increasing maintenance costs. It must also be noted that damage to the combustion system may arise due to water injection, as discussed in Chapter 6.

In spite of these drawbacks, water injection is an effective means of NOₓ control and is quite widely used. Direct injection of water into the primary zone results in the suppression of the primary zone temperature where NOₓ normally forms. Thus a significant decrease in NOₓ emissions occurs due to the decrease in the primary zone temperature. However, the reduction in primary zone temperature also results in a substantial increase in the formation of CO and is a limiting factor on the amount of water injection. This can be seen in Fig. ",Why is water injection considered an effective method for NOₓ control despite its drawbacks?,A4,"Water injection is a popular NOₓ control method as it significantly reduces emissions by cooling the primary zone, despite the risk of higher CO levels.",2.203125,2.46875,3.515625,1.5,0.47265625
