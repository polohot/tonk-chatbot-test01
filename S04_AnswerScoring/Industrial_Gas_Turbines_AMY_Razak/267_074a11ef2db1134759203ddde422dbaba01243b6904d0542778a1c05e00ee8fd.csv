The increases in the compressor pressure and temperature ratios result in an increase in the thermal efficiency, as seen in Fig. 17.10. Thus, low ambient pressures are beneficial when the power demand from the gas turbine does not subject it to an engine operating limit. A similar conclusion was drawn when the ambient pressure transient was considered using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator (Section 12.2). The principle of the closed cycle gas turbine was also discussed, where the system pressure is varied to reduce the power output of the gas turbine while maintaining the thermal efficiency. Closed cycle gas turbines are equally applicable to single-shaft gas turbines and were first implemented using such an engine configuration.

# 17.2.3 Trends in power and efficiency

The increases in the compressor pressure and temperature ratios result in an increase in the thermal efficiency, as seen in Fig. 17.10. Thus, low ambient pressures are beneficial when the power demand from the gas turbine does not subject it to an engine operating limit. A similar conclusion was drawn when the ambient pressure transient was considered using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator (Section 12.2). The principle of the closed cycle gas turbine was also discussed, where the system pressure is varied to reduce the power output of the gas turbine while maintaining the thermal efficiency. Closed cycle gas turbines are equally applicable to single-shaft gas turbines and were first implemented using such an engine configuration.

Figure 17.10 also shows the trends in the gas turbine and generator power.

Thus, low ambient pressures are beneficial when the power demand from the gas turbine does not subject it to an engine operating limit. A similar conclusion was drawn when the ambient pressure transient was considered using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator (Section 12.2).

The increases in the compressor pressure and temperature ratios result in an increase in the thermal efficiency, as seen in Fig. 17.10. Thus, low ambient pressures are beneficial when the power demand from the gas turbine does not subject it to an engine operating limit. A similar conclusion was drawn when the ambient pressure transient was considered using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator (Section 12.2). The principle of the closed cycle gas turbine was also discussed, where the system pressure is varied to reduce the power output of the gas turbine while maintaining the thermal efficiency. Closed cycle gas turbines are equally applicable to single-shaft gas turbines and were first implemented using such an engine configuration.
