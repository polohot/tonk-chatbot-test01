The VIGV starts to open as soon as the set point in power demand from the gas turbine increases, whereas, in the case described in Fig. 20.3, the VIGV starts to open only when the EGT exceeds the set point (650 K) for VIGV control. Thus, there is a period of engine operation when the VIGV remains closed at low gas turbine power outputs, which is absent in the present case.

During the closed loop response, the VIGV sufficiently closes so that the EGT returns to the set point specified for VIGV control. This results in a decrease in compressor capacity by shifting the compressor speed lines to the left, as shown in Fig. 20.16.
