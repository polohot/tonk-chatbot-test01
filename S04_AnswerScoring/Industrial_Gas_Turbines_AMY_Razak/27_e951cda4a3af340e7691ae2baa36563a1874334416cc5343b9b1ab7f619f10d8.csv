The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

2.23 Effect of maximum cycle temperature on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle.

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

2.23 Effect of maximum cycle temperature on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle.

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",At what pressure ratio does the maximum specific work occur when T₃ is 700 K in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A2,The peak specific work is observed at approximately 3 for T₃ = 700 K.,2.09375,2.375,3.578125,1.34375,0.51171875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

Performance of a practical simple gas turbine cycle as a carpet plot for a series of maximum cycle temperatures and pressure ratios.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",At what pressure ratio does the maximum specific work occur when T₃ is 700 K in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A5,"When the temperature T₃ is 700 K, the specific work reaches its maximum at a pressure ratio of 3.",1.6640625,1.765625,3.375,1.4609375,0.6015625

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air

- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

2.23 Effect of maximum cycle temperature on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle.

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",At what pressure ratio does the maximum thermal efficiency occur for a regenerative cycle with a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7 in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A4,3.5 is the pressure ratio where thermal efficiency peaks with a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7.,1.53125,1.421875,3.296875,1.359375,0.57421875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Performance of a practical simple gas turbine cycle as a carpet plot for a series of maximum cycle temperatures and pressure ratios.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",How does increasing the maximum cycle temperature affect the thermal efficiency and specific work in gas turbines according to the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A2,Higher maximum cycle temperatures lead to improved thermal efficiency and greater specific work output.,2.125,2.21875,3.671875,1.53125,0.396484375

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",How does increasing the maximum cycle temperature affect the thermal efficiency and specific work in gas turbines according to the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A3,The thermal efficiency and specific work are enhanced as the maximum cycle temperature rises.,2.171875,2.234375,3.625,1.5546875,0.412109375

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",How does turbine cooling affect the turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature as explained in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A1,"Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature, allowing for higher turbine entry temperatures, but the stator outlet temperature may be significantly lower.",2.109375,2.546875,3.625,1.7421875,0.3828125

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

Performance of a practical simple gas turbine cycle as a carpet plot for a series of maximum cycle temperatures and pressure ratios.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",How does turbine cooling affect the turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature as explained in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A4,"Turbine cooling permits elevated entry temperatures, but the stator outlet temperature is less due to the cooling effect.",2.046875,2.453125,3.640625,1.578125,0.337890625

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",How does turbine cooling affect the turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature as explained in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A5,"The use of cooling allows for increased turbine entry temperatures, though the stator outlet temperature is lowered as a result.",2.4375,2.59375,3.65625,1.5390625,0.443359375

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What are the advantages of steam cooling over air cooling in turbine blades as discussed in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A3,Steam cooling minimizes the temperature decrease across the nozzle guide vane and avoids the flow penalties associated with air cooling.,2.140625,2.171875,3.46875,1.4609375,0.373046875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What are the main drawbacks of the regenerative cycle design mentioned in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A1,"The main drawbacks include lower specific work output, increased bulk and weight due to the heat exchanger, and additional pressure losses.",2.875,2.953125,3.78125,1.421875,0.419921875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What are the main drawbacks of the regenerative cycle design mentioned in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A2,"Regenerative cycles suffer from reduced specific work, added weight and bulk from the heat exchanger, and extra pressure losses.",2.609375,2.53125,3.65625,1.5,0.39453125

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

Performance of a practical simple gas turbine cycle as a carpet plot for a series of maximum cycle temperatures and pressure ratios.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What are the main drawbacks of the regenerative cycle design mentioned in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A5,"Key drawbacks are the decreased specific work, the increased size and weight from the heat exchanger, and additional pressure losses.",2.609375,2.6875,3.671875,1.390625,0.404296875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K

- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle as described in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A2,Higher effectiveness in the heat exchanger leads to greater thermal efficiency in the regenerative cycle.,2.359375,2.375,3.671875,1.3828125,0.30859375

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle as described in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A3,"The thermal efficiency improves as the heat exchanger's effectiveness rises, due to better heat recovery.",2.53125,2.765625,3.765625,1.59375,0.54296875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7).

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle as described in the book 'Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles'?,A5,"The regenerative cycle's thermal efficiency is enhanced with higher heat exchanger effectiveness, as more heat is reclaimed.",2.78125,2.875,3.859375,1.609375,0.61328125

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87

- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the maximum thermal efficiency and at what pressure ratio does it occur when T₃ is 900 K in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A1,The maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8 and is significantly higher than at lower pressure ratios.,1.21875,1.3984375,3.34375,1.421875,0.283203125

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses.

In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work.

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

# 52 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the maximum thermal efficiency and at what pressure ratio does it occur when T₃ is 900 K in the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A4,8 is the optimal pressure ratio for maximum thermal efficiency when T₃ is 900 K.,0.439453125,0.5078125,2.984375,1.0859375,0.3515625

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures.

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

# 2.18 Worked examples

The design point calculation of a simple cycle gas turbine will be considered using three methods. The first method, described by Rogers and Mayhew, is where the gas properties, γ, cₚ and , are considered equal for the compression,

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the significance of the turbine entry temperature (TET) and stator outlet temperature (SOT) in gas turbine performance according to the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A2,"The TET and SOT are key parameters that influence the turbine's efficiency and power, with higher TET improving performance at the cost of needing advanced cooling techniques.",2.078125,2.265625,3.5625,1.8125,0.6015625

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

# Design point data correspond to the following:

- working media is air
- compressor inlet temperature, T₁ = 288 K
- compressor inlet pressure, P₁ = 1.013 Bar
- compressor pressure ratio, Rpc = 20
- compressor isentropic efficiency, ηc = 0.87
- combustor pressure loss, ΔP = 5% of compressor delivery pressure
- combustion efficiency, ηb = 0.99
- turbine entry temperature, T₃ = 1400 K
- turbine isentropic efficiency, ηₜ = 0.9
- inlet and exhaust losses = 0
- fuel is kerosene

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method. ",What is the significance of the turbine entry temperature (TET) and stator outlet temperature (SOT) in gas turbine performance according to the book 'Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance'?,A3,"These temperatures are vital for optimizing turbine performance, where a higher TET enhances efficiency but necessitates cooling to protect turbine blades.",1.6328125,1.671875,3.34375,1.6953125,0.41796875

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

Pressure ratio

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

# 2.18.1 First method

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:

ηth = 270.01 / 673.99 = 0.401

# 2.18.2 Second method

The second method also considers fixed values for γ, cp but uses different values for the compression and expansion processes. These values for the compression process are the same as those used in the first method.

The peak specific work occurs at a pressure ratio lower than that where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs. For example, at a T₃ value of 700 K, the maximum specific work occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3, whereas the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of 4 (see Fig. 2.19). The maximum specific work corresponds to about 44 kJ/kg. When T₃ equals 900 K, the maximum specific work corresponds to about 98 kJ/kg and the pressure ratio is about 5. The maximum thermal efficiency, when T₃ equals 900 K, occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8. At a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio greater than 14, whereas the maximum specific work occurs at about 12. The thermal efficiency and specific work are significantly greater for this case, which corresponds to about 35% and 315 kJ/kg, respectively.

# 2.20 Variation of specific work with pressure ratio.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratio generally increases the thermal efficiency and specific work. The increase in thermal efficiency results in reduced fuel consumption and the increase in specific work reduces the size of the gas turbine. As stated, the values for T₃ and pressure ratios are rather low for a practical gas turbine because of low thermal efficiency, and the gas turbine will be large due to a low specific work output. Currently, gas turbine designs can utilise a maximum cycle temperature up to about 1800 K and pressure ratios up to about 45. This range is illustrated in Fig. 2.21, where the performance of a practical gas turbine is displayed when operating at current values for pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures.

Maximum cycle temperatures are unlikely to exceed 1800 K because at higher temperatures NOₓ emissions become prohibitive, as discussed in Chapter 6. At higher maximum cycle temperatures, there are claims that the thermal efficiency may actually decrease, as reported by Wilcock et al. The changes in gas properties (increase in cp and decrease in γ) of the actual combustion gases at such high temperatures introduce irreversibilities into the cycle and could explain this unexpected performance behaviour.

At a pressure ratio of 20 and a maximum cycle temperature of 1400 K, the thermal efficiency and specific work correspond to about 36% and 300 kJ/kg, respectively. These values are more typical for existing gas turbines. As stated above, gas turbines operating at a maximum cycle temperature of 1800 K and pressure ratio of 40 have been developed with increased compressor and turbine efficiencies, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine further. With such developments, the thermal efficiency of simple cycle gas turbines has increased to about 42%.

# Performance of an actual (practical) regenerative gas turbine cycle

From the analysis of an ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle in Section 2.7, it was shown that the efficiency increases with decrease in pressure ratio, and the limiting value for the thermal efficiency occurs when the pressure ratio tends to unity. The thermal efficiency under this limiting case corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the specific work tends to zero and this limiting case is only of academic interest.

In the forementioned description of the ideal case, it was assumed that the heat exchanger was perfect and therefore had an effectiveness of unity. In a practical cycle, however, the effectiveness is less than unity. When the pressure ratio tends to unity, the imperfection in the heat exchanger will require a finite amount of heat to be supplied to maintain the required value of the maximum cycle temperature, T₄. Since the work output, W, is zero and a finite amount of heat is supplied (Q ≠ 0), the thermal efficiency, W/Q, will be zero.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.22, where the thermal efficiency of a practical regenerative cycle is plotted against pressure ratio. Three cases of effectiveness are shown varying from 0.7 to 0.9. The practical simple cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparative purposes. The value of the maximum cycle temperature T₄ for both the regenerative and simple cycle cases is assumed to be 900 K.

# 2.22 Effect of heat exchanger effectiveness on thermal efficiency.

The pressure ratio where the maximum thermal efficiency occurs is significantly less than that of a simple cycle. Furthermore, the optimum pressure ratio decreases as the heat exchanger effectiveness increases and this is expected, since the actual regenerative cycle tends towards the ideal cycle. Increasing the heat exchanger effectiveness increases the thermal efficiency as more of the waste heat can be recovered.

For a heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.7, the maximum thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 3.5 and the corresponding thermal efficiency is about 28%. When the effectiveness is increased to 0.9, the optimum pressure ratio is about 2.5 and the thermal efficiency is increased to about 36%. The maximum thermal efficiency of the simple cycle is about 23%, requiring a pressure ratio of about 8.

Increasing the maximum cycle temperature has a larger beneficial effect on the performance of the regenerative cycle compared with the simple cycle. This result is because the ideal regenerative cycle thermal efficiency is dependent on the ratio of the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, whereas the ideal simple cycle efficiency is independent of maximum to minimum temperature ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.23, where the variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio is shown for a series of maximum cycle temperatures. The heat exchanger effectiveness is kept constant at a value of 0.8. The maximum cycle temperature is increased from 700 K to 900 K in steps of 100 K.

The pressure ratio corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency increases with the maximum cycle temperature T₄. However, the increase in this pressure ratio is greater for the simple cycle compared with the regenerative cycle. The above analysis shows that regenerative cycle gas turbines are

More efficient than simple cycle gas turbines and their thermal efficiency increases significantly with increase in maximum cycle temperature and heat exchanger effectiveness. Furthermore, the pressure ratios required are smaller than that required by a simple cycle gas turbine to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency.

The specific work output curves for a regenerative cycle will be similar to those of a simple cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.20. However, the specific work of the regenerative cycle will be less than that of a simple cycle engine, resulting in a bigger gas turbine due to lower pressure ratios employed by the regenerative gas turbine. The addition of the heat exchanger will also add to the bulk and weight of the engine. Furthermore, the heat exchanger introduces an additional pressure loss in the heat addition and heat rejection processes – as discussed later. These are the main drawbacks to the regenerative cycle design. However, the lower pressure ratios required may result in a smaller compressor, compensating for part of the increased weight and bulk. The low compressor pressure ratios also result in colder cooling air temperatures that may be needed for turbine blade cooling and this will reduce the amount of cooling air requirements, as discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure 2.24 shows a carpet plot illustrating the variation of the thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures T₄. A heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.9 is assumed and a heat exchanger pressure loss of 5% is also assumed for both the hot and cold side, respectively. The values for the maximum cycle temperatures used are more practical and therefore give an indication of what a practical regenerative cycle can achieve in terms of performance.

Pressure losses in the heat exchanger, thermal efficiencies of over 50% are possible with a regenerative cycle, which compares with about 42% for a simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.16.1 Effect of heat exchanger pressure losses on thermal efficiency for a regenerative cycle

The discussion in Section 2.10 described the effect of pressure losses during the heat addition and heat rejection processes on gas turbine performance.

When a heat exchanger is added to the simple gas turbine cycle, the decrease in thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is generally less sensitive to these losses. The reason for the reduced sensitivity of the regenerative cycle thermal efficiency to pressure losses is primarily due to the reduction in heat input as the pressure losses increase. This is illustrated on the temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. 2.25. As the pressure losses increase, there is also an increase in the turbine (expander) exit temperature. Thus the heat available for recovery by the heat exchanger increases. This results in a reduction in the heat addition to the regenerative cycle, hence partly compensating for the reduced specific work due to the increased pressure loss. In a simple-cycle gas turbine the heat input is unaffected by increased pressure losses and consequently the thermal efficiency loss is greater and decreases proportionally with the decrease in specific work. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.26, which shows the loss in thermal efficiency due to the pressure.

# 2.17 Turbine entry temperature and stator outlet temperature

The maximum cycle temperatures discussed previously have varied from 1200 K to 1800 K. It has also been shown that the higher the maximum cycle temperature, the better the performance of the gas turbine cycles. It is the turbine that is subjected to high gas temperatures and the materials used in the manufacture of the turbine must be capable of withstanding such temperatures. This issue is illustrated in Fig. 2.27, which shows the trends in material temperature capability and the significant increase in turbine blade temperature that has occurred over the years. Further significant increase in gas temperature, known as the turbine entry temperature (TET), is also possible by employing cooling of the turbine, also shown in Fig. 2.27.

Turbine cooling reduces the blade temperature such that the turbine creep life remains satisfactory during operation. This technology is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7). The cooling air is generally divided into three parts and is used to cool the stator or nozzle guide vane, the rotor and the disc, as shown in Fig. 2.28. After carrying out the cooling function, the cooling air enters the gas stream at the stator and rotor trailing edge. The mixing of the stator cooling air with the gas stream reduces the rotor inlet temperature and therefore requires a higher TET to obtain the required power from the turbine as all the work in a turbine stage is done by the rotor. Thus the rotor inlet temperature is an important parameter and many manufacturers refer to this temperature as the stator outlet temperature (SOT) or the first rotor temperature. The SOT may be as much as 150 degrees lower than the TET. The rotor cooling air is unavailable for producing power and would be.

Stator cooling air

Rotor and disc cooling air

The disc cooling air may enter the gas stream and contribute to turbine power production. The amount of turbine cooling air required depends on the material used for the manufacture of the turbine blades, the TET and the cooling air temperature. For high performance gas turbines, the amount of cooling bled from the high pressure stages of the compressor can amount to 15% of the total compressor flow. The turbine cooling air, of course, bypasses the combustion system of the gas turbine. Turbine cooling also compromises the performance of the turbine and thus the performance of the gas turbine engine and these matters are discussed further in Section 5.9.

Recently, steam cooling has been considered and applied to turbine cooling. Here, the steam cooling system is external to the gas turbine, the drop in gas temperature across the nozzle guide vane is significantly smaller, and the SOT is typically only about 50 degrees lower than the TET with steam cooling systems. Furthermore, the penalties of loss in flow through the turbine due to air cooling systems do not apply to steam-cooled blades. A water cooling system, similar to that of steam cooling, can also be considered but such systems have proved less reliable and may present corrosion problems and produce scale deposits, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness.

heat addition and expansion processes. The second method corresponds to that discussed by Saravanamutto et al.³ where fixed but different values for cₚ and γ are used. The heat addition is determined from combustion charts as shown in Fig. 2.17. In the third method the enthalpy–entropy approach is used, as discussed in Section 2.12. The heat input is determined by using the combustion charts shown in Figure 2.17. The effect of increased turbine flow rate due to the addition of fuel in the combustor is ignored as this increased flow rate can approximately be assumed to be lost due to leakages and cooling effects.

For the first method, the values for γ, cₚ and are set as 1.005 and 1.4, respectively, for the compression heat addition and expansion process present in the gas turbine cycle.

From Equation 2.29 the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, is calculated by:

T₂ = T₁ + T₁ ⌈ (γ – 1) / (Rpc) γ – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 288 + 288 ⌈ (20) 1 / 3.5 – 1 ⌉

T₂ = 736.07 K

The compressor specific work input, Wc:

Wc = 1.005 × (736.07 – 288) = 450.31 kJ/kg

and the compressor discharge pressure, P₂ equals:

P₂ = P₁ × Rpc = 1.013 × 20 = 20.26 Bar-A

The turbine inlet pressure, P₃ is equal to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

P₃ = P₂ × (1 – ΔP/100) = 20.26 × (1 – 5/100) = 19.247 Bar-A

Therefore the turbine pressure ratio is given by:

Rpt = 19.247/1.013 = 19

From Equation 2.31 the turbine exit temperature is given by:

T4 = T1 - (T3 × ηt × (1 - (1/Rpt)))

T4 = 1400 - 1400 × 0.9 × (1 - (1/19)) = 683.266K

The turbine specific work output, Wt is:

Wt = 1.005 × (1400 - 683.266) = 720.318 kJ/kg

The specific heat input, Qin is given by Equation 2.12:

Qin = 1.005 × (1400 - 736.07)/0.99 = 673.99 kJ/kg

The net turbine specific work, Wnet = Wt – Wc

Wnet = 720.318 – 450.31 = 270.01 kJ/kg

The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net turbine specific work to the heat input. The thermal efficiency, ηth, is therefore:
