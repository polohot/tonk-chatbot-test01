The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18. The open and closed loop responses of the VIGV control system is clearly shown for each step increase in the power demand from the generator. The corresponding trends in gas turbine temperatures are shown in Fig. ",How are VIGV systems utilized in dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines?,A1,"VIGV systems in DLE combustor gas turbines maintain constant EGT with decreasing power output, keeping combustion temperature stable to reduce emissions.",1.578125,1.796875,3.171875,1.671875,0.328125

The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18. The open and closed loop responses of the VIGV control system is clearly shown for each step increase in the power demand from the generator. The corresponding trends in gas turbine temperatures are shown in Fig. ",How does the VIGV opening affect the compressor characteristic and surge line?,A4,"The compressor's operating characteristics and surge line position are modified by the VIGV's opening, as detailed.",1.2109375,1.4609375,3.03125,1.375,-0.09130859375

The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18.

The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18. The open and closed loop responses of the VIGV control system is clearly shown for each step increase in the power demand from the generator.

The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18.

The compressor and turbine. However, the maximum to minimum cycle temperature, T₃/T₁, is higher when the EGT set point for VIGV control is increased. The net effect on the gas turbine thermal efficiency is minimal, although a slight decrease in thermal efficiency occurs when operating with a higher EGT limit for VIGV control. It is only when a heat exchanger is incorporated or in combined cycle applications that a significant improvement in the thermal efficiency will occur at part loads due to the increased exhaust heat being available for recovery via the heat exchangers.

# 20.2.2 VIGV systems for dry low emission (DLE) combustor gas turbines

Apart from reducing starting power requirements of large gas turbines, VIGV systems are used widely in dry low emission combustion (DLE) engines. It was stated in Chapter 6 that gas turbine emissions such as NOₓ and CO can be reduced significantly if the combustion temperature is kept within strict limits, which means the air–fuel ratio should remain approximately constant with the change in load. The application of VIGV to maintain a constant EGT with the decrease in engine power output does indeed maintain the turbine entry temperature and combustion temperature approximately constant. This is exploited in the manufacture of single-shaft gas turbines employing DLE combustion systems.

The suitability of the use of VIGV for DLE combustion gas turbines will now be demonstrated using the simulator. The power demand from the gas turbine is increased in steps of approximately 2.5 MW, so that the normal power range of the gas turbine is covered as shown in Fig. 20.17. The increase in the power demand results in the VIGV responding as described in Section 20.2.1 and as shown in Fig. 20.18. The open and closed loop responses of the VIGV control system is clearly shown for each step increase in the power demand from the generator.
