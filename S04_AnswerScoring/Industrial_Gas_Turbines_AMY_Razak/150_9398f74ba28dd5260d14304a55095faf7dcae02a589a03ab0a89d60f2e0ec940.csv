It has been stated that fault indices indicate change in component characteristics due to faults, while examining the trends of fault indices gives diagnostics. Such data and information are invaluable in performing RCA, as the onset of damage and faults in gas turbines can be detected and action taken before engine failure occurs. For example, compressor fouling or seal wear shown in Figs 9.15 and 9.18 are expected during engine operation and would not normally result in engine failure.

Although we have stated that compressor fouling does not normally result in engine failure, the build-up of dirt and deposits during engine operation reduces the capacity and efficiency of the compressor as discussed.

Downtime for washing and cost will affect production adversely due to the unavailability of the engine. Infrequent washing will also reduce production and therefore profit due to the decrease in engine performance due to fouling. Thus there is a need to optimise the compressor wash frequency such that the loss in profit or revenue due to fouling and washing is minimised.

The downtime for engine washing will affect revenue directly. The cost of the wash needs to be added to this lost revenue to determine the total cost due to compressor washing. The lost revenue per annum due to engine washing will be equal to the lost revenue per engine wash, times the number of washes per annum, and will increase with wash frequency, as shown in Fig. 9.19.

It has been stated that fault indices indicate change in component characteristics due to faults, while examining the trends of fault indices gives diagnostics. Such data and information are invaluable in performing RCA, as the onset of damage and faults in gas turbines can be detected and action taken before engine failure occurs. For example, compressor fouling or seal wear shown in Figs 9.15 and 9.18 are expected during engine operation and would not normally result in engine failure. But blade rubs and hot end damage, as shown in Figs 9.16 and 9.17 are more serious.

Although we have stated that compressor fouling does not normally result in engine failure, the build-up of dirt and deposits during engine operation reduces the capacity and efficiency of the compressor as discussed.

Downtime for washing and cost will affect production adversely due to the unavailability of the engine. Infrequent washing will also reduce production and therefore profit due to the decrease in engine performance due to fouling. Thus there is a need to optimise the compressor wash frequency such that the loss in profit or revenue due to fouling and washing is minimised.

The downtime for engine washing will affect revenue directly. The cost of the wash needs to be added to this lost revenue to determine the total cost due to compressor washing. The lost revenue per annum due to engine washing will be equal to the lost revenue per engine wash, times the number of washes per annum, and will increase with wash frequency, as shown in Fig. 9.19.

Although we have stated that compressor fouling does not normally result in engine failure, the build-up of dirt and deposits during engine operation reduces the capacity and efficiency of the compressor as discussed. Thus a regular clean, normally by washing the compressor, is required to maintain production and profitability. If compressor washing is too frequent, the increase

# Gas turbine performance deterioration

Downtime for washing and cost will affect production adversely due to the unavailability of the engine. Infrequent washing will also reduce production and therefore profit due to the decrease in engine performance due to fouling. Thus there is a need to optimise the compressor wash frequency such that the loss in profit or revenue due to fouling and washing is minimised.

The downtime for engine washing will affect revenue directly. The cost of the wash needs to be added to this lost revenue to determine the total cost due to compressor washing. The lost revenue per annum due to engine washing will be equal to the lost revenue per engine wash, times the number of washes per annum, and will increase with wash frequency, as shown in Fig. 9.19.
