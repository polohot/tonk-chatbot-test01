# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

In gas turbines, the exhaust flow normally has a higher thermal capacity due to the higher temperatures, and different gas composition due to combustion. Typically, the values of thermal capacity ratio, C, for gas turbines are in the range of 0.97 to 1.0 and this restricts the effectiveness of the heat exchanger to about 0.9. Currently, regenerative gas turbines are not very common due to the improved performance of the simple cycle gas turbine. However, they will appear in the future, particularly when intercooling and reheat gas turbines are considered as the means to increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine to over 50%. These features will be discussed in Chapter 3. Regenerative gas turbines are also capable of achieving better off-design thermal efficiency when compared with the simple cycle gas turbine. They are likely to appear in mechanical drive and naval applications, where a substantial amount of operation may occur at reduced power conditions.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

However, they will appear in the future, particularly when intercooling and reheat gas turbines are considered as the means to increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine to over 50%.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

In gas turbines, the exhaust flow normally has a higher thermal capacity due to the higher temperatures, and different gas composition due to combustion. Typically, the values of thermal capacity ratio, C, for gas turbines are in the range of 0.97 to 1.0 and this restricts the effectiveness of the heat exchanger to about 0.9. Currently, regenerative gas turbines are not very common due to the improved performance of the simple cycle gas turbine. However, they will appear in the future, particularly when intercooling and reheat gas turbines are considered as the means to increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine to over 50%. These features will be discussed in Chapter 3. Regenerative gas turbines are also capable of achieving better off-design thermal efficiency when compared with the simple cycle gas turbine.

# 2.15 Performance of an actual (practical) simple cycle gas turbine

The above analysis discussed the performance of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine where the compression and expansion were assumed to be reversible. The effects of irreversibility were also discussed and it was shown that the thermal efficiency for an actual cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio (T3/T1) and on the pressure ratio. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19, where the thermal efficiency is plotted for a series of maximum cycle temperatures (T3). Note T1 is set to 288 K. These curves have been drawn for a compressor and turbine polytropic efficiency of 87%, respectively.

Three values of T3 varying from 700 K to 900 K, enable comparison of the performance with the ideal simple cycle as discussed in Section 2.6. The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a maximum cycle

Simple gas turbine thermal efficiency varying with pressure ratio.

The temperature of 1400 K is also shown and is likely to be found in existing gas turbines. The ideal cycle thermal efficiency is also shown for comparison. Unlike the ideal cycle case, the thermal efficiency initially increases with pressure ratio and then decreases as the pressure ratio is further increased. The thermal efficiency therefore peaks and the peak thermal efficiency, and the pressure ratio at which it occurs, also increase with T₃. For example, when T₃ equals 700 K, the peak efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 4 and corresponds to about 15%. At a T₃ value of 900 K, the peak thermal efficiency occurs at a pressure ratio of about 8 and the peak thermal efficiency is about 24%.

Although the specific work of an ideal cycle is dependent on the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio, the effect of irreversibility is to reduce the specific work, as illustrated in Fig. 2.20.
