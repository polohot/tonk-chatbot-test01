# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

This difference is referred to as the proportional offset, which reduces as the proportional band decreases.

# 15.2 Proportional and integral action

Integral action is essentially a summation or integration process on the residual error left by the proportional action (proportional offset). This action (automatic reset as discussed in Chapter 10) results in reducing the error to zero and therefore achieving the required generator output as specified by the set point. Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

The trend in power due to the integral action for a set point change from 1 MW to 19 MW is shown in Fig. 15.2. Initially, only proportional action is...

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

# 15.2 Proportional and integral action

Integral action is essentially a summation or integration process on the residual error left by the proportional action (proportional offset). This action (automatic reset as discussed in Chapter 10) results in reducing the error to zero and therefore achieving the required generator output as specified by the set point. Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

The trend in power due to the integral action for a set point change from 1 MW to 19 MW is shown in Fig. 15.2. Initially, only proportional action is...

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

This difference is referred to as the proportional offset, which reduces as the proportional band decreases. The manual reset discussed in Chapter 10 may be applied to remove the proportional offset (not available in the simulator).

# 15.2 Proportional and integral action

Integral action is essentially a summation or integration process on the residual error left by the proportional action (proportional offset). This action (automatic reset as discussed in Chapter 10) results in reducing the error to zero and therefore achieving the required generator output as specified by the set point. Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached.

Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

The trend in power due to the integral action for a set point change from 1 MW to 19 MW is shown in Fig. 15.2. Initially, only proportional action is...

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

The manual reset discussed in Chapter 10 may be applied to remove the proportional offset (not available in the simulator).

# 15.2 Proportional and integral action

Integral action is essentially a summation or integration process on the residual error left by the proportional action (proportional offset). This action (automatic reset as discussed in Chapter 10) results in reducing the error to zero and therefore achieving the required generator output as specified by the set point. Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

The trend in power due to the integral action for a set point change from 1 MW to 19 MW is shown in Fig. 15.2. Initially, only proportional action is...

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

This difference is referred to as the proportional offset, which reduces as the proportional band decreases. The manual reset discussed in Chapter 10 may be applied to remove the proportional offset (not available in the simulator).

# 15.2 Proportional and integral action

Integral action is essentially a summation or integration process on the residual error left by the proportional action (proportional offset). This action (automatic reset as discussed in Chapter 10) results in reducing the error to zero and therefore achieving the required generator output as specified by the set point. Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

The trend in power due to the integral action for a set point change from 1 MW to 19 MW is shown in Fig. 15.2. Initially, only proportional action is...

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never

Proportional offset is the difference between the generator set point and generator power output. PB = Proportional band.

reached by the generator output and pure proportional action normally leaves a difference between the generator output and the set point. This difference is referred to as the proportional offset, which reduces as the proportional band decreases. The manual reset discussed in Chapter 10 may be applied to remove the proportional offset (not available in the simulator).

# 15.2 Proportional and integral action

Integral action is essentially a summation or integration process on the residual error left by the proportional action (proportional offset). This action (automatic reset as discussed in Chapter 10) results in reducing the error to zero and therefore achieving the required generator output as specified by the set point. Hence both proportional and integral actions are required in control systems if the specified set point and therefore the desired power output is to be achieved. The value of the integral gain is very important, as a small gain will result in prohibitively long time periods before the set point is reached. Too large an integral gain will result in excessive oscillatory response, again resulting in too long a time period before the required set point is reached. Such oscillatory response will also have a detrimental effect on turbine creep life due to overshoots in speeds and temperatures above the steady-state values and can cause unexpected trips in order to protect the engine.

The trend in power due to the integral action for a set point change from 1 MW to 19 MW is shown in Fig. 15.2. Initially, only proportional action is...

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10, the principles of gas turbine control were discussed where it was stated that the change in engine power is accomplished by altering the energy input to the gas turbine. This is achieved by varying the fuel flow into the combustion system until the desired power output is reached. It has also been stated that this change in power output from the gas turbine should be accomplished without any detrimental effect to the gas turbine. The principle of a simple PID control system was introduced, together with the concept of low signal select. Such a simple control system has been implemented in this gas turbine simulator and much of what was discussed in Chapter 10 will be simulated to illustrate the principles of gas turbine control systems. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to illustrate some of the features of control systems applied to gas turbine control. A PID control system contains the P – proportional, I – integral and D – derivative terms and is often referred to as a three-term control system.

# 15.1 Proportional action

Pure proportional action results in the proportional band acting on the error that is determined by the difference of the power output from the electrical generator and the set point, which represents the power required by the generator. Pure proportional action leaves an offset as illustrated by Fig. 15.1, which shows the trends in power due to a step change in the required power output of the generator from 1 MW to 19 MW. Pure proportional action is achieved in the simulator by switching off the integral output in the engine control setting option.

The trends in power as shown in Fig. 15.1 have been generated for three values of proportional band and correspond to 100%, 75% and 50%. As the proportional band decreases, which corresponds to an increase in proportional gain, there is an increase in output from the process, which in this case is the electrical generator power output. However, the set point of 19 MW is never
