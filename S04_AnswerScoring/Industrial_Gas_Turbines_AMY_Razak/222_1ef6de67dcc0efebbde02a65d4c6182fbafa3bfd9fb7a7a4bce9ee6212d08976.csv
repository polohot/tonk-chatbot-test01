It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, hence combustion pressure and primary zone temperature, decrease due to this degradation, thereby resulting in a decrease in NO₂ and CO.

Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine. The running line when no performance deterioration is present is also shown in the figure. The figure also shows the operating points for both these cases.

Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine. The running line when no performance deterioration is present is also shown in the figure. The figure also shows the operating points for both these cases.

Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine.

Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine. The running line when no performance deterioration is present is also shown in the figure. The figure also shows the operating points for both these cases.

The maximum power available from the engine, due to the gas generator turbine hot end damage, is about 18.8 MW. If the engine was run at this power, but when no engine degradation is present, then a further decrease in NOₓ would be observed. Thus, in real terms, hot end damage does result in an increase in these emissions, particularly of NOₓ and CO₂.

Displacement of running line due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine

It was discussed in Section 8.2 that decreasing the swallowing capacity (non-dimensional flow) of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line on the compressor characteristic towards surge. Conversely, an increase in the capacity of the gas generator turbine would shift the running line away from surge. However, the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency would shift the running line towards surge. This can be demonstrated by running the simulator where only the effect of reducing the gas generator turbine efficiency fault index by 2% is considered.

The effect of increasing the capacity of the turbine dominates because the shift in the running line due to the fall in gas generator turbine efficiency is small. Thus, the net effect on the running line of the compressor characteristic is a slight shift away from surge.

This is seen in Fig. 13.35, which shows the running line on the compressor characteristic when hot end damage is present in the gas generator turbine. The running line when no performance deterioration is present is also shown in the figure. The figure also shows the operating points for both these cases.

The variation of the compressor non-dimensional flow with its non-dimensional speed is shown in Fig. 13.36.

It has been observed that the compressor discharge pressure, hence combustion pressure and primary zone temperature, decrease due to this degradation, thereby resulting in a decrease in NO₂ and CO. The decrease in CO₂ is primarily due to the decrease in fuel flow resulting from hot end damage to the gas generator turbine. However, the increase in CO₂ emission index implies an increase in CO₂ emission in real terms.

The maximum power available from the engine, due to the gas generator turbine hot end damage, is about 18.8 MW.
