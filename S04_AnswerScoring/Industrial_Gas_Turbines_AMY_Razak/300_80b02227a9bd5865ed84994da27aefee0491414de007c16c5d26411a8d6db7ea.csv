Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds.

The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant.

When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic.

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds.

In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic.

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Also results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. This power increases substantially from about 28 MW to about 45 MW, as shown in Fig. 20.5 due to the opening of VIGV. The turbine produces the power required by the compressor during normal operation; however, during starting of the gas turbine, the turbine power output is very small and a significant amount.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds.

Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant.

The turbine produces the power required by the compressor during normal operation; however, during starting of the gas turbine, the turbine power output is very small and a significant amount.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic.

The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds.

In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant.

Therefore, the cooler size has to be optimised for maximum gain in power output due to turbine inlet cooling.

In a single-shaft gas turbine, the maximum power limit is reached at a lower ambient temperature (at about 2 degrees Celsius). Thus a greater benefit from turbine inlet cooling would be achieved with the single-shaft gas turbine by cooling the turbine inlet air down to 10 degrees Celsius. Cooling the compressor inlet air to lower temperatures increases the risk of the formation of ice, particularly at high humidity, which occurs due to turbine inlet cooling. Such ice formation can break away and enter the compressor, which may damage the engine. Therefore, in practice, it is unlikely that we would consider turbine inlet cooling much lower than 10 degrees Celsius.

# Simulation of engine control system performance

In Chapter 10 the principles of engine control and its function in preventing the engine from exceeding maximum limiting values, thereby protecting the engine from damage, were discussed. The principles of engine controls using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator were illustrated. Much of what was discussed using the two-shaft gas turbine simulator can be demonstrated with the single-shaft gas turbine simulator and similar conclusions drawn with respect to the performance of the fuel control system. However, it is the control of the VIGV in a single-shaft gas turbine that differs primarily from the two-shaft gas turbine. The problems associated with the control of the VIGV will therefore be demonstrated and the means to overcome these difficulties using the single-shaft gas turbine simulator, as discussed in Chapter 10, will be described.

# 20.1 VIGV control system simulation

One of the advantages of using a VIGV is that it reduces the starting power requirement due to the decreased mass flow rate through the compressor when the VIGV is closed. The VIGV is full opened during the normal operating range so that the mass flow rate through the engine is increased, so helping to achieve the designed power output of the gas turbine. This is accomplished by controlling the VIGV system independently of the fuel control system, where the VIGV modulates to maintain a certain value for the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The limit or set point for the EGT may be at a value below the maximum/limiting value for the EGT needed to protect the engine. When the EGT is above the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV will be fully opened, enabling the engine to achieve its designed power output. When the EGT is below this set point, the VIGV will be fully closed, hence reducing starting power requirements.

The operation of the VIGV control system is illustrated by subjecting the single-shaft gas turbine simulator to a step change in power demand from the

# Industrial gas turbines – single-shaft

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds. Since the EGT exceeds the set point for VIGV control, the VIGV starts to open just after 23 seconds (Fig. 20.2) in order to maintain the EGT at 650 K (set point). The VIGV continues to open as the EGT increases to achieve the power demand by the generator and is fully opened after about 28 seconds. The continuous increase in EGT can be seen in Fig. 20.1, but the rate of increase decreases during the period when the VIGV is opening. In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

generator by increasing the power demand from 1 MW to 60 MW. The EGT set point for the VIGV control is 650 K and the maximum EGT limit is 825 K. The increase in power demand from the generator results in an increase in the EGT, which corresponds to T₄, as shown in Fig. 20.1, where it exceeds the VIGV set point after 23 seconds.

In fact, the EGT falls slightly during the period when the VIGV is opening, before increasing to the maximum limiting value of 825 K. Figure 20.2 also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, where a decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N/√T₃, is observed, due to the increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃, since the turbine speed, N, remains constant. The compressor non-dimensional speed, N/√T₁, remains constant since the ambient temperature, and hence T₁, do not change during this simulation.

The opening of the VIGV results in a change in the compressor characteristic, where the capacity of the compressor increases. This is shown in Fig. 20.3 where the operating points for when the VIGV is fully closed, fully opened and the period when the VIGV is opening are marked clearly on the compressor characteristic. Note that the compressor non-dimensional flow and hence flow capacity increase as the VIGV opens.

The increase in flow capacity results in an increase in the compressor flow rate, shown as a trend in Fig. 20.4.

20.5 Increase in compressor power absorbed due to opening of the VIGV.

Also results in an increase in the compressor power absorbed. This power increases substantially from about 28 MW to about 45 MW, as shown in Fig. 20.5 due to the opening of VIGV. The turbine produces the power required by the compressor during normal operation; however, during starting of the gas turbine, the turbine power output is very small and a significant amount.

Change in power demand from generator and variation of gas turbine thermal efficiency due to increased power demand.

of starting power must be provided by an external source as discussed in Chapter 10. Thus, closing the VIGV during starting will result in a significant decrease in the starting power requirements.
