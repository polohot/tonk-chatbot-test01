# 7.3 Off-design performance prediction of a two-shaft gas turbine with a free power turbine

Gas turbines employing free power turbines are widely used where the speed of the load changes significantly. Applications where the load speed changes are pumps, gas compressors and fixed pitch propellers used in marine propulsion. They are generally designed for smaller power ranges (up to about 50 MW) compared with single shaft gas turbines and are also employed in power generation when no single shaft gas turbine is available in this power range. A schematic representation of a two-shaft gas turbine using a free power turbine is shown in Fig. 7.5. There is no mechanical coupling between the gas generator turbine and the power turbine but there exists a strong fluid or aerodynamic coupling between the gas generator turbine and the power turbine.

The required power output, gas turbine speed, N, compressor inlet pressure, P1, temperature, T1, and humidity are specified. The temperature and humidity are used to determine gas constant R and the isentropic index γ, as discussed in Chapter 2. We shall ignore inlet and exhaust losses and therefore P4 = P1. For simplicity we shall also ignore any turbine blade cooling air requirements on engine performance.
