This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

# 3.6

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4.

Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency.

The variation of optimised HP turbine pressure ratio with overall pressure ratio to achieve maximum thermal efficiency is illustrated in Fig. 3.23. The figure shows the variation of HP turbine pressure ratios for two maximum cycle temperatures. Particularly at low maximum cycle temperatures, the increase in compressor pressure ratio increases the effects of irreversibility, thus the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio increases with the increase in overall pressure ratio.

A schematic representation of such a reheat–regenerative cycle is shown in Fig. 3.24. The reheat–regenerative gas turbine recovers some of the exhaust heat from the LP turbine via the heat exchanger.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

# 3.2.5 Ideal reheat and regenerative cycle

The thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle can be increased by the addition of a heat exchanger. A schematic representation of such a reheat–regenerative cycle is shown in Fig. 3.24. The reheat–regenerative gas turbine recovers some of the exhaust heat from the LP turbine via the heat exchanger. The compressor discharge air is heated ideally from T₂ to T₇, i.e.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.

The thermodynamic processes for a reheated regenerative cycle may be displayed on the temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 3.25.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle can be increased by the addition of a heat exchanger. A schematic representation of such a reheat–regenerative cycle is shown in Fig. 3.24. The reheat–regenerative gas turbine recovers some of the exhaust heat from the LP turbine via the heat exchanger. The compressor discharge air is heated ideally from T₂ to T₇, i.e.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle can be increased by the addition of a heat exchanger. A schematic representation of such a reheat–regenerative cycle is shown in Fig. 3.24. The reheat–regenerative gas turbine recovers some of the exhaust heat from the LP turbine via the heat exchanger.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

This also results in the maximum to minimum temperature ratios for the added cycle being the same. Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

Thus the thermal efficiencies of these added cycles are indeed the same due to the same compressor pressure ratio but they are less than those for the base cycle due to the higher compressor pressure ratio of the base cycle as explained above. The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

The specific work of the added cycles are, however, different and the reheat cycle will produce a larger specific work which is due to the higher minimum temperature of this cycle compared with the corresponding case for the intercooled cycle (i.e. T₄′ > T₁). Also, see Equation 2.20, which describes the specific work in terms of cycle pressure ratio, temperature ratio and minimum temperature. Thus the reheat cycle will have a higher specific work but lower thermal efficiency compared with the intercooled cycle as shown in Fig. 3.4 and 3.18, which show the thermal efficiencies of the intercooled and reheat cycles respectively. However, a comparison of Fig. 3.5 and 3.19 shows that the reheat cycle has a higher specific work output.

# 3.2.4 Practical reheat cycle

It was shown in Section 3.1.3 that, when irreversibilities are considered in the compression, expansion and heat transfer processes, intercooling can increase the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine. Referring to Fig. 3.20 a similar argument can be made when the effects of irreversibilities are considered for a practical reheat gas turbine cycle. Thus the thermal efficiency of the reheat gas turbine can exceed the thermal efficiency of a practical simple cycle gas turbine, particularly at lower maximum cycle temperatures.

This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3.21 with Fig. 2.21 in Chapter 2, which shows the variation of thermal efficiency with specific work for a series of overall pressure ratios and maximum cycle temperatures for practical reheat and simple cycles respectively. The curves in Fig. 3.21 are optimised for maximum thermal efficiency. When the practical reheat cycle is optimised for maximum specific work, there is a significant loss in thermal efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3.22.

The simple cycle (1–2–3–4) develops zero work, but requires a finite amount of heat, thus zero thermal efficiency. Reheating the cycle (1–2–3–5–6–7) now produces positive work. Although the heat input has increased, the positive work done gives a thermal efficiency greater than zero. Thus, reheat can increase thermal efficiency of a practical reheat cycle.

# 3.21 Variation of thermal efficiency with specific work when optimised for maximum thermal efficiency.

The variation of optimised HP turbine pressure ratio with overall pressure ratio to achieve maximum thermal efficiency is illustrated in Fig. 3.23. The figure shows the variation of HP turbine pressure ratios for two maximum cycle temperatures. Particularly at low maximum cycle temperatures, the increase in compressor pressure ratio increases the effects of irreversibility, thus the optimum HP turbine pressure ratio increases with the increase in overall pressure ratio.

# 3.2.5 Ideal reheat and regenerative cycle

The thermal efficiency of the ideal reheat gas turbine cycle can be increased by the addition of a heat exchanger. A schematic representation of such a reheat–regenerative cycle is shown in Fig. 3.24. The reheat–regenerative gas turbine recovers some of the exhaust heat from the LP turbine via the heat exchanger. The compressor discharge air is heated ideally from T₂ to T₇, i.e.

The temperature at station 3 is equal to the LP turbine exhaust temperature, T₇. The air leaving the regenerator at station 3 is heated further, normally by burning fuel in the combustor until it reaches the maximum cycle temperature at station 4. The gases at station 7 are cooled in the heat exchanger by heating the compressor discharge air. Such preheating of the compressor discharge air decreases the heat input in the combustor and thereby increases the thermal efficiency.
