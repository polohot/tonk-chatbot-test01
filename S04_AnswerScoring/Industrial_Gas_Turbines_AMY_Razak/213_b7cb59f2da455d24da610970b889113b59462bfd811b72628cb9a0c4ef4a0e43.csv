# 12.2.6 Trends in temperature

Figure 12.12 shows the trends in temperature during the ambient pressure transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed results in an increase in the temperature ratios, T₂/T₁, T₃/T₁, and T₄ (EGT)/T₁. Since the ambient temperature, T₁, remains constant during this transient, an increase in all the other temperatures is observed during this ambient pressure transient. Note that the exhaust gas temperature, T₄, remains below its limiting value during this transient.

# 12.2.7 Trends in pressure

Although the compressor pressure ratio increases during the decrease in ambient pressure, the fall in ambient pressure is greater than the increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus the net result is a fall in compressor discharge pressure during the ambient pressure transient, as shown in Fig. 12.13, which illustrates the pressure trends during the ambient pressure transient. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure trend closely follows the compressor discharge pressure and shows a reduction in the gas generator turbine inlet pressure. Since the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine, a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure. The power turbine exit pressure, which is very similar to the compressor inlet pressure, decreases in line with the transient being simulated.

Note that the exhaust gas temperature, T₄, remains below its limiting value during this transient.

# 12.2.7 Trends in pressure

Although the compressor pressure ratio increases during the decrease in ambient pressure, the fall in ambient pressure is greater than the increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus the net result is a fall in compressor discharge pressure during the ambient pressure transient, as shown in Fig. 12.13, which illustrates the pressure trends during the ambient pressure transient. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure trend closely follows the compressor discharge pressure and shows a reduction in the gas generator turbine inlet pressure. Since the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine, a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure. The power turbine exit pressure, which is very similar to the compressor inlet pressure, decreases in line with the transient being simulated.

# 12.2.6 Trends in temperature

Figure 12.12 shows the trends in temperature during the ambient pressure transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed results in an increase in the temperature ratios, T₂/T₁, T₃/T₁, and T₄ (EGT)/T₁. Since the ambient temperature, T₁, remains constant during this transient, an increase in all the other temperatures is observed during this ambient pressure transient. Note that the exhaust gas temperature, T₄, remains below its limiting value during this transient.

# 12.2.7 Trends in pressure

Although the compressor pressure ratio increases during the decrease in ambient pressure, the fall in ambient pressure is greater than the increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus the net result is a fall in compressor discharge pressure during the ambient pressure transient, as shown in Fig. 12.13, which illustrates the pressure trends during the ambient pressure transient. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure trend closely follows the compressor discharge pressure and shows a reduction in the gas generator turbine inlet pressure. Since the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine, a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure. The power turbine exit pressure, which is very similar to the compressor inlet pressure, decreases in line with the transient being simulated.

# 12.2.6 Trends in temperature

Figure 12.12 shows the trends in temperature during the ambient pressure transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed results in an increase in the temperature ratios, T₂/T₁, T₃/T₁, and T₄ (EGT)/T₁. Since the ambient temperature, T₁, remains constant during this transient, an increase in all the other temperatures is observed during this ambient pressure transient. Note that the exhaust gas temperature, T₄, remains below its limiting value during this transient.

# 12.2.7 Trends in pressure

Although the compressor pressure ratio increases during the decrease in ambient pressure, the fall in ambient pressure is greater than the increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus the net result is a fall in compressor discharge pressure during the ambient pressure transient, as shown in Fig. 12.13, which illustrates the pressure trends during the ambient pressure transient. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure trend closely follows the compressor discharge pressure and shows a reduction in the gas generator turbine inlet pressure. Since the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine, a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure. The power turbine exit pressure, which is very similar to the compressor inlet pressure, decreases in line with the transient being simulated.

# 12.2.6 Trends in temperature

Figure 12.12 shows the trends in temperature during the ambient pressure transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed results in an increase in the temperature ratios, T₂/T₁, T₃/T₁, and T₄ (EGT)/T₁. Since the ambient temperature, T₁, remains constant during this transient, an increase in all the other temperatures is observed during this ambient pressure transient. Note that the exhaust gas temperature, T₄, remains below its limiting value during this transient.

# 12.2.7 Trends in pressure

Although the compressor pressure ratio increases during the decrease in ambient pressure, the fall in ambient pressure is greater than the increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus the net result is a fall in compressor discharge pressure during the ambient pressure transient, as shown in Fig. 12.13, which illustrates the pressure trends during the ambient pressure transient. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure trend closely follows the compressor discharge pressure and shows a reduction in the gas generator turbine inlet pressure. Since the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine, a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure. The power turbine exit pressure, which is very similar to the compressor inlet pressure, decreases in line with the transient being simulated.

# 12.2.6 Trends in temperature

Figure 12.12 shows the trends in temperature during the ambient pressure transient. The increase in compressor non-dimensional speed results in an increase in the temperature ratios, T₂/T₁, T₃/T₁, and T₄ (EGT)/T₁. Since the ambient temperature, T₁, remains constant during this transient, an increase in all the other temperatures is observed during this ambient pressure transient. Note that the exhaust gas temperature, T₄, remains below its limiting value during this transient.

# 12.2.7 Trends in pressure

Although the compressor pressure ratio increases during the decrease in ambient pressure, the fall in ambient pressure is greater than the increase in compressor pressure ratio. Thus the net result is a fall in compressor discharge pressure during the ambient pressure transient, as shown in Fig. 12.13, which illustrates the pressure trends during the ambient pressure transient. The gas generator turbine inlet pressure trend closely follows the compressor discharge pressure and shows a reduction in the gas generator turbine inlet pressure. Since the gas generator turbine pressure ratio remains essentially constant due to the choked conditions that prevail in the power turbine, a decrease in the compressor discharge pressure results in a decrease in the power turbine inlet pressure. The power turbine exit pressure, which is very similar to the compressor inlet pressure, decreases in line with the transient being simulated.
