also due to the increase in water vapour in the products of combustion, which is significant, as can be seen in Table 2.3. Also, note there is an increase in CO₂ content in the products of combustion, a greenhouse gas and thought to be responsible for global warming. Therefore, gas turbines operating with fuels such as natural gas or methane, which have a higher hydrogen content, will result in increased specific work due the high content of water vapour in the products of combustion.

Also, note there is an increase in CO₂ content in the products of combustion, a greenhouse gas and thought to be responsible for global warming. Therefore, gas turbines operating with fuels such as natural gas or methane, which have a higher hydrogen content, will result in increased specific work due the high content of water vapour in the products of combustion.

Also, note there is an increase in CO₂ content in the products of combustion, a greenhouse gas and thought to be responsible for global warming. Therefore, gas turbines operating with fuels such as natural gas or methane, which have a higher hydrogen content, will result in increased specific work due the high content of water vapour in the products of combustion.
