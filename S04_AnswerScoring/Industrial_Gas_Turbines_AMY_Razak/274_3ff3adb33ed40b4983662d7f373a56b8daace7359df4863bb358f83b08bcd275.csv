As a result, the fuel valve position also follows a similar trend to that shown in Figure 18.6.

Since the power output from the gas turbine remains constant in this case and the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases due to fouling, the fuel flow increases. As a result, the fuel valve position also follows a similar trend to that shown in Figure 18.6.
