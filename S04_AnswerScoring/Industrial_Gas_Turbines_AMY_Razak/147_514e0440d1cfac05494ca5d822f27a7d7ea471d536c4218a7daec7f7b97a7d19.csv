Single shaft gas turbines are often used in power generation and the gas turbine power output can be determined from the generator output. The total number of fault indices is four and they correspond to the compressor fouling and efficiency fault indices and to the turbine fouling and efficiency fault indices.

A similar approach can be used to determine the fault indices for other engine configurations discussed earlier. For a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine the required measurements are:

# Gas turbine performance deterioration

# Start

Initialise all fault indices to zero

Run the engine model at the operating conditions (i.e. run the model at the measured compressor inlet pressure and temperature, turbine exit pressure, power output and VIGV position)

|Does the measured EGT match the value from the model?|No|Yes|
|---|---|---|
|Adjust the turbine efficiency fault index| | |

|Does the compressor exit pressure match the model value?|No|Yes|
