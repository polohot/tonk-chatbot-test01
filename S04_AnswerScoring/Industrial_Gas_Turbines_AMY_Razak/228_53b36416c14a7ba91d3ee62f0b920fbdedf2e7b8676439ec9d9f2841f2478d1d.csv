However, the CO emissions have increased by a factor of 3.5. Also note that the increase in CO is the greatest at lower ambient temperatures. Thus the degree of NOx suppression by water injection may be limited at low ambient temperatures if the CO emissions exceed any alarm levels. The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

ω = 0.622 p                                             [14.5]

The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

# Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

ω = 0.622 p                                             [14.5]

14.18 Impact of water injection on CO2 production.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

ω = 0.622 p                                             [14.5]

As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed.

With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed.

As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

ω = 0.622 p                                             [14.5]

The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine.

Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

However, the CO emissions have increased by a factor of 3.5. Also note that the increase in CO is the greatest at lower ambient temperatures. Thus the degree of NOx suppression by water injection may be limited at low ambient temperatures if the CO emissions exceed any alarm levels. The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available.

Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

ω = 0.622 p                                             [14.5]

Thus the degree of NOx suppression by water injection may be limited at low ambient temperatures if the CO emissions exceed any alarm levels. The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

However, the CO emissions have increased by a factor of 3.5. Also note that the increase in CO is the greatest at lower ambient temperatures. Thus the degree of NOx suppression by water injection may be limited at low ambient temperatures if the CO emissions exceed any alarm levels. The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

Thus the degree of NOx suppression by water injection may be limited at low ambient temperatures if the CO emissions exceed any alarm levels. The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

However, the CO emissions have increased by a factor of 3.5. Also note that the increase in CO is the greatest at lower ambient temperatures. Thus the degree of NOx suppression by water injection may be limited at low ambient temperatures if the CO emissions exceed any alarm levels. The emissions of CO2 will also increase as a result of water injection and this effect is shown in Fig. 14.18. This is because of the loss in thermal efficiency and increased power output, which require increased fuel consumption.

# Power augmentation

If water injection is used for NO suppression, then the decrease in turbine creep life usage at low ambient temperatures should be considered when determining mean time between turbine overhauls. This should result in a useful reduction in maintenance costs of the turbine.

# 14.5 Turbine inlet cooling

The adverse effect that high ambient temperature has on power output and thermal efficiency has been observed. Means to improve gas turbine power output at high ambient temperatures using methods such as peak rating and water injection have also been discussed. However, they invariably have some disadvantages such as increased creep life usage and lower thermal efficiencies with direct water injection. As stated in Section 14.4, the turbine inlet can be cooled, thereby reducing the compressor inlet temperature to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. This is referred to as turbine inlet cooling or TIC. There are two main technologies available to reduce the compressor inlet temperature and they are known as evaporative (wetted media and inlet fogging) and chilling.

Wetted media cooling and fogging operate on the same principles, where the evaporation of water absorbs latent heat of evaporation, thus cooling the turbine inlet air. With wetted media, the media is saturated with water, is exposed to the compressor inlet air, and the resultant evaporation reduces the compressor inlet temperature thus increasing the gas turbine power output. Alternatively, the water can be introduced into the inlet as a very fine spray. The evaporation of the fine water droplets similarly cools the compressor inlet air and is known as fogging. The design issues regarding fogging systems are discussed by Meher-Homji and Mee.

Wetted media can operate on raw water; however, the mineral and salt content has to be controlled in order to prevent damage to the wetted media. Over time, the concentration of these minerals and salts will increase in the wetted media, resulting in blockage and damage to the wetted media. This reduces the effectiveness of the cooling media. With media cooling using raw water, a sufficient amount of water recirculation is necessary to prevent the concentration of minerals and salts in the evaporative media. Unlike wetted media evaporative cooling, which can operate with raw water, fogging systems require demineralised water. It should be noted that demineralised water is quite aggressive and will attack certain metals, and the inlet systems should use materials such as stainless steel or coatings that are resistant to attack from demineralised water.

The amount of water that can be evaporated depends on the relative humidity of the air. The lower the humidity, the more water can be evaporated and this results in a greater degree of turbine inlet temperature cooling. Another factor that limits the amount of cooling is the effectiveness of the

# 394 Industrial gas turbines – two-shaft cooling system

The more efficient the cooling, the closer the dry bulb temperature (which is effectively the ambient temperature) approaches the wet bulb temperature. For evaporative cooling systems using wetted media, the effectiveness can vary from 0.85 to 0.95, which is a measure of the difference between the final dry bulb and wet bulb temperature. There is an additional inlet loss due to the presence of the wetted media. This is considered small and can vary between 5 mm water gauge and 10 mm water gauge, depending on the effectiveness of the cooling media.

For a fogging system, the effectiveness can approach unity. In this case the dry bulb temperature approaches the wet bulb temperature and the compressor inlet air will be saturated. In fact, evaporative cooling occurs at a constant wet bulb temperature. Therefore, if the ambient wet bulb temperature is close to the dry bulb temperature (i.e. high relative humidity), only a little turbine inlet cooling is possible. There is no noticeable increase in inlet loss with fogging systems.

Another evaporative cooling technique is wet compression or overspray. Here, additional water is added as a fine spray directly into the inlet of the compressor. This water evaporates in the compressor due to the high temperatures that occur during adiabatic compression, thus cooling the air within the compressor. This is similar to isothermal compression, but to a lesser degree, and it reduces the compression power demand, therefore increasing the power output of the gas turbine. Hence this method of power augmentation is also referred to as fog intercooling. Since water is added directly into the compressor as a spray, there is an increased risk of compressor damage due to erosion, which can result in severe engine damage. It is argued that such damage is more than justified, considering the increased production. However, such compressor blade damage could easily result in surge, which can destroy the engine. In the event of such damage and reduced availability, any benefit from a wet compressor could easily be lost. As with a fogging system, demineralised water should be used for wet compression and should be applied in conjunction with evaporative cooling such as fogging.

Unlike evaporative cooling which is adiabatic, with inlet chilling heat is removed from the inlet air using some form of refrigeration. Thus inlet chillers are not limited by the wet bulb temperature, and the compressor inlet air can be cooled down to any desired temperature provided the cooling capacity is available. However, when the inlet temperature decreases below 10 degrees Celsius, there is an increased risk of ice formation in the inlet, which can break away and enter the engine, thereby damaging the engine. Thus turbine inlet cooling, whether evaporative or chilling is limited to compressor inlet temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius. Refrigeration systems for chillers can be either vapour compression or vapour absorption systems. The power demand from vapour compression systems is significant and is referred to as parasitic loss. In spite of such losses, there is still a

# Power augmentation

Useful gain in engine performance and so these have been employed to augment the power output at high ambient temperatures. Absorption refrigeration systems require a heat source, which can be provided from waste heat. Thus their parasitic losses are very small; however their performance is much poorer than vapour compression systems. If waste heat is readily available, the poor performance of vapour absorption refrigeration systems is of little consequence. Vapour compression systems can be part of a thermal storage system (TES) where low cost (off-peak electricity) is used to drive the chillers to produce ice or chilled water. During peak demand, the TES is used to provide the necessary turbine inlet cooling using ice or chilled water. Other sources for chilling include LNG evaporation systems where the turbine inlet air is used as a heat source for the evaporation of LNG.

# 14.5.1 Wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and cooling effectiveness

Wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure. It is therefore measured by wrapping a wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer and the measured temperature corresponds to the wet bulb temperature. The dry bulb temperature is the ambient temperature. The difference between these two temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower is the humidity. Given the wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and ambient pressure, the humidity of the air can be calculated as follows:

p = pw – 0.00066P(Ta – Tw)(1 + 0.00115Tw)                  [14.1]

where p is the vapour pressure of water vapour, pw is the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, P the ambient pressure, Ta is the ambient or dry bulb temperature, and Tw is the wet bulb temperature.

The saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the wet bulb temperature, pw is given by:

pw = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Tw / (T + 243.5))                                   [14.2]

Also the saturated vapour pressure of water vapour at the dry bulb temperature is:

ps = 6.112 × e(17.67 × Ta / (T + 243.5))                                    [14.3]

Using Equations 14.1 and 14.3, the relative humidity, φ, is calculated by:

φ = p / ps × 100                                              [14.4]

The specific humidity, ω, can also be determined and is given by:

ω = 0.622 p                                             [14.5]
