c = ⌈ P₂ ⌉ γγ–1 and T₄ is now the maximum cycle temperature.

Unlike the simple cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle is dependent on the cycle temperatures, particularly the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₄/T₁. The effect of the pressure ratio on the thermal efficiency is opposite to that for a simple cycle gas turbine. The thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle increases as the pressure ratio decreases and, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the thermal efficiency tends to that of the Carnot cycle efficiency, 1 – T₁/T₄.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# 2.8.1 Reversibility

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# 2.8.1 Reversibility

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

|Degraded energy during compression|P₂| |

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The compression work per unit flow rate will be:

Wcomp = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.26]

And the expansion work will be identical and therefore equal to:

Wexpansion = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.27]

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible. In practice, however, the actual compression and expansion processes, including losses, will be along the process line 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, respectively, as is also shown in Fig. ",How are actual compression and expansion processes different from ideal ones?,A5,"Real-world compression and expansion involve losses, making their paths (1–2, 2–3) differ from ideal reversible ones (1–2′, 2′–1).",1.4296875,1.578125,3.28125,1.296875,0.400390625

The equation defining the net specific work output is the same and is given by Equation 2.13:

where

c = ⌈ P₂ ⌉ γγ–1 and T₄ is now the maximum cycle temperature.

Unlike the simple cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle is dependent on the cycle temperatures, particularly the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₄/T₁. The effect of the pressure ratio on the thermal efficiency is opposite to that for a simple cycle gas turbine. The thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle increases as the pressure ratio decreases and, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the thermal efficiency tends to that of the Carnot cycle efficiency, 1 – T₁/T₄. This result is not entirely surprising because, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, all the

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

which reduces to

ηₜₕ = 1 – T₁ c [2.25]

where

c = ⌈ P₂ ⌉ γγ–1 and T₄ is now the maximum cycle temperature.

Unlike the simple cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle is dependent on the cycle temperatures, particularly the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₄/T₁. The effect of the pressure ratio on the thermal efficiency is opposite to that for a simple cycle gas turbine. The thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle increases as the pressure ratio decreases and, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the thermal efficiency tends to that of the Carnot cycle efficiency, 1 – T₁/T₄. This result is not entirely surprising because, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, all the

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# 2.8.1 Reversibility

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible. In practice, however, the actual compression and expansion processes, including losses, will be along the process line 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, respectively, as is also shown in Fig. ",How does the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle compare to the Carnot cycle efficiency?,A5,Efficiency of the regenerative cycle becomes similar to Carnot's 1 minus T₁ over T₄ at very low pressure ratios.,2.0,2.21875,3.4375,1.6171875,0.259765625

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

The compression work per unit flow rate will be:

Wcomp = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.26]

And the expansion work will be identical and therefore equal to:

Wexpansion = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.27]

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible. In practice, however, the actual compression and expansion processes, including losses, will be along the process line 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, respectively, as is also shown in Fig. ",How does the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle compare to the simple cycle?,A4,"Compared to the simple cycle, the regenerative cycle exhibits superior thermal efficiency at lower pressure ratios.",2.21875,2.453125,3.5,1.671875,0.228515625

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# 2.8.1 Reversibility

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible.

Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added.

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# 2.8.1 Reversibility

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

|Degraded energy during compression|P₂| |
|---|---|---|
|P₁|1|Degraded energy during expansion|
|2|2′| |
|3|3′|Increase in entropy during expansion|
|Increase in entropy during compression|Entropy| |

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The compression work per unit flow rate will be:

Wcomp = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.26]

And the expansion work will be identical and therefore equal to:

Wexpansion = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.27]

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible. In practice, however, the actual compression and expansion processes, including losses, will be along the process line 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, respectively, as is also shown in Fig. ",What is the concept of reversibility in thermodynamic processes?,A3,"The text defines reversibility in terms of ideal, no-loss compression and expansion cycles.",0.87109375,0.75390625,2.828125,1.125,0.2490234375

The heat input for the regenerative cycle is therefore given by:

The equation defining the net specific work output is the same and is given by Equation 2.13:

Unlike the simple cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle is dependent on the cycle temperatures, particularly the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₄/T₁.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added.

Unlike the simple cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle is dependent on the cycle temperatures, particularly the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₄/T₁. The effect of the pressure ratio on the thermal efficiency is opposite to that for a simple cycle gas turbine. The thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle increases as the pressure ratio decreases and, when the pressure ratio tends to unity, the thermal efficiency tends to that of the Carnot cycle efficiency, 1 – T₁/T₄.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

# 2.8.1 Reversibility

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

|Degraded energy during compression|P₂| |

And the expansion work will be identical and therefore equal to:

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible. In practice, however, the actual compression and expansion processes, including losses, will be along the process line 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, respectively, as is also shown in Fig. ",What is the effect of pressure ratio on the thermal efficiency of a regenerative cycle?,A3,"In the regenerative cycle, lower pressure ratios result in higher thermal efficiencies.",0.66796875,0.6171875,3.21875,0.9375,0.203125

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

The compression work per unit flow rate will be:

Wcomp = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.26]

And the expansion work will be identical and therefore equal to:

Wexpansion = cp (T2′ – T1) [2.27]

These compression and expansion processes are then said to be reversible. In practice, however, the actual compression and expansion processes, including losses, will be along the process line 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, respectively, as is also shown in Fig. ",What is the equation for the heat input in a regenerative cycle as described in the text?,A2,"In the regenerative cycle, the heat input is calculated using the formula Q₃₄ = cₚ(T₄ – T₃).",2.125,2.21875,3.703125,1.5,0.6953125

Unlike the simple cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerative cycle is dependent on the cycle temperatures, particularly the ratio of the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T₄/T₁.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

# 2.8 Reversibility and efficiency

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.

Using the temperature–entropy diagram shown in Figure 2.10, consider an ideal compression process where the pressure is increased from P₁ to P₂ along the process 1 to 2′ and is then followed by an ideal expansion from P₂ to P₁ along the process 2 ′ to 1.

Heat is supplied at the maximum temperature and all the heat rejected occurs at the minimum temperature. This is the Carnot requirement as discussed in Section 2.2. Although the work output tends to zero as the pressure ratio tends to unity and is of little practical importance, it is important to realise that the maximum thermal efficiency cannot exceed the Carnot efficiency, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.

The variation of thermal efficiency with pressure ratio for a regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.9. The thermal efficiency is shown for three different values of T₄. The Figure also shows the simple cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency for comparison. The limiting pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle occurs when the turbine exit temperature T₅ equals the compressor discharge temperature, T₂. The variation of the specific work for the ideal regenerative cycle is no different from that of the ideal simple cycle and will correspond to the curves shown in Fig. 2.6.

Further improvement in performance of the ideal simple cycle is possible by intercooling the compression process and reheating the working fluid as it passes through the compressor and turbine, respectively. Such modifications will improve the specific work output but will generally have a detrimental effect on the ideal cycle thermal efficiency unless a heat exchanger is added.

Until now we have discussed the thermodynamic cycles of the gas turbine assuming that there are no thermodynamic losses in any of the components. In practice, however, this is not the case and the individual processes of compression, expansion and heat addition will each have losses. It has been stated that, in any thermodynamic process, the energy is degraded thus making the energy unavailable when increasing the entropy. This feature gives rise to the concept of efficiency in a thermodynamic process such as compression and expansion.
