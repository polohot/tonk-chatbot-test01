# 3.1.4 Ideal intercooled and regenerative gas turbine cycle

The thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled cycle may be increased by the addition of a heat exchanger to recover the exhaust heat and transfer it to the compressor discharge air before combustion. A schematic representation of such a cycle, known as the intercooled regenerative cycle, is shown in Fig. 3.10. It is very similar to the regenerative cycle discussed in Section 2.7 but differs due to the addition of an intercooled compressor.

In the case of the ideal cycle, the compressor discharge air at station 4 is heated by the exhaust gas such that the temperature of the compressor discharge air rises to the turbine exhaust temperature, T₇, at station 5. The temperature of the heated air leaving the heat exchanger is then increased to the maximum cycle temperature by burning fuel in the combustor. The work done by the turbine, which drops the turbine exhaust temperature to T₇, drives both the

Optimising the LP compressor pressure ratio to maximise the specific work results in a lower thermal efficiency as is illustrated in Fig. 3.9. In this

# Complex gas turbine cycle

In case the LP pressure ratio is approximately equal to the square root of the overall compressor pressure ratio. It has been assumed that the LP and HP compressor polytropic efficiencies are equal. It is when different values of polytropic efficiencies for respective compressors are considered that the optimised pressure ratio for maximum specific work departs from the square root relationship. The compressor pressure ratio split will be biased towards the higher efficiency compressor.

# 3.1.4 Ideal intercooled and regenerative gas turbine cycle

The thermal efficiency of the ideal intercooled cycle may be increased by the addition of a heat exchanger to recover the exhaust heat and transfer it to the compressor discharge air before combustion. A schematic representation of such a cycle, known as the intercooled regenerative cycle, is shown in Fig. 3.10. It is very similar to the regenerative cycle discussed in Section 2.7 but differs due to the addition of an intercooled compressor.

In the case of the ideal cycle, the compressor discharge air at station 4 is heated by the exhaust gas such that the temperature of the compressor discharge air rises to the turbine exhaust temperature, T₇, at station 5. The temperature of the heated air leaving the heat exchanger is then increased to the maximum cycle temperature by burning fuel in the combustor. The work done by the turbine, which drops the turbine exhaust temperature to T₇, drives both the
