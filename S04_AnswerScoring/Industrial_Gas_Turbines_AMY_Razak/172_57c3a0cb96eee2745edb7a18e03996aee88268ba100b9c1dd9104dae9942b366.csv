From the law of conservation of mass (continuity), the change in mass, M, trapped within the element is determined by the difference in amount of mass (of fluid) entering and leaving the element. Therefore, the rate of change in the mass trapped within the element is determined by the difference in the fluid flow rate at the inlet and exit of the element, W1 and W2, respectively.

The density of the fluid within the element in differential form is given by:

ρ = dM / dV [10.8]

where ρ is the static density at some midpoint within the element and V is the volume of the element.

Substituting Equation 10.8 into Equation 10.7:

Note: It has been assumed that the gas or fluid is perfect and this is usually the case for air and products of combustion at pressures and temperatures present in gas turbines.
