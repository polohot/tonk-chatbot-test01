Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

# 16.2.6 Speed and VIGV position trends

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

# 16.2.6 Speed and VIGV position trends

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

# 16.2.6 Speed and VIGV position trends

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced.

This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption.

As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.

Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

# 16.2.6 Speed and VIGV position trends

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

Also, the specific humidity of the ambient air decreases as the ambient temperature decreases, as seen in Fig. 11.15. The change in these parameters with ambient temperature results in an increase in NOx as discussed in Section 6.8. However, an increase in these parameters also results in a decrease in CO (Section 6.8). Thus it is observed that NOx increases while CO decreases when operating on the EGT limit.

When the engine is constrained to operate on the power limit, it is observed that the combustion temperature falls. Although the compressor discharge pressure and the combustion pressure continue to increase, they do so at a decreased rate. The fall in combustion temperature is greater and a decrease in NOx is observed, although the fall is not as great as the rise in NOx during constant EGT operation because of the continuous rise in the combustion pressure. These factors also give rise to an increase in CO when the engine is constrained to operate at constant power.

The trend in CO2 emissions is also shown in Fig. 16.12. The mass flow rate of CO2 is observed to increase during constant EGT operation and this is due to the increase in fuel flow during this period of operation. During constant power operation the fuel flow falls, thus a decrease in CO flow rate is observed. The figure also shows the CO2 emissions as an emissions index, kg/MW h, and represents the emission of CO2 on a mass basis per unit of power produced. Note that the emissions index falls continuously during this transient. This index is similar to the specific fuel consumption and, for a given fuel, it is proportional to the specific fuel consumption. Since the specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the thermal efficiency, the continuous increase in thermal efficiency results in a continuous decrease in the CO2 emissions index. Thus less CO2 is generated at constant power if the ambient temperature falls. Figure 16.13 shows the NOx and CO emissions on an ambient temperature basis while Fig. 16.14 shows the CO2 emissions index on an ambient temperature basis. It must be noted that the NOx and CO emissions are predicted using Bakken’s and Rick and Mongia’s correlation as discussed in Sections 6.18.1 and 6.18.2, respectively.

# 16.2.6 Speed and VIGV position trends

The gas turbine speed remains constant and the speed is determined by the generator, depending on the required frequency. As the ambient temperature falls during this transient, the compressor non-dimensional speed, N1/√T1, increases. This is observed in Fig. 16.15, which shows the trends in compressor non-dimensional speed and the trend in the VIGV position during this transient.

16.14 CO₂ emissions index on an ambient temperature basis.

The figure also shows the trend in the turbine non-dimensional speed, N /√T. It is observed that the turbine entry temperature, T₃ increases during the period when the EGT limits the power output and then decreases during the period when the power output from the gas turbine is limited (Fig. 16.8). Thus it is observed that the turbine non-dimensional speed decreases during the period when the engine power output is limited during constant EGT.
