A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

The calculation of the error is as follows. Referring to Fig. 10.8, the error based on the acceleration line (erra) is defined as:

erra =  Pra – Pro100

Pra × [10.5]

and the error based on the deceleration line (errd) is defined as:

where Pra is the compressor pressure ratio limit during acceleration for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, Prd is the compressor pressure ratio limit during deceleration for a given non-dimensional speed and Pro is the operating compressor pressure ratio.

Alternatively, non-dimensional fuel flow may be used instead of compressor pressure ratio in setting the accel–decel line.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

Turbines enable such limit lines to be implemented on the basis of the compressor pressure ratio and compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Fig. 10.7. If the transient running lines are contained within such acceleration and deceleration limit lines, as shown in Fig. 10.7, this will ensure satisfactory transient performance from the gas turbine. Therefore, the acceleration limit line, often referred to as the accel line, is provided to prevent compressor surge, excessive high turbine entry temperatures and flameout due to too rich a fuel–air mixture during engine acceleration. Similarly, the deceleration limit line, often referred to as the decel line, is provided to prevent flameout conditions due to too lean a fuel–air ratio. In practice, manufacturers may use the compressor discharge pressure or fuel flow, with varying gas generator speed to implement the accel and decel limit lines.

The implementation of signal selection to protect the engine during steady-state operation and therefore prevent the engine from overheating and overspeeding has been discussed. The implementation of the acceleration and deceleration limit lines also uses signal selection. The error required by the control system for signal selection is calculated using the accel and decel lines as set points. This error is compared with the errors calculated using the gas generator speed, EGT, aerodynamic speed and power turbine speed limits as set points, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thus, a low signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain below the acceleration limit line and a high signal selection will ensure that the operating point will remain above the deceleration limit line during engine transients.

A continuous increase in power demand can be satisfied by a continuous increase in fuel flow. This could, of course, result in the engine over-speeding and overheating. Signal selection can be used to protect the engine by preventing such engine limits from being exceeded. With signal selection, further errors are calculated using the engine operating limits as the set point and comparing them with the current values.

Figure 10.4 shows an engine control system with signal selection. The four engine limits discussed above are shown (aerodynamic speed limit, gas generator speed limit, EGT limit and the power turbine speed limit). The lowest error is used as the input to the control system and is often referred to as low signal select. Similarly, when the control system uses the highest error for control purposes, the signal selection is referred to as high signal select. High signal selection is used to prevent the gas generator and the power turbine speeds from reaching critical speeds, which occur at between 50% and 70% of the design speed, where high vibrations can occur resulting in engine damage.

# 10.3 Acceleration–deceleration lines

It has been stated that a change in the power output from the gas turbine is achieved by varying the fuel flow. During transients, such as acceleration and deceleration, the operating points will shift or leave the steady-state running line, as shown in Fig. 10.5. If the change in fuel flow is very rapid, surge problems may be encountered during acceleration; and engine flameout during deceleration due to the fuel–air ratio being too weak. Flameout conditions may also be encountered during acceleration resulting from the fuel–air ratios becoming too rich and this situation may result in high turbine temperatures, thus compromising the turbine creep life.

It is therefore necessary to restrict the fuel flow rate during such transients, thereby preventing conditions that would lead to trips due to flameout and engine damage due to overheating and compressor surge. This is achieved by imposing limit lines on the compressor characteristic, thus preventing operating points from crossing these lines and hence avoiding conditions that would lead to the flameout and surge conditions discussed above. Figure 10.6 shows these lines on the compressor characteristic as acceleration and deceleration limit lines. The expected transient running lines during acceleration and deceleration are also shown in the Figure. Note that the transient running lines remain within these limit lines and therefore trips due to flameout conditions and compressor problems do not occur.

The implementation of such limit lines is impractical within engine control.
