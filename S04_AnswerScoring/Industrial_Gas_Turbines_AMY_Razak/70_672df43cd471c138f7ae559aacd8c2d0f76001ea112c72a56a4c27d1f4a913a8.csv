# 4.10.3 Variable geometry compressors

An alternative to using multi-spooled compressors to improve the off-design performance of axial compressors operating at high pressure ratios is to use several variable stators at the front of the compressor. Closing these variable stators at low compressor speeds reduces the stage loading on these stages.

Closing these variable stators at low compressor speeds reduces the stage loading on these stages.

Figure 4.24 shows the effect of the closure of the stator on the velocity triangles (dotted lines). We observe how the rotor deflection (₁ – 2) and the reduced deflection due to closure of stators.

# 4.10.3 Variable geometry compressors

An alternative to using multi-spooled compressors to improve the off-design performance of axial compressors operating at high pressure ratios is to use several variable stators at the front of the compressor. Closing these variable stators at low compressor speeds reduces the stage loading on these stages.

Figure 4.24 shows the effect of the closure of the stator on the velocity triangles (dotted lines). We observe how the rotor deflection (₁ – 2) and the reduced deflection due to closure of stators.
