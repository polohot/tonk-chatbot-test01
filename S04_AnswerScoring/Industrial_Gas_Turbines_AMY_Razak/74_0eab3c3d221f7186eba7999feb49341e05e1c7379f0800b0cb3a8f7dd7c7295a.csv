5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

|ΔVW|α1|β2| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|β1|Ca|V₁|C₁|V₂|C₂|Ca|α2|

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

|ΔVW|α1|β2| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|β1|Ca|V₁|C₁|V₂|C₂|Ca|α2|

ΔH/U2 and Ca/U are called the stage loading and flow coefficients, respectively. It is worth noting that the stage loading coefficient is also given by ΔVw/U.

Smith4 generated a correlation relating turbine efficiency with the stage loading and flow coefficients and this is often referred to as the Smith plot. This is shown in Fig. ",How does the pressure gradient in turbines compare to that in compressors?,A1,"Turbines have a favourable pressure gradient with decreasing pressure, unlike compressors, leading to less boundary layer growth.",2.328125,2.5,3.46875,1.59375,0.3359375

The amount of expansion in the stator and rotor is controlled by the design of the turbine and is called the reaction of the stage.

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

The amount of expansion in the stator and rotor is controlled by the design of the turbine and is called the reaction of the stage.

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

|ΔVW|α1|β2| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

# 5.2 Stage load and flow coefficient

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage.

The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

From the steady flow energy equation (Q – W = ΔH), where ΔH is the enthalpy change, for an adiabatic process we can rewrite Equation 5.8 as:

ΔH = UCa(tan(β₁ + tan(β₂)) [5.9]

And dividing by U²:

ΔH = Ca (tan (β₁) + tan (β₂ )) [5.10]

|ΔVW|α1|β2| | | | | |

# Axial turbines

ΔH/U2 and Ca/U are called the stage loading and flow coefficients, respectively. It is worth noting that the stage loading coefficient is also given by ΔVw/U.

Smith4 generated a correlation relating turbine efficiency with the stage loading and flow coefficients and this is often referred to as the Smith plot. This is shown in Fig. ",Why is there no question of turbines surging as mentioned in the text?,A2,"The favourable pressure gradient in turbines, where pressure decreases through stages, prevents surging.",2.4375,2.53125,3.609375,1.328125,0.37109375

The amount of expansion in the stator and rotor is controlled by the design of the turbine and is called the reaction of the stage. When all the expansion takes place in the rotor, the reaction is said to be 100% and when all the expansion takes place in the stator, the reaction is 0% (impulse stage).

The pressure decreases through the stages and this condition is referred to as a favourable pressure gradient. As a result, there is no question of turbines surging, and the amount of work extracted from a turbine stage can be considerably larger than that absorbed by a stage of a compressor. Consequently, a single turbine stage can drive many compressor stages as is often observed in practice.

5.1 Axial turbine with two stages.

# Axial turbines

# 5.2 Turbine stage.

Profile for a single turbine stage. The gas enters the stator, also known as the nozzle or nozzle guide vane (NGV), and is deflected through a suitable angle to the rotor to minimise losses (Denton, 1993). The gas may expand as it passes through the stator and the rotor, and the amount of expansion is determined by the reaction of the stage.

Figure 5.2 also shows the velocity triangles at inlet and exit from the rotor. The rotor produces all the work done from the turbine stage. Therefore, the power output by a turbine stage is the torque multiplied by the blade velocity. The torque is produced by a change in the swirl or tangential velocity.

The swirl or tangential velocity into the rotor,  Cw₁, is given by:

Cw₁ = Ca tan(α₁)                                                 [5.1]

and the swirl or tangential velocity at exit from the rotor,  Cw₂, is given by:

Cw₂ = Ca tan(α₂)                                                 [5.2]

Thus, the change in swirl velocity  ΔVw is given by:

ΔVw = Cw₁ – (–Cw₂) = Cw₁ + Cw₂                                    [5.3]

because Cw₂ acts in the opposite direction to  Cw₁.

The work done per unit mass flow rate,  W, is given by:

W = ΔVwU                                                         [5.4]

where U is the blade velocity.

# Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔVw = Ca(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.5]

Therefore:

W = UCa(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) [5.6]

where Ca is the axial velocity.

It is more useful to represent Equation 5.6 in terms of rotor angles. Using the relationship:

U = Ca(tan(α₁) – tan(β₁)) = Ca(tan(β₂) – tan(α₂)) [5.7]

W = UCa(tan(β₁) + tan(β₂)) [5.8]

where β₁ + β₂ is the rotor deflection.

Unlike compressors, with turbines the pressure decreases and, as a result, the boundary layer growth is much smaller in turbines compared with compressors. Consequently, the work done factor to account for the boundary layer growth is unnecessary and therefore the work done factor λ can be set to unity.

The flow area can be increased along the turbine to account for the reducing density in such a manner that the axial velocity, Ca, is constant. The inlet and exit velocity triangles can therefore be superimposed on a common base, U, which corresponds to the velocity diagram shown in Fig. 5.3.

where U is the blade velocity.
