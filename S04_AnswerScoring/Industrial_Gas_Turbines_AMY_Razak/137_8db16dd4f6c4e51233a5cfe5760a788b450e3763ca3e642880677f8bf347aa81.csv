Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

# 8.29 Change in the operating points on the LP and HP compressor characteristics due to reheating a three-shaft gas turbine incorporating a free power turbine.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency.

The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

8.32 Variation of power turbine output with power turbine speed for a series of ambient temperatures.

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators.

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

# 8.29 Change in the operating points on the LP and HP compressor characteristics due to reheating a three-shaft gas turbine incorporating a free power turbine.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

# 8.29 Change in the operating points on the LP and HP compressor characteristics due to reheating a three-shaft gas turbine incorporating a free power turbine.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio.

With aero-derived gas turbines, one manufacturer may build the gas generator while another, normally a package provider, will provide the power turbine. Providing the power turbine swallowing capacity matches that specified by the gas generator manufacturer, the performance of the gas generator should not be compromised. Having selected a gas generator, the user may consider various power turbines by comparing their performance as shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32. The variations of thermal efficiency with power turbine speed can also be illustrated and will be similar in shape to the curves shown in Figures 8.31 and 8.32.

# 8.9 Gas power and gas thermal efficiency

Means of comparing the performance of power turbines have been discussed. The performance of gas generators may be compared by comparing the gas powers generated. The gas power is calculated by assuming that the expansion through the power turbine is isentropic (i.e. that the power turbine efficiency is 100%). The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during

# 8.10 Heat rate and specific fuel consumption

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine has been defined as the work done per unit input of heat. However, operators on occasions require the amount of heat per unit of work done and this is referred to as the heat rate of the engine. Thus, the heat rate is simply the reciprocal or the inverse of the thermal efficiency and is usually quoted in kJ of heat per kW hour. Thus the heat rate (HR) is given by:

HR = 3600
[8.15]
ηth

where ηth is the thermal efficiency.

An alternative means to determine the heat input per unit of work done is to express the heat input in terms of fuel consumption. This is referred to as the specific fuel consumption or SFC. It is usually quoted as kg of fuel per kW hour and is given by:

SFC = ηth × 3600
[8.16]
Qnet

where Qnet is the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel.

It is evident from Equations 8.15 and 8.16 that the heat rate and specific fuel consumption are related via the LHV of the fuel. Thus the heat rate can be expressed as:

HR = SFC × Qnet

Although there will be a reduction in the HP turbine pressure ratio, and thus the work produced by the HP turbine, the two turbines are linked mechanically and therefore transfer of power from the LP to the HP turbine can occur. Hence, the compressor operating point and the turbine entry temperature can remain at the design value without the use of any variable geometry in the turbine.

In fact, power transfer has been applied to two-shaft gas turbines operating with a free power turbine, where controlled amounts of power are transferred from the GG turbine to the power turbine by the use of clutches (Turunen and Collman, 1965). Such techniques have been applied to regenerative automotive gas turbines to improve the part-load thermal efficiency.

In naval applications, it is possible to consider a separate variable pitch propeller and shaft connected to the GG turbine. Thus it is possible to transfer power from the GG shaft such that the maximum turbine entry temperature is maintained at part-load operation. The incorporation of a heat exchanger and power transfer then can result in significant increase in off-design thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 8.7 Running line, non-dimensional parameters and correcting data to standard conditions

The previous analysis on gas turbines using a free power turbine (without reheat) essentially describes a unique running line on the compressor and turbine characteristics. Therefore, for any given parameter, such as the compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique value for other parameters such as the compressor pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and non-dimensional mass flow. If these parameters are now plotted against compressor non-dimensional speed, we should obtain a unique line. The reason why these unique lines are obtained is because gas turbines behave non-dimensionally.

Figure 8.30 shows such an example for the compressor inlet non-dimensional flow varying with compressor non-dimensional speed. Similar figures can be drawn for other parameters for each engine component such as compressors and turbines. Power and fuel flow can also be written in non-dimensional terms and these terms may be derived from the non-dimensional steady flow energy equation. The non-dimensional terms for power and fuel flow are Power/(P₁√T₁) and Fuel flow/(P√T₁), respectively.

# 8.7.1 Correction of data to standard conditions

Gas turbine performance is very sensitive to ambient conditions. Operators often require the engine performance at some standard atmospheric conditions.

so that the performance of different engines may be compared. Standard conditions normally refer to 1 standard atmosphere, usually 1.013 Bar, and 288.15 K or 15 degrees Celsius (also referred to as ISO conditions). However, for gas turbines operating in tropical environments, we have to correct the engine performance to an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. In Nordic countries, the average ambient temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius to give a more meaningful performance of the gas turbine.

The correction of data to these standard conditions is achieved by equating the respective non-dimensional parameters at the two different operating conditions. For example, when correcting power to standard conditions the non-dimensional power at the actual condition is equated to that of the standard condition as follows.

Pow = PowCor

P₁ T₁ = P Cor T Cor

1 1 1 1

thus

PowCor = Pow × P Cor

P₁ T₁ 1 T₁

where Pow, T and P₁ correspond to the actual power and ambient conditions and PowCor, T₁Cor and P₁Cor correspond to the standard ambient conditions. Similarly, we can correct fuel flow, airflow, speeds and other engine parameters such as pressures and temperatures to standard conditions by equating their respective non-dimensional parameters.

In fact, the corrected value for power may be determined directly using corrected parameters and corresponds to

PowCor = P δ θ

1 T

where δ = P₁ and θ = T₁.

Similarly, corrected compressor flow, W₁Cor and speed, N₁Cor are determined by:

W₁Cor = δ θ

N₁Cor = δ θ

respectively. More information on non-dimensional groups may be found in Walsh and Fletcher.⁶

# 8.8 Power turbine curves

Power turbines are used to drive various loads. In power generation applications the power turbine (and generator) will run at a synchronous (mechanical) speed independent of the power output, whereas in mechanical drive

# 238 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

applications, the power turbine runs at different speeds depending on the load, which is determined by the process conditions. However, the performance of the power turbine is not entirely determined by the mechanical speed but also by its non-dimensional speed, which is dependent on the power turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Thus, the non-dimensional speed will vary with load even in power generation applications where the mechanical speed of the power turbine remains constant. However, operators often require such data in terms of mechanical speed rather than in terms of non-dimensional speed because it is easier to relate such data to their process conditions.

This is achieved by plotting the power turbine power output with speed for a series of gas generator speeds, as illustrated in Fig. 8.31. This shows the variation of power output with power turbine speed for a range of gas generator speeds and is normally drawn for ISO conditions. For a three-shaft engine operating with a free power turbine, the curves is drawn for a series of LP spool speeds.

For a given gas generator speed, there is a region where the power output increases with power turbine speed. This increase is primarily due to an increase in power turbine efficiency. Often, operators are concerned with the maximum power available from the gas turbine at various ambient temperatures. The above figure can be represented in terms of ambient temperature. Lines of constant gas generator speeds are shown in Fig. 8.31 and can be replaced by lines of constant ambient temperatures while maintaining the mechanical speed of the gas generator at 100%. It should be noted that each constant temperature line also corresponds to a particular compressor non-dimensional.

The thermal efficiency of the gas generator is referred to as the gas thermal efficiency and is calculated from the gas power, thus enabling comparison of the performance of different gas generators. The comparison of gas generator performance may be carried out at various ambient temperatures and pressures, which the user is more likely to encounter during
