As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall.

This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",How is the overall pressure ratio for a multi-stage compressor calculated?,A5,"For a multi-stage compressor, the overall pressure ratio is obtained by calculating the stage pressure ratio for each stage in sequence, using the outlet temperature of one stage as the inlet temperature for the next.",1.8046875,2.078125,3.28125,1.8203125,0.63671875

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",How is the stage temperature rise determined in a compressor?,A5,"Determining the stage temperature rise requires the stage stagnation enthalpy rise divided by the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, yielding ΔT = ΔH/cₚ.",1.6875,1.765625,3.171875,1.8046875,0.60546875

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What are the effects of increasing stage inlet temperature on stage pressure ratio in high-pressure stages of a compressor?,A5,Elevated stage inlet temperatures in the later stages of a compressor result in a lower stage pressure ratio.,1.8046875,1.828125,3.359375,1.5625,0.216796875

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall.

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases.

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature.

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What is rotating stall and how does it affect compressor performance?,A4,"An instability leading to blade stall and flow separation, resulting in higher losses, efficiency decline, and surge potential.",1.515625,1.6953125,3.171875,1.2109375,0.306640625

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What non-dimensional groups are used to represent the overall compressor characteristic?,A3,"Non-dimensional flow, speed, pressure ratio, and isentropic efficiency are the key groups for depicting compressor characteristics.",2.21875,2.328125,3.5625,1.65625,0.45703125

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.

# 4.5.1 Worked example

Stage-loading coefficient = 0.5

Blade velocity U = 250 m/s

Stage inlet temperature T₁ = 288 K

Stage isentropic efficiency ηₛ = 0.9

cₚ = 1.005 kJ/kg K

γ = 1.4

ΔH = 0.5(250)²/1000 = 31.25 kJ/kg

ΔT/T₁ = 31.25/288 = 0.1085

From Equation 4.7:

Rs = [1 + 0.87 × 0.1085]1.4/(1.4–1) = 1.37125

The stage outlet temperature will be:

T₂ = ΔT + T₁ = 31.25 + 288 = 319.25 K

If the compressor consists of 16 such stages, all having the same stage-loading coefficient and blade velocity at blade mid-height, the temperature rise per stage will be 31.25 K. However, the stage inlet temperature will increase progressively as we move along the compressor towards the higher-pressure stages. Therefore, stage pressure ratio will decrease at the high-pressure stages due to the increase in the stage inlet temperature. By an analysis similar to that discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.8.3), we can calculate the overall pressure ratio for all the 16 stages by repeating the above calculation but using the stage inlet temperature as the outlet temperature of the previous stage. When this is done, we get an overall pressure ratio for our compressor of about 21.

# 4.6 Overall compressor characteristics

Evaluating the engine performance using the compressor stage characteristics is rather cumbersome. A more useful means is to generate the overall compressor characteristic representing the effects of all the stages. This can be achieved by using the stage characteristics in conjunction with techniques such as stage stacking to generate the overall compressor characteristic.

The overall characteristic is normally represented using non-dimensional groups. The groups used are non-dimensional flow, non-dimensional speed, pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency. The definitions of these groups are as follows:

- non-dimensional flow W₁√T₁/P₁
- non-dimensional speed N₁/√T₁
- pressure ratio P₂/P₁
- isentropic efficiency η₁₂.

The station numbers 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and discharge of the compressor respectively. The non-dimensional flow and speed are in fact Mach numbers, based on the inlet flow rate and rotational speed, respectively. A typical overall compressor characteristic is shown in Fig. 4.14.

A feature of a compressor characteristic is that constant speed lines become vertical and bunch together as the speed increases. This is due to the compressor inlet stages choking. The figure also shows the contours of constant isentropic efficiency and the surge line on the compressor characteristic.

# 4.7 Rotating stall

Another form of instability that gives rise to a loss in compressor efficiency and can lead into surge is termed rotating stall. As the incidence of the flow entering the blade increases, the flow passing over the blade will separate and stall, resulting in increased losses as shown in Fig. ",What occurs when stall starts in a compressor blade?,A3,"Stall initiation leads to a swift rise in deviation and a drop in deflection, disrupting the flow along the blade profile.",1.875,2.078125,3.296875,1.3359375,0.423828125

As the incidence increases, the deflection, and thus the stage pressure ratio, increases. However, when stall starts, the deflection falls as the deviation increases rapidly because the flow cannot follow the blade profile. The start of stall also results in a rapid increase in profile loss, as shown in Fig. 4.11.
