# 7.4 Matrix method of solution

Clearly, the off-design analysis is tedious and a computer program is usually developed to determine the off-design performance of a gas turbine. Methods employed by computer programs often use matrix manipulations using the estimates and checks described above to solve a set of non-linear equations.

In matrix notation, the solution of a set of equations is given by:

J.dx = –F                                                     [7.25]

where J is a matrix that represents the rates of change of the variables used in the calculation of the checks above, such as non-dimensional flows and power balance with respect to the estimated variables such as compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature, as discussed in Sections 7.2 and 7.3.

# 186 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

dx is a column matrix or a vector containing step changes in the estimated values used to calculate the rates of change in the matrix J.

F is a vector containing the function values (check values described in Section 7.2 and 7.3) and will represent the errors since we are solving these equations for the case F = 0.

Solving Equation 7.25 will determine the vector dx.
