W₃√T₃/P₃ will be fixed by the choking of the gas generator turbine as discussed. For a constant combustor pressure loss, P₂/P₃ will be constant. Although it is possible to find more than one solution for P₂/P₁ and W₁√T₁/P₁ from Equation 8.5, in practice, the shape of the compressor characteristic does not show a significant change in flow with pressure ratio, particularly at high speed, where W₁√T₁/P₁ is approximately constant. Thus only a single solution is possible.

At different compressor non-dimensional speeds, different values for ΔT₂₁/T₁ would apply, resulting in different values for T₃/T₁ (Equation 8.4), hence giving unique operating points on each compressor speed line. Joining these points gives the (unique) running line on the compressor characteristic for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. If gas property changes are considered, then the running line will change with ambient conditions but this is usually small, particularly at low ambient temperatures. For rigorous analysis, gas property changes need to be allowed for as discussed in Chapter 7. The compressor characteristic with the running line superimposed on it is shown in Fig. 8.7. This line differs from the case of a single-shaft gas turbine, where a series of running lines occurs, each of constant power output as shown in Fig. 8.4.

Joining these points gives the (unique) running line on the compressor characteristic for a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. If gas property changes are considered, then the running line will change with ambient conditions but this is usually small, particularly at low ambient temperatures. For rigorous analysis, gas property changes need to be allowed for as discussed in Chapter 7. The compressor characteristic with the running line superimposed on it is shown in Fig. 8.7. This line differs from the case of a single-shaft gas turbine, where a series of running lines occurs, each of constant power output as shown in Fig. 8.4.

W₃√T₃/P₃ will be fixed by the choking of the gas generator turbine as discussed. For a constant combustor pressure loss, P₂/P₃ will be constant. Although it is possible to find more than one solution for P₂/P₁ and W₁√T₁/P₁ from Equation 8.5, in practice, the shape of the compressor characteristic does not show a significant change in flow with pressure ratio, particularly at high speed, where W₁√T₁/P₁ is approximately constant. Thus only a single solution is possible.

At different compressor non-dimensional speeds, different values for ΔT₂₁/T₁ would apply, resulting in different values for T₃/T₁ (Equation 8.4), hence giving unique operating points on each compressor speed line.
