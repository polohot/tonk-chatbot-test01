# Foreword

The book includes numerous simulation exercises. These exercises are not restrictively academic but include much of the author’s experience, gained from an operator’s viewpoint. Unlike numerical exercises, which give a somewhat narrow understanding of the problem, simulation exercises provide a holistic view of performance, which students, manufacturers and operators will find invaluable.

# Preface

The use of industrial gas turbines is widespread in many industries that require power. The power is used to generate electricity or drive equipment such as pumps and process compressors. ","What industries commonly use industrial gas turbines, as mentioned in the preface?",A5,Common applications include electricity generation and the operation of mechanical devices such as pumps and compressors in various industries.,2.375,2.453125,3.546875,1.1015625,0.5625

The optimisation process involves many uncertainties and a proper understanding of these, together with the established facts and the method of handling this information, is required to permit manufacturers to develop their engines successfully and allow operators to operate the machines to their best advantage. This is particularly true in the de-regulated market in which many operate today and which others will be joining in the near future.

Although there are many very remarkable books on industrial gas turbine performance and engineering, this book offers something different through a combined approach to the theory of gas turbines, their performance, and the use of gas turbine simulators. Simulators form an analysis method which can be used to bring together the many disciplines involved and which provides a way of assessing the impact of uncertainties. The combination of the book with the example simulators provides an added dimension to the product and this seems to conform to what many educational and training experts in this field have been demanding for some time. The book/simulator combination provides a useful reference text for students and practising engineers in both gas turbine manufacturing and operations.

The book initially covers the theory of gas turbine performance from a design and off-design point of view, including transient analysis, and gives much detail on these two very important aspects of engine performance. The latter part of the book revisits the earlier chapters, using the simulators to highlight in detail the issues facing industrial gas turbines in the real world. The simulators are effectively virtual engines with respect to performance, deterioration, emissions, control, and life usage. There is also a useful life cycle calculation module. This provides a clear view of the operability of the gas turbine under different conditions.

# Foreword

The book includes numerous simulation exercises. These exercises are not restrictively academic but include much of the author’s experience, gained from an operator’s viewpoint. Unlike numerical exercises, which give a somewhat narrow understanding of the problem, simulation exercises provide a holistic view of performance, which students, manufacturers and operators will find invaluable.

The optimisation process involves many uncertainties and a proper understanding of these, together with the established facts and the method of handling this information, is required to permit manufacturers to develop their engines successfully and allow operators to operate the machines to their best advantage. This is particularly true in the de-regulated market in which many operate today and which others will be joining in the near future.

Although there are many very remarkable books on industrial gas turbine performance and engineering, this book offers something different through a combined approach to the theory of gas turbines, their performance, and the use of gas turbine simulators. Simulators form an analysis method which can be used to bring together the many disciplines involved and which provides a way of assessing the impact of uncertainties. The combination of the book with the example simulators provides an added dimension to the product and this seems to conform to what many educational and training experts in this field have been demanding for some time. The book/simulator combination provides a useful reference text for students and practising engineers in both gas turbine manufacturing and operations.

The book initially covers the theory of gas turbine performance from a design and off-design point of view, including transient analysis, and gives much detail on these two very important aspects of engine performance. The latter part of the book revisits the earlier chapters, using the simulators to highlight in detail the issues facing industrial gas turbines in the real world. The simulators are effectively virtual engines with respect to performance, deterioration, emissions, control, and life usage. There is also a useful life cycle calculation module. This provides a clear view of the operability of the gas turbine under different conditions.

# Foreword

The book includes numerous simulation exercises. These exercises are not restrictively academic but include much of the author’s experience, gained from an operator’s viewpoint. Unlike numerical exercises, which give a somewhat narrow understanding of the problem, simulation exercises provide a holistic view of performance, which students, manufacturers and operators will find invaluable.

The book initially covers the theory of gas turbine performance from a design and off-design point of view, including transient analysis, and gives much detail on these two very important aspects of engine performance. The latter part of the book revisits the earlier chapters, using the simulators to highlight in detail the issues facing industrial gas turbines in the real world. The simulators are effectively virtual engines with respect to performance, deterioration, emissions, control, and life usage. There is also a useful life cycle calculation module. This provides a clear view of the operability of the gas turbine under different conditions.

# Foreword

The book includes numerous simulation exercises. These exercises are not restrictively academic but include much of the author’s experience, gained from an operator’s viewpoint. Unlike numerical exercises, which give a somewhat narrow understanding of the problem, simulation exercises provide a holistic view of performance, which students, manufacturers and operators will find invaluable.

# Preface

The use of industrial gas turbines is widespread in many industries that require power. The power is used to generate electricity or drive equipment such as pumps and process compressors.
