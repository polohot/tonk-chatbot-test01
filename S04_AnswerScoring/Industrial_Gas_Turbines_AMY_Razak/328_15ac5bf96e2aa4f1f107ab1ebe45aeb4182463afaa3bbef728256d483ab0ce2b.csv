1. Determine the maximum generator power, gas turbine shaft power, gas power output, thermal efficiency and the gas thermal efficiency for the engine when operating at ISO conditions. Hence, calculate the isentropic efficiency of the power turbine. What is the creep life usage of the gas generator and power turbine? ISO conditions refer to an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, ambient pressure of 1.013 Bar, relative humidity of 60% and zero inlet and exhaust losses. What limits the power output from the gas turbine? Determine the emissions (as an emissions index) from the gas turbine and hence calculate the amount of NOx, CO and CO2 in tonnes/year.

on the changes in CO and CO. What is the impact on turbine creep life usage? The ambient pressure is 1.013 Bar and the inlet and exhaust losses are 100 mm water gauge.

If a standby engine is available, what is the impact on emissions when operating both engines at 50% power output? Comment on whether operating two engines is better than operating one engine at 32 MW.
