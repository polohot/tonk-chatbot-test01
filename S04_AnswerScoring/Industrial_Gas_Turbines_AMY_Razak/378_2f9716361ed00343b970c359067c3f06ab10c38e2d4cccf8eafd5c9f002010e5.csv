# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

v₁ and v₂ are the fluid velocities at inlet and exit of the system as shown in Fig. A1,

g(z₁ – z₂) is the potential energy change, where g is the gravitational constant (kJ/kg)

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

v₁ and v₂ are the fluid velocities at inlet and exit of the system as shown in Fig. A1,

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

v₁ and v₂ are the fluid velocities at inlet and exit of the system as shown in Fig. A1,

g(z₁ – z₂) is the potential energy change, where g is the gravitational constant (kJ/kg)

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

v₁ and v₂ are the fluid velocities at inlet and exit of the system as shown in Fig. A1,

g(z₁ – z₂) is the potential energy change, where g is the gravitational constant (kJ/kg)

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

v₁ and v₂ are the fluid velocities at inlet and exit of the system as shown in Fig. A1,

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

Therefore,

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

v₁ and v₂ are the fluid velocities at inlet and exit of the system as shown in Fig. A1,

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

2

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

# A1.1 Steady flow energy equation

A steady flow system is schematically represented in Fig. A1, where a fluid flows through the system at a steady rate while transferring work and heat with the surroundings.

The steady flow energy equation is given by:

Q – W = (h1 – h2) + 1/2 (v2² – v1²) + (g z2 – z1)

where

- Q is the specific heat transfer, kJ/kg

Stations 1 and 2 refer to the inlet and exit of the thermodynamic system. The term ‘specific’ refers to work and heat transfer, and to thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy for a unit of mass of the fluid.

The change in elevation, z₁ – z₂, is often small enough to be neglected, thus the steady flow energy equation reduces to:

Q – W = (h₁ – h₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A2]

For a perfect gas, h = cₚ × Tₛ, where cₚ is the specific heat at constant pressure, Tₛ is the static temperature and h is the static specific enthalpy of the gas. Thus, for a perfect gas, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

Q – W = cₚ (Tₛ₁ – Tₛ₂) + 1 v²(v₂ – v₁)                      [A3]

# A1.2 Stagnation temperatures and pressures

In calculating the work and heat transfer in thermodynamic systems, the total work and heat transfer are often required. Therefore, the changes in kinetic energy which occur in thermodynamic processes such as compression, expansion and heat transfer need to be accounted for. The changes in kinetic energy can be accounted for by using the concept of stagnation or total values of the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy.

The stagnation thermodynamic property of a fluid is the property of the fluid which is brought to rest, reversibly and adiabatically, without any work transfer. Therefore, the steady flow energy equation becomes:

H – h + 1/2 v² = 0

Therefore,

H = h + 1/2 v²

where H is the specific stagnation or total enthalpy, h is the specific static enthalpy and v is the velocity.

When the fluid is a perfect gas, H = cₚ × T and h = cₚ × Tₛ, where T and Tₛ are the stagnation (or total) temperature and static temperature, respectively.

# Steady flow energy equation and stagnation properties

T = Ts + 1 v2 /cp

1/2v2/cp is referred to as the dynamic temperature. Thus, the total temperature is equal to the sum of the static temperature and the dynamic temperature. The steady flow Equation [A3] becomes:

Q – W = cp(T1 – T2) [A5]

The total (specific) work done (i.e. work done per unit flow of fluid) during a compression process with no heat transfer (adiabatically) is given by:

W = – cp(T2 – T1)

And for a heating process (i.e. no work transfer) the specific heat transfer:

Q = cp(T2 – T1)

Thus, for a flow in a duct without heat and work transfer, the total temperature, T, remains constant.

By employing total or stagnation temperatures, there is no need to calculate the kinetic energy terms in the steady flow energy equation.
