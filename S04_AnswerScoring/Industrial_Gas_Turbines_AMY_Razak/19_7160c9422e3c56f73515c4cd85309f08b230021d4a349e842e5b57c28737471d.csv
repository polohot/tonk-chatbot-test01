For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

# 20 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

# 22 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

# 20 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

# 2.6 Ideal simple cycle gas turbine

The ideal gas turbine can be considered as a heat engine because it works in a cycle exchanging heat from a heat source and exhausting heat to a heat sink.

4. heat rejection (constant pressure).

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high

When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high

When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency.

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,

When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,

When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

where

- m is the mass flow rate

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,

The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero.

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

# 2.6 Ideal simple cycle gas turbine

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific

In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁. The temperature–entropy diagram in Fig. ",What is the equation for the change in enthalpy for an ideal gas as mentioned in the text?,A1,"The equation is ΔH = m × cp × ΔT, where m is the mass flow rate, cp is the specific heat at constant pressure, and ΔT is the temperature change.",2.71875,2.8125,3.640625,1.6953125,0.765625

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

# 2.6 Ideal simple cycle gas turbine

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram.

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given

increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
high simple cycle thermal efficiencies in the order of 40%. However, for discussion and illustrative purposes,
low values for maximum cycle temperature will be assumed as these yield low and realistic pressure ratio
ranges when explaining the features discussed up to now. The performance of gas turbines using higher values
for maximum cycle temperatures will be considered later in this chapter and will illustrate how efficient
gas turbines are. For a given gas, it has been shown that the thermal efficiency of an ideal simple cycle gas
turbine is dependent only on the pressure ratio, whereas the specific work is dependent on the pressure ratio
and the maximum to minimum cycle temperature. This is illustrated in

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

# 2.6 Variation of thermal efficiency and specific work with compressor pressure ratio.

Fig. 2.6, which also shows the effect of maximum cycle temperature, specific work curve has been displayed for three values of T₃, which correspond to 700 K, 800 K and 900 K. The limiting thermal efficiencies for each value of T₃ are also shown and they correspond to the points where the specific work is zero. Note also that the optimum compressor pressure ratio increases with T₃ when the specific work is a maximum, as described by Equation 2.21.

It is worth pointing out that the maximum thermal efficiency points shown in Fig. 2.6 correspond to the Carnot thermal efficiency for each T₃ value. Although the Carnot efficiency can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine, at these compressor pressure ratios, the turbine work done equals the compressor work absorbed, hence resulting in zero net specific work. Thus the thermal efficiency cannot continue to be increased simply by increasing the pressure ratio as implied by Equation 2.19. The maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by the ideal simple cycle gas turbine is indeed the Carnot efficiency, therefore complying with the second law of thermodynamics.

# 2.7 Ideal regenerative gas turbine cycle

It has been seen from the analysis of an ideal simple cycle gas turbine that the maximum specific work occurs when the turbine exit temperature, T₄, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T₂, and the optimum pressure ratio is determined by Equation 2.21. At pressure ratios below this optimum value the turbine exit temperature, T₄, will be higher than the compressor.

discharge temperature, T₂. Clearly, there is potential to transfer some of the heat rejected by the simple cycle to the compressor discharge air, thereby reducing the heat input. Although the specific work is reducing, the resultant reduction in heat input more than compensates for the loss in specific work and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. This is the concept of the regenerative gas turbine cycle. In effect some of the degraded energy is being utilised to produce useful work. A schematic representation of the regenerative gas turbine cycle is shown in Fig. 2.7. The only additional component is the heat exchanger, needed to transfer heat from the turbine exit to the compressor discharge.

The temperature at the exit of the turbine is cooled ideally from T₅ to T₂, while the compressor discharge gas is heated from T₂ to T₅ at point 3 by the heat exchanger. The heat source increases the gas temperature further from T₃ to T₄, which is now the maximum cycle temperature and the temperature at point 6 is reduced by the heat sink from T₂ to T₁.

For an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy can be represented by:

ΔH = m × cp × ΔT [2.6]

where

- m is the mass flow rate
- cp is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure

# 16 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

ΔT is the total temperature change in the thermodynamic system. We can therefore rewrite the steady flow energy Equation 2.5 as:

Q – W = m × cₚ × ΔT [2.7]

# 2.5 Pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagram

Thermodynamic processes may be represented on a pressure–volume diagram and on a temperature–entropy diagram. Figure 2.2 shows an example of an isothermal expansion process in these respective diagrams, where the temperature of the gas remains constant during the thermodynamic process. The areas shown in the pressure–volume and temperature–entropy diagrams correspond to the work and heat transfers, respectively.

The work and heat transfers shown in Fig. 2.2 can be determined by solving the integrals:

∫ p dV and ∫ t dS, respectively. Note the increase in entropy during the expansion process on the temperature–entropy diagram.

Of the many thermodynamic processes that exist in the gas turbine, we are particularly interested in reversible and adiabatic processes, which are also known as isentropic processes. In such an ideal process both the heat transfer and the entropy changes are zero. Such a process is represented as a vertical straight line on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4.

# 2.6 Ideal simple cycle gas turbine

The ideal gas turbine can be considered as a heat engine because it works in a cycle exchanging heat from a heat source and exhausting heat to a heat sink.

1. compression (isentropic)
2. heat addition (constant pressure)
3. expansion (isentropic)
4. heat rejection (constant pressure).

The gas turbine cycle is best represented on a temperature–entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 2.4, which illustrates the thermodynamic processes involved.

From the steady flow energy equation, the adiabatic compression work required will be given by:

and the compressor discharge temperature, is given by:

T2 = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ–1 T1

[2.9]

where γ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas (cp/cv) and is known as the isentropic index, and cv is the specific heat at constant volume.

Similarly, the adiabatic expansion work and expander exit temperature, T4, is given by:

W3 4 = cp(T3 – T4)

[2.10]

T4 = ⌈ P4 ⌉γ–1 T3

[2.11]

The heat input is given by Equation 2.12. Since the work done in the combustion system is zero, the heat input, Q2 3, is:

Q2 3 = cp(T3 – T2)

[2.12]

The net work done by the cycle per unit mass flow rate (specific work, Wne t) is the difference between the expansion and compression work. Hence:

Wn e t = cp(T3 – T4) – cp(T2 – T1)

[2.13]

The cycle thermal efficiency, ηt h, is defined as the ratio of the net work done and the heat input. Hence the thermal efficiency is given by:

ηt h = Wne t

[2.14]

which can be rewritten as:

ηt h = cp (T3 – T4) – cp (T2 – T1)

[2.15]

ηt h = (T3 – T2) – (T4 – T1)

[2.16]

ηt h = 1 – T1

[2.17]

Substituting for T2 and T4 using Equations 2.9 and 2.11, respectively, into Equation 2.17 reduces Equation 2.17 to:

# Thermodynamics of gas turbine cycles

ηth = 1 – T1 / T2                                                   [2.18]

Hence the ideal gas turbine cycle thermal efficiency is dependent only on the compressor temperature ratio. Comparing the ideal gas turbine cycle efficiency with the corresponding Carnot efficiency (ηth = 1 – T1 / T3), the ideal gas turbine efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency, since T2 is less than T3.

We can represent Equation 2.18 in terms of compressor pressure ratio using Equation 2.9 giving:

ηth = 1 – 1 / c                                                    [2.19]

where

c = ⌈ P2 ⌉γ / (P1)γ–1

The thermal efficiency will therefore increase with the pressure ratio, and maximum possible thermal efficiency is achieved when T2 tends to T3, as this corresponds to the Carnot efficiency. The thermal efficiency will be zero as the pressure ratio tends to 1, which now results in T3 tending to T4. The temperature–entropy diagram for these limiting cases is shown in Fig. 2.5.

The specific work Wₙₑₜ given in Equation 2.13 can be rewritten as:

Wₙₑₜ = cₚ T₁( c – 1)⌈ T³  – c⌉                                 [2.20]

Thus, for a given gas the specific work of the ideal gas turbine cycle depends on the compressor pressure ratio,
T /T                          P₂/P₁, the maximum to minimum temperature ratio, T³/T¹, for a given
compressor inlet temperature, T₁. Increasing the temperature T₁ will increase the specific work, whereas
increasing the pressure ratio will increase the specific work initially, but this will decrease at high
pressure ratios. When the compressor pressure ratio equals unity, the specific work, Wₙₑₜ, will be zero.
When the compressor pressure ratio is increased such that c = (P₂/P₁)(γ–1)/γ, which is equal to T₃/T₁ from
Equation 2.19, the specific work will again reduce to zero. Thus, the maximum specific work occurs at some
pressure ratio between these values, and this optimum pressure ratio will depend on γ, T₁ and T₃/T₁.

Differentiating Equation 2.20 with respect to c enables us to find an expression for the compressor pressure
ratio, which will correspond to the case when the specific work is a maximum. Thus, it can be shown that:

Copt =   T3                                                   [2.21]

where

Copt = (propt)γ

and propt is the optimum pressure ratio.

At the optimum pressure ratio, when the specific work is a maximum, the expander or turbine exit temperature,
T4, is equal to the compressor discharge temperature, T2.

Figure 2.5 shows the temperature–entropy diagram for the limit cases and the optimum case when the specific
work is a maximum.

Advanced gas turbines operate at very high maximum cycle temperatures up to about 1800 K and achieve very
