# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure on engine performance

The impact of the change in ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Chapter 11, where the negative impact of high ambient temperatures on performance was observed. Another factor that affects engine performance is the ambient pressure, where low ambient pressure reduces maximum power output from the engine. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to investigate the effects of the change in ambient pressure on engine performance.

The ambient pressure may change quite significantly at a given elevation. At sea level it may vary from 1.04 Bar to 0.96 Bar for a high pressure day and a low pressure day, respectively. This represents about an 8% change in ambient pressure corresponding to those days. Gas turbines that operate at high elevations, where the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level will show a reduced power output. For example, at an elevation of 1000 metres, the ambient pressure would be about 0.9 Bar on an ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) day. However, the ambient temperature at this altitude will be lower, thus partly compensating for the reduced power output.

To cover this ambient pressure range, the ambient pressure will be varied from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour (3600 seconds). Also considered will be two operating cases, which correspond to high power and low power operating conditions.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure on engine performance

The impact of the change in ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Chapter 11, where the negative impact of high ambient temperatures on performance was observed. Another factor that affects engine performance is the ambient pressure, where low ambient pressure reduces maximum power output from the engine. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to investigate the effects of the change in ambient pressure on engine performance.

The ambient pressure may change quite significantly at a given elevation. At sea level it may vary from 1.04 Bar to 0.96 Bar for a high pressure day and a low pressure day, respectively. This represents about an 8% change in ambient pressure corresponding to those days. Gas turbines that operate at high elevations, where the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level will show a reduced power output. For example, at an elevation of 1000 metres, the ambient pressure would be about 0.9 Bar on an ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) day. However, the ambient temperature at this altitude will be lower, thus partly compensating for the reduced power output.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure on engine performance

The impact of the change in ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Chapter 11, where the negative impact of high ambient temperatures on performance was observed. Another factor that affects engine performance is the ambient pressure, where low ambient pressure reduces maximum power output from the engine. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to investigate the effects of the change in ambient pressure on engine performance.

The ambient pressure may change quite significantly at a given elevation. At sea level it may vary from 1.04 Bar to 0.96 Bar for a high pressure day and a low pressure day, respectively. This represents about an 8% change in ambient pressure corresponding to those days. Gas turbines that operate at high elevations, where the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level will show a reduced power output. For example, at an elevation of 1000 metres, the ambient pressure would be about 0.9 Bar on an ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) day. However, the ambient temperature at this altitude will be lower, thus partly compensating for the reduced power output.

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure on engine performance

The impact of the change in ambient temperature on engine performance was considered in Chapter 11, where the negative impact of high ambient temperatures on performance was observed. Another factor that affects engine performance is the ambient pressure, where low ambient pressure reduces maximum power output from the engine. The two-shaft gas turbine simulator will now be used to investigate the effects of the change in ambient pressure on engine performance.

The ambient pressure may change quite significantly at a given elevation. At sea level it may vary from 1.04 Bar to 0.96 Bar for a high pressure day and a low pressure day, respectively. This represents about an 8% change in ambient pressure corresponding to those days. Gas turbines that operate at high elevations, where the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level will show a reduced power output. For example, at an elevation of 1000 metres, the ambient pressure would be about 0.9 Bar on an ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) day. However, the ambient temperature at this altitude will be lower, thus partly compensating for the reduced power output.

To cover this ambient pressure range, the ambient pressure will be varied from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 1 hour (3600 seconds). Also considered will be two operating cases, which correspond to high power and low power operating conditions.
