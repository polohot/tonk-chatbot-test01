14.29 Trends in gas turbine emissions when switching from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel.

# Power augmentation

from natural gas to diesel fuel, when the CO increases from 8 ppmv to 18 ppmv, thus more than doubling the emission of CO.

When operating with diesel fuel, the atomisation process results in localised air–fuel mixtures nearer to stoichiometric compared with the case of natural gas fuel, although the overall air–fuel ratio would be much higher. Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

14.29 Trends in gas turbine emissions when switching from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel.

# Power augmentation

from natural gas to diesel fuel, when the CO increases from 8 ppmv to 18 ppmv, thus more than doubling the emission of CO.

When operating with diesel fuel, the atomisation process results in localised air–fuel mixtures nearer to stoichiometric compared with the case of natural gas fuel, although the overall air–fuel ratio would be much higher. Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

14.29 Trends in gas turbine emissions when switching from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel.

# Power augmentation

from natural gas to diesel fuel, when the CO increases from 8 ppmv to 18 ppmv, thus more than doubling the emission of CO.

When operating with diesel fuel, the atomisation process results in localised air–fuel mixtures nearer to stoichiometric compared with the case of natural gas fuel, although the overall air–fuel ratio would be much higher. Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

# Power augmentation

from natural gas to diesel fuel, when the CO increases from 8 ppmv to 18 ppmv, thus more than doubling the emission of CO.

When operating with diesel fuel, the atomisation process results in localised air–fuel mixtures nearer to stoichiometric compared with the case of natural gas fuel, although the overall air–fuel ratio would be much higher. Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

14.29 Trends in gas turbine emissions when switching from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel.

# Power augmentation

from natural gas to diesel fuel, when the CO increases from 8 ppmv to 18 ppmv, thus more than doubling the emission of CO.

When operating with diesel fuel, the atomisation process results in localised air–fuel mixtures nearer to stoichiometric compared with the case of natural gas fuel, although the overall air–fuel ratio would be much higher. Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.

14.29 Trends in gas turbine emissions when switching from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel.

# Power augmentation

from natural gas to diesel fuel, when the CO increases from 8 ppmv to 18 ppmv, thus more than doubling the emission of CO.

When operating with diesel fuel, the atomisation process results in localised air–fuel mixtures nearer to stoichiometric compared with the case of natural gas fuel, although the overall air–fuel ratio would be much higher. Thus the higher flame temperatures that prevail in the vicinity of the burning liquid fuel droplets result in higher NOₓ emissions when burning liquid fuels such as diesel. Furthermore, the adiabatic flame temperature achieved when using diesel fuel is greater than that with natural gas due to the reduced presence of H₂O and this also contributes to higher NOₓ when burning diesel fuel. In Section 6.5, the importance of good atomisation and mixing in arresting the formation of CO was discussed. With gaseous fuels, good mixing is easily achieved compared with liquid fuels and therefore the formation of CO is reduced when burning natural gas.

The increase in CO2 is largely due to the higher carbon–hydrogen ratio and low LHV of diesel fuel compared with natural gas fuel. Figure 14.29 shows the trends in gas turbine emissions when the change is made from natural gas fuel to diesel fuel, where an increase in gas turbine emissions occurs. Figure 14.30 shows the trends in the fuel flow and valve position when the switch is made to diesel fuel operation. The figure also shows the trends in the air–fuel ratio and compressor inlet airflow.

The increase in fuel flow and fuel valve position is primarily due to the lower LHV of diesel fuel, thus resulting in a decrease in the air–fuel ratio.
