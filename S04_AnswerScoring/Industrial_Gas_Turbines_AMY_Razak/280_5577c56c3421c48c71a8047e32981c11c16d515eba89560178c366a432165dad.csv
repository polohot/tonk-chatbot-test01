# 18.4.1 Trends in fault indices

Hot end damage has been implemented by increasing the turbine capacity and decreasing its efficiency via fault indices. This is shown as a trend in Fig. 18.25, where it is observed that the turbine fouling fault index increases from 0% to 3%, while the efficiency fault index decreases from 0% to –2% over a period of 1 hour.

# 18.4.2 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratios

The increase in the turbine fouling fault index results in increased turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. If it is assumed that the maximum to minimum cycle, temperature ratio T₃/T₁, remains constant, then from the flow compatibility equation (Equation 8.1) the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, decreases. This is because the compressor non-dimensional flow remains essentially constant due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed lines.

Since the engine is on an EGT limit, any decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, and therefore in the turbine pressure ratio, causes the turbine entry temperature to decrease, which requires a further reduction in the compressor pressure ratio to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine. This is shown in Fig. ",At what ambient temperature is the engine constrained to operate on the EGT limit?,A1,The engine is constrained to operate on the EGT limit at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius.,0.79296875,0.6015625,3.125,0.9453125,0.1689453125

# 18.4.1 Trends in fault indices

Hot end damage has been implemented by increasing the turbine capacity and decreasing its efficiency via fault indices. This is shown as a trend in Fig. 18.25, where it is observed that the turbine fouling fault index increases from 0% to 3%, while the efficiency fault index decreases from 0% to –2% over a period of 1 hour.

# 18.4.2 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratios

The increase in the turbine fouling fault index results in increased turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. If it is assumed that the maximum to minimum cycle, temperature ratio T₃/T₁, remains constant, then from the flow compatibility equation (Equation 8.1) the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, decreases. This is because the compressor non-dimensional flow remains essentially constant due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed lines.

Since the engine is on an EGT limit, any decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, and therefore in the turbine pressure ratio, causes the turbine entry temperature to decrease, which requires a further reduction in the compressor pressure ratio to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine. This is shown in Fig. ",What is required to maintain flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine when the turbine entry temperature decreases?,A2,"To keep flow compatibility between compressor and turbine with decreasing turbine entry temperature, the compressor pressure ratio must be reduced further.",2.1875,2.390625,3.40625,1.6171875,0.3828125

# 18.4.2 Compressor characteristic and trends in pressure and temperature ratios

The increase in the turbine fouling fault index results in increased turbine non-dimensional flow capacity. If it is assumed that the maximum to minimum cycle, temperature ratio T₃/T₁, remains constant, then from the flow compatibility equation (Equation 8.1) the compressor pressure ratio, P₂/P₁, decreases. This is because the compressor non-dimensional flow remains essentially constant due to the steepness of the compressor non-dimensional speed lines.

Since the engine is on an EGT limit, any decrease in the compressor pressure ratio, and therefore in the turbine pressure ratio, causes the turbine entry temperature to decrease, which requires a further reduction in the compressor pressure ratio to maintain the flow compatibility between the compressor and the turbine. This is shown in Fig. ",Why does the compressor non-dimensional flow remain essentially constant?,A2,Steep compressor non-dimensional speed lines are the reason for the essentially constant compressor non-dimensional flow.,1.7890625,1.9765625,3.34375,1.3828125,0.267578125

The high-power case is simulated by setting the power demand from the generator to 60 MW. At an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, the engine is constrained to operate on the EGT limit.

# 18.4.1 Trends in fault indices

Hot end damage has been implemented by increasing the turbine capacity and decreasing its efficiency via fault indices. This is shown as a trend in Fig. 18.25, where it is observed that the turbine fouling fault index increases from 0% to 3%, while the efficiency fault index decreases from 0% to –2% over a period of 1 hour.
