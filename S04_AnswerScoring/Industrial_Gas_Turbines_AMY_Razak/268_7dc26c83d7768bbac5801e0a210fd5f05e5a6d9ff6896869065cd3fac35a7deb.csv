Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

# 17.2.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds.

The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

# 17.2.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

# 17.3 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine.

The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range.

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds.

This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient.

The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient.

The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency.

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

17.14 Trends in pressure during ambient pressure transient. discharge and turbine inlet pressure, as seen in Fig. 17.14. The decrease in the compressor inlet and turbine exhaust pressures is due to the transient (decreasing ambient pressure) which is being simulated.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

# 17.3 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range.

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

# 17.2.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range.

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient.

be considered as the high-power case will not differ from that discussed in Section 17.1. If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

# 17.2.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

# 17.3 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

# 17.15 Turbine creep life usage during ambient pressure transient.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

# 17.3 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

# 17.2.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃.

Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range.

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Therefore, for a given compressor inlet temperature, compressor temperature rise, ΔT21 will be approximately constant. Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.

Thus the decrease in the compressor mass flow rate results in a decrease in the compressor power absorbed. This can be seen in Fig. 17.11, which shows the trend in the compressor power absorbed during the ambient pressure transient. As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

As the power output from the gas turbine remains constant, the power developed by the turbine section/component also falls, to maintain the power demand from the generator as shown in Fig. 17.11.

The trends in compressor and turbine isentropic efficiency are also shown in Fig. 17.11. The small movement of the operating point on the compressor characteristic results in little or no change in the compressor efficiency. The turbine efficiency also shows a similar trend, and the small fall in turbine efficiency is associated with the small decrease in the turbine non-dimensional speed due to the increase in T3 as the ambient pressure falls.

# 17.2.4 Trends in flow

The trends in flows, air –fuel ratio and the fuel valve position during this transient are shown in Fig. 17.12. The decrease in air flow rate is due to the decrease in ambient pressure and near constant compressor non-dimensional.

Since the thermal efficiency improves and the power output from the gas turbine is constant, a decrease in fuel flow is observed as the ambient pressure.

# 17.2.5 Trends in temperature

Since the compressor inlet temperature, T₁ remains constant during this transient, the increase in the maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio results in an increase in the turbine entry temperature, T₃. Due to the constant compressor inlet temperature and constant compressor non-dimensional speed, the compressor non-dimensional temperature rise, ΔT₂₁/T₁, is approximately constant, as discussed in Section 8.1.1. Thus the compressor discharge temperature, T₂ remains essentially constant. The increase in T₃ results in an increase in the primary zone temperature as shown in Fig. 17.13, which displays the trends of these temperatures. For a given turbine entry temperature, the increase in turbine pressure ratio will decrease the exhaust gas temperature. However, the increase in the turbine entry temperature is sufficiently large to result in an increase in exhaust gas temperature, T₄. Also, the increase in the turbine entry temperature results in an increase in the turbine blade metal temperature.

# 17.2.7 Trends in creep life

It is observed that the turbine blade metal temperature increases during this transient, and this is shown in Fig. 17.13. It is also observed that the turbine power developed decreases (Fig. 17.11), hence the torque is reduced, which lowers the stresses in the turbine blade material. However, the effect of the increase in turbine metal temperature prevails and this results in an increase in turbine creep life usage, as is shown in Fig. 17.15.

At the beginning of this transient, the temperatures and stress in the turbine blades result in a creep life exceeding 500 000 hours. Although the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is improved under these conditions, the penalty paid is an increased creep life usage where the time to next overhaul is reduced from over 500 000 hours to just over 100 000 hours. Since the creep life usage is still over 75 000 hours, when overhauls are due for this engine, the increase in creep life usage is of little consequence unless creep life monitoring is implemented, in which event it is necessary to track such changes in creep life usage carefully. With such monitoring, the time between overhauls may be increased to over 75 000 hours, thus resulting in a useful reduction in maintenance costs.

# 17.2.8 Trends in gas turbine emissions

It is observed in Figure 17.13 that the primary zone temperature has increased and will increase the NOx emissions while decreasing CO emissions. But the combustion pressure decreases (Figure 17.14) and this change has the opposite effect on these emissions. However, it is also observed that the compressor pressure ratio increases and tends to suppress the full effect of the decrease in ambient pressure on the combustion pressure. Hence, the net effect is an increase in NOx, while decreasing CO, as shown in Fig. 17.16.

The increase in thermal efficiency has resulted in a decrease in fuel flow. The increase in thermal efficiency and reduced fuel flow therefore reduces both the CO2 mass flow rate and the emissions index as shown in Fig. 17.16, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

# 17.3 Effect of ambient pressure on engine performance at low power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

The effect of varying ambient pressure on engine performance has been simulated for a single-shaft gas turbine. The VIGV control system was set, in that case, such that the VIGV remained fully opened for most of the useful operating power range. The effect of varying the ambient pressure on the engine performance is now considered when the VIGV operates in the useful power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT set point to that of the EGT limit, as discussed in Section 16.4. The low power operating case will now

If the ambient temperature is low enough, such that the engine performance is limited by the power limit, then varying the ambient pressure will result in a different engine performance from that discussed in Section 17.1 when operating at high power. However, the performance will be similar to the case being considered here, as the power output from the gas turbine remains constant during the ambient pressure transient.

The power demand from the generator is set to 34 MW and the ambient pressure is decreased from 1.03 Bar to 0.9 Bar in 3600 seconds. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and 60%, respectively.
