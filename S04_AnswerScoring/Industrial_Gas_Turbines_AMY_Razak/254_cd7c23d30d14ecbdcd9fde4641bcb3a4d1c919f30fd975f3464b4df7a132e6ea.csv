# 16.27 Trends in gas turbine emissions during ambient temperature transient.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

# 16.27 Trends in gas turbine emissions during ambient temperature transient.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

# 16.27 Trends in gas turbine emissions during ambient temperature transient.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

# 16.4 Effect of ambient temperature on engine performance at high power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

# 16.27 Trends in gas turbine emissions during ambient temperature transient.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

# 16.4 Effect of ambient temperature on engine performance at high power (single-shaft gas turbine operating with an active variable inlet guide vane)

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

# 16.27 Trends in gas turbine emissions during ambient temperature transient.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity.

This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

the normal operating power range (60% to 100%) of the gas turbine. It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2.

This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

It was stated in Section 16.1 that it is possible to operate the gas turbine when the VIGV is active during the normal operating power range. This is achieved by setting the EGT limit (set point) for VIGV control to that of the maximum EGT limit for the engine. In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

The net effect is an initial increase in NOx emissions due to the decrease in specific humidity followed by a decrease in NOx emissions due to the decrease in combustion temperature. The decrease in combustion temperature results in an increase in CO emissions during the period of operation when the VIGV is fully opened. During the period when the VIGV closes, there is an increase in combustion temperature while the combustion pressure decreases. The ambient temperature when the VIGV closes is also low (about –10 degrees Celsius) and therefore the specific humidity is low. This results in a small increase in NOₓ emissions, while the CO emissions remain essentially constant.

There is a decrease in CO2 emissions during the period when the VIGV remains fully opened due to the increase in the gas turbine thermal efficiency. Since the thermal efficiency is essentially constant during the period when the VIGV closes, the CO2 emissions also remain approximately constant during this period of engine operation.

In this case the EGT will remain at the limiting value at low power outputs from the gas turbine provided the VIGV is not fully closed. Such operation of the gas turbine results in approximately constant air to fuel ratio and is a suitable means of implementing dry low emissions (DLE) combustion systems.

While operating at low powers (say 70%) the EGT will be maintained at the maximum/limiting value and the VIGV will be partly closed. Any attempt to increase the power output (greater than 70%) will now require the EGT to exceed its limiting value. The control system will prevent this in order to protect the turbine from overheating. This is achieved by the control system using low signal selection where the lowest error is used to change the fuel flow as discussed in Section 10.2. Thus, it will not be possible to increase the power output of the gas turbine unless some remedial action is taken. One method of overcoming this problem is to employ an open loop control system, when the power demand is increased as discussed in Section 10.4.2. The open loop response has been implemented in the simulator, resulting in the opening of the VIGV fully for a fixed period. During this period the EGT will decrease, thus providing the necessary EGT margin or error (i.e. the difference between the EGT limit and EGT) in the engine control system to increase the fuel flow and thus the power output from the gas turbine. In practice, the EGT limit for VIGV control would also be set to be slightly lower, by say 2 degrees, than the maximum EGT limit. This will prevent unnecessary VIGV operation as the ambient temperature changes during maximum power operation.

The ambient temperature transient has been repeated as described in Section 16.2, where the ambient pressure, inlet and exhaust losses and relative humidity were held constant at 1.013 Bar, 100 mm water gauge and 60% relative humidity. The trends in the parameters discussed are the same during the period when the engine power output is limited by the EGT (i.e. high ambient temperature operation when the VIGV is fully opened). It is only when the engine performance is power limited that the differences in performance are seen when compared with the case discussed in Section 16.2 above.

# 16.4.1 Trends in temperature

As stated above, the trends in temperature during the period when the EGT limits the power output from the gas turbine are the same as those shown in Fig. 16.8. When the engine is limited by power output, and the VIGV closes
