# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

The opening of the VIGV. The turbine efficiency remains essentially constant due to the small change in turbine entry temperature.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

The opening of the VIGV. The turbine efficiency remains essentially constant due to the small change in turbine entry temperature.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

The opening of the VIGV. The turbine efficiency remains essentially constant due to the small change in turbine entry temperature.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine.

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.

17.19 Trends in compressor and turbine power and efficiency. (see Figs 17.12 and 17.24). To maintain the constant power demand from the generator, the turbine power also decreases with the ambient pressure. The smaller decrease in mass flow rate results in a smaller increase in T₃/T₁ to maintain the required power out from the gas turbine (i.e. the specific work increase in this case is smaller compared with the previous case discussed in Section 17.2). The compressor efficiency increases and this is due to the

# Simulating the effect of change in ambient pressure

The opening of the VIGV. The turbine efficiency remains essentially constant due to the small change in turbine entry temperature.

The increase in the compressor pressure ratio and maximum to minimum cycle temperature ratio increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. This is shown in Fig. ",Why is the decrease in compressor power absorbed smaller when the VIGV is opened compared to when it remains closed?,A3,"A greater mass flow rate decrease occurs with the VIGV closed, resulting in a more substantial power absorbed reduction.",1.5390625,1.6484375,3.21875,1.4609375,0.34765625

# 17.3.2 Trends in power and efficiency

The opening of the VIGV increases the compressor non-dimensional flow, as shown in Fig. 17.17. The decrease in ambient pressure and thus the compressor inlet pressure are sufficient to decrease the mass flow rate through the compressor. Although there is a small increase in the compressor discharge temperature, the decrease in air flow rate results in a reduction in the compressor absorbed power, as shown in Fig. 17.19. However, the decrease in the compressor power absorbed is smaller than in the case when the VIGV remained opened, as shown in Fig. 17.11. This is due to the decrease in mass flow rate through the compressor being greater in the previous case.
