The combustion primary zone temperature increases while the combustion pressure decreases, as discussed in Section 18.2.2.

It has been shown that the turbine metal temperature increases during this simulation of compressor fouling, mainly because of the increase in the turbine entry temperature (Fig. 18.15). Although there is a reduction in the thermal efficiency (%),

# 18.2.6 Trends in gas turbine emissions

The combustion primary zone temperature increases while the combustion pressure decreases, as discussed in Section 18.2.2. Although the decrease in combustion pressure would reduce NOx, the increase in combustion temperature is sufficient to result in an increase in the NOx emissions. These changes in combustion pressures and temperatures have little effect on CO emissions, which remain essentially constant.

The decrease in the gas turbine thermal efficiency results in an increase in the CO2 emissions index.
