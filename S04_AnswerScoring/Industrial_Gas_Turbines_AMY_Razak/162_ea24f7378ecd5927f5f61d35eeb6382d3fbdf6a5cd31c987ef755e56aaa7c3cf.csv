# 10 Principles of engine control systems and transient performance

The power output from a gas turbine is determined by fuel flow (thermal input), and the control system must ensure that the desired power output is achieved. However, the control system must also protect the engine from exceeding any design limits. These limits include component speeds, temperatures and operating regions which can result in compressor surge.

The control strategy normally involves a set point and the control system drives the engine towards the set point. In the case of power generation, the set point will be the required power output from the generator. In mechanical drive applications such as a process compressor, the set point could be the discharge or suction pressure, compressor speed or inlet flow of the compressor. If the necessary power output or set point is not achieved, the control system will alter the fuel flow to the engine until the set point or required power is attained.

There are two groups of control systems, which are referred to as the open and closed loop control systems. In an open loop control system, the input (fuel flow) to the control system is independent of the output (generator output) and the input usually acts for a period of time after which the output is expected to have reached the required set point. In such a control system, the output seldom reaches the set point and the control system usually leaves an offset between the output and the set point.

In a closed loop control system, the offset left by the open loop control system is used as the input to the closed loop controller to generate the output. By such means, it is possible to eliminate the offset and the control system output will then correspond to the set point. In a closed loop control system the offset is converted to an error which is calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point and used as the input to the controller. For example, if the power output from the load, such as an electrical generator, is 10 MW and the set point is 15 MW, the error will be (15 – 10)/15 × 100 = 33.33%, which is used to control the fuel valves that alter the power output from the gas turbine, eventually reducing the error to zero (i.e. steady state).

There are two groups of control systems, which are referred to as the open and closed loop control systems. In an open loop control system, the input (fuel flow) to the control system is independent of the output (generator output) and the input usually acts for a period of time after which the output is expected to have reached the required set point. In such a control system, the output seldom reaches the set point and the control system usually leaves an offset between the output and the set point.

In a closed loop control system, the offset left by the open loop control system is used as the input to the closed loop controller to generate the output. By such means, it is possible to eliminate the offset and the control system output will then correspond to the set point. In a closed loop control system the offset is converted to an error which is calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point and used as the input to the controller. For example, if the power output from the load, such as an electrical generator, is 10 MW and the set point is 15 MW, the error will be (15 – 10)/15 × 100 = 33.33%, which is used to control the fuel valves that alter the power output from the gas turbine, eventually reducing the error to zero (i.e. steady state).

# 10 Principles of engine control systems and transient performance

The power output from a gas turbine is determined by fuel flow (thermal input), and the control system must ensure that the desired power output is achieved. However, the control system must also protect the engine from exceeding any design limits. These limits include component speeds, temperatures and operating regions which can result in compressor surge.

The control strategy normally involves a set point and the control system drives the engine towards the set point. In the case of power generation, the set point will be the required power output from the generator. In mechanical drive applications such as a process compressor, the set point could be the discharge or suction pressure, compressor speed or inlet flow of the compressor. If the necessary power output or set point is not achieved, the control system will alter the fuel flow to the engine until the set point or required power is attained.

# 10 Principles of engine control systems and transient performance

The power output from a gas turbine is determined by fuel flow (thermal input), and the control system must ensure that the desired power output is achieved. However, the control system must also protect the engine from exceeding any design limits. These limits include component speeds, temperatures and operating regions which can result in compressor surge.

The control strategy normally involves a set point and the control system drives the engine towards the set point. In the case of power generation, the set point will be the required power output from the generator. In mechanical drive applications such as a process compressor, the set point could be the discharge or suction pressure, compressor speed or inlet flow of the compressor. If the necessary power output or set point is not achieved, the control system will alter the fuel flow to the engine until the set point or required power is attained.

There are two groups of control systems, which are referred to as the open and closed loop control systems. In an open loop control system, the input (fuel flow) to the control system is independent of the output (generator output) and the input usually acts for a period of time after which the output is expected to have reached the required set point. In such a control system, the output seldom reaches the set point and the control system usually leaves an offset between the output and the set point.

In a closed loop control system, the offset left by the open loop control system is used as the input to the closed loop controller to generate the output. By such means, it is possible to eliminate the offset and the control system output will then correspond to the set point. In a closed loop control system the offset is converted to an error which is calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point and used as the input to the controller. For example, if the power output from the load, such as an electrical generator, is 10 MW and the set point is 15 MW, the error will be (15 – 10)/15 × 100 = 33.33%, which is used to control the fuel valves that alter the power output from the gas turbine, eventually reducing the error to zero (i.e. steady state).

However, the control system must also protect the engine from exceeding any design limits. These limits include component speeds, temperatures and operating regions which can result in compressor surge.

The control strategy normally involves a set point and the control system drives the engine towards the set point. In the case of power generation, the set point will be the required power output from the generator. In mechanical drive applications such as a process compressor, the set point could be the discharge or suction pressure, compressor speed or inlet flow of the compressor. If the necessary power output or set point is not achieved, the control system will alter the fuel flow to the engine until the set point or required power is attained.

There are two groups of control systems, which are referred to as the open and closed loop control systems. In an open loop control system, the input (fuel flow) to the control system is independent of the output (generator output) and the input usually acts for a period of time after which the output is expected to have reached the required set point. In such a control system, the output seldom reaches the set point and the control system usually leaves an offset between the output and the set point.

In a closed loop control system, the offset left by the open loop control system is used as the input to the closed loop controller to generate the output. By such means, it is possible to eliminate the offset and the control system output will then correspond to the set point. In a closed loop control system the offset is converted to an error which is calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point and used as the input to the controller. For example, if the power output from the load, such as an electrical generator, is 10 MW and the set point is 15 MW, the error will be (15 – 10)/15 × 100 = 33.33%, which is used to control the fuel valves that alter the power output from the gas turbine, eventually reducing the error to zero (i.e. steady state).

For example, if the power output from the load, such as an electrical generator, is 10 MW and the set point is 15 MW, the error will be (15 – 10)/15 × 100 = 33.33%, which is used to control the fuel valves that alter the power output from the gas turbine, eventually reducing the error to zero (i.e. steady state).

# 10 Principles of engine control systems and transient performance

The power output from a gas turbine is determined by fuel flow (thermal input), and the control system must ensure that the desired power output is achieved. However, the control system must also protect the engine from exceeding any design limits. These limits include component speeds, temperatures and operating regions which can result in compressor surge.

The control strategy normally involves a set point and the control system drives the engine towards the set point. In the case of power generation, the set point will be the required power output from the generator. In mechanical drive applications such as a process compressor, the set point could be the discharge or suction pressure, compressor speed or inlet flow of the compressor. If the necessary power output or set point is not achieved, the control system will alter the fuel flow to the engine until the set point or required power is attained.

There are two groups of control systems, which are referred to as the open and closed loop control systems. In an open loop control system, the input (fuel flow) to the control system is independent of the output (generator output) and the input usually acts for a period of time after which the output is expected to have reached the required set point. In such a control system, the output seldom reaches the set point and the control system usually leaves an offset between the output and the set point.

In a closed loop control system, the offset left by the open loop control system is used as the input to the closed loop controller to generate the output. By such means, it is possible to eliminate the offset and the control system output will then correspond to the set point. In a closed loop control system the offset is converted to an error which is calculated as the percentage deviation from the set point and used as the input to the controller. For example, if the power output from the load, such as an electrical generator, is 10 MW and the set point is 15 MW, the error will be (15 – 10)/15 × 100 = 33.33%, which is used to control the fuel valves that alter the power output from the gas turbine, eventually reducing the error to zero (i.e. steady state).
