In any of these applications, the performance of the gas turbines is the end product that strongly influences the profitability of the business that employs them.

Industrial gas turbines often have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions that do not correspond to their design conditions. Therefore, understanding the performance of gas turbines at such operating conditions is particularly important, especially in a deregulated market.

Other factors in addition to the performance of gas turbines affect their operability. These factors include emissions, deterioration, life usage and controls. For example, legislation may result in emissions being too high and the means to control them could affect the engine performance and thus revenue. Gas turbine performance deterioration is inevitable. This could be due to compressor fouling, which can be easily rectified by compressor washing, or to more serious damage to compressors or turbines. Therefore, an understanding of performance deterioration is now paramount. Various engine operating limits are imposed by manufacturers and correspond to the exhaust gas turbine limit, speed and power. These are necessary to achieve suitable engine life, namely turbine creep life. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to ensure that such operating limits are not exceeded. Furthermore, it is also the job of the control system to ensure that any engine load changes occur safely.

Improving the understanding of the above issues has provided the impetus to write this book. The book begins with a brief revision of engineering thermodynamics before considering the design point performance of gas turbines, including both simple and complex cycles. The performance of gas turbine components (compressors, combustors and turbines) is also discussed. Means to improve dry low-emission combustion systems are included. The prediction and modelling of the off-design performance of gas turbines is discussed, including the modelling of complex cycles which employ intercooling, reheat and regeneration.

Control system performance, including the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines, is considered. Furthermore, the application of control systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion systems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.

The CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which correspond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine configurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in the field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of industrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas turbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:

1. simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on performance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of inlet and exhaust losses;
2. simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life and emissions;
3. simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using turbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on performance, creep life and emissions;
4. simulate control system performance on engine operability including proportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;
5. simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on performance and emissions.

There are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator. Exercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and operability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical exercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance and some worked examples are given.

The simulators include other useful features and can show:

1. impact on life cycle costs, revenue and profitability (including the impact of emissions taxes such as CO2 and NOx on life cycle costs and, thus, profitability);
2. output from the turbine inlet cooling simulation which can be used to evaluate the suitability of turbine inlet cooling for any gas turbine for a particular site;
3. trends for many engine parameters, including key parameters such as EGT and speeds that protect the engine from damage;
4. compressor characteristics and the operating point during engine transients;
5. bar charts;

In any of these applications, the performance of the gas turbines is the end product that strongly influences the profitability of the business that employs them.

Industrial gas turbines often have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions that do not correspond to their design conditions. Therefore, understanding the performance of gas turbines at such operating conditions is particularly important, especially in a deregulated market.

Other factors in addition to the performance of gas turbines affect their operability. These factors include emissions, deterioration, life usage and controls. For example, legislation may result in emissions being too high and the means to control them could affect the engine performance and thus revenue. Gas turbine performance deterioration is inevitable. This could be due to compressor fouling, which can be easily rectified by compressor washing, or to more serious damage to compressors or turbines. Therefore, an understanding of performance deterioration is now paramount. Various engine operating limits are imposed by manufacturers and correspond to the exhaust gas turbine limit, speed and power. These are necessary to achieve suitable engine life, namely turbine creep life. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to ensure that such operating limits are not exceeded. Furthermore, it is also the job of the control system to ensure that any engine load changes occur safely.

Improving the understanding of the above issues has provided the impetus to write this book. The book begins with a brief revision of engineering thermodynamics before considering the design point performance of gas turbines, including both simple and complex cycles. The performance of gas turbine components (compressors, combustors and turbines) is also discussed. Means to improve dry low-emission combustion systems are included. The prediction and modelling of the off-design performance of gas turbines is discussed, including the modelling of complex cycles which employ intercooling, reheat and regeneration.

Control system performance, including the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines, is considered. Furthermore, the application of control systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion systems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.

The CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which correspond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine configurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in the field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of industrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas turbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:

1. simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on performance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of inlet and exhaust losses;
2. simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life and emissions;
3. simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using turbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on performance, creep life and emissions;
4. simulate control system performance on engine operability including proportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;
5. simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on performance and emissions.

There are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator. Exercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and operability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical exercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance and some worked examples are given.

The simulators include other useful features and can show:

1. impact on life cycle costs, revenue and profitability (including the impact of emissions taxes such as CO2 and NOx on life cycle costs and, thus, profitability);
2. output from the turbine inlet cooling simulation which can be used to evaluate the suitability of turbine inlet cooling for any gas turbine for a particular site;

deterioration and the importance of such detection and rectification are also discussed. Control system performance, including the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines, is considered. Furthermore, the application of control systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion systems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.

The CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which correspond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine configurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in the field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of industrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas turbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:

1. simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on performance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of inlet and exhaust losses;
2. simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life and emissions;
3. simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using turbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on performance, creep life and emissions;
4. simulate control system performance on engine operability including proportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;
5. simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on performance and emissions.

There are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator. Exercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and operability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical exercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance and some worked examples are given.

The simulators include other useful features and can show:

1. impact on life cycle costs, revenue and profitability (including the impact of emissions taxes such as CO2 and NOx on life cycle costs and, thus, profitability);
2. output from the turbine inlet cooling simulation which can be used to evaluate the suitability of turbine inlet cooling for any gas turbine for a particular site;
3. trends for many engine parameters, including key parameters such as EGT and speeds that protect the engine from damage;
4. compressor characteristics and the operating point during engine transients;
5. bar charts;
6. simulated data that can be exported to other computer packages (e.g. Microsoft Excel spreadsheets).

Industrial gas turbines often have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions that do not correspond to their design conditions. Therefore, understanding the performance of gas turbines at such operating conditions is particularly important, especially in a deregulated market.

This could be due to compressor fouling, which can be easily rectified by compressor washing, or to more serious damage to compressors or turbines. Therefore, an understanding of performance deterioration is now paramount.

Industrial gas turbines often have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions that do not correspond to their design conditions. Therefore, understanding the performance of gas turbines at such operating conditions is particularly important, especially in a deregulated market.

Other factors in addition to the performance of gas turbines affect their operability. These factors include emissions, deterioration, life usage and controls. For example, legislation may result in emissions being too high and the means to control them could affect the engine performance and thus revenue. Gas turbine performance deterioration is inevitable. This could be due to compressor fouling, which can be easily rectified by compressor washing, or to more serious damage to compressors or turbines. Therefore, an understanding of performance deterioration is now paramount.

Improving the understanding of the above issues has provided the impetus to write this book. The book begins with a brief revision of engineering thermodynamics before considering the design point performance of gas turbines, including both simple and complex cycles. The performance of gas turbine components (compressors, combustors and turbines) is also discussed. Means to improve dry low-emission combustion systems are included.

Furthermore, the application of control systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion systems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.

The CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which correspond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine configurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in the field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of industrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas turbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:

1. simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on performance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of inlet and exhaust losses;
2. simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life and emissions;
3. simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using turbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on performance, creep life and emissions;
4. simulate control system performance on engine operability including proportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;
5. simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on performance and emissions.

There are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator. Exercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and operability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical exercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance and some worked examples are given.

Improving the understanding of the above issues has provided the impetus to write this book. The book begins with a brief revision of engineering thermodynamics before considering the design point performance of gas turbines, including both simple and complex cycles. The performance of gas turbine components (compressors, combustors and turbines) is also discussed. Means to improve dry low-emission combustion systems are included.

Control system performance, including the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines, is considered. Furthermore, the application of control systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion systems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.

The CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which correspond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine configurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in the field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of industrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas turbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:

1. simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on performance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of inlet and exhaust losses;
2. simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life and emissions;
3. simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using turbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on performance, creep life and emissions;
4. simulate control system performance on engine operability including proportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;
5. simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on performance and emissions.

There are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator. Exercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and operability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical exercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance and some worked examples are given.

The simulators include other useful features and can show:

1. impact on life cycle costs, revenue and profitability (including the impact of emissions taxes such as CO2 and NOx on life cycle costs and, thus, profitability);
2. output from the turbine inlet cooling simulation which can be used to evaluate the suitability of turbine inlet cooling for any gas turbine for a particular site;
3. trends for many engine parameters, including key parameters such as EGT and speeds that protect the engine from damage;
4. compressor characteristics and the operating point during engine transients;
5. bar charts;
6. simulated data that can be exported to other computer packages (e.g. Microsoft Excel spreadsheets).

In any of these applications, the performance of the gas turbines is the end product that strongly influences the profitability of the business that employs them.

Industrial gas turbines often have to operate for prolonged periods at conditions that do not correspond to their design conditions. Therefore, understanding the performance of gas turbines at such operating conditions is particularly important, especially in a deregulated market.

Other factors in addition to the performance of gas turbines affect their operability. These factors include emissions, deterioration, life usage and controls. For example, legislation may result in emissions being too high and the means to control them could affect the engine performance and thus revenue. Gas turbine performance deterioration is inevitable. This could be due to compressor fouling, which can be easily rectified by compressor washing, or to more serious damage to compressors or turbines. Therefore, an understanding of performance deterioration is now paramount. Various engine operating limits are imposed by manufacturers and correspond to the exhaust gas turbine limit, speed and power. These are necessary to achieve suitable engine life, namely turbine creep life. It is the responsibility of the engine control system to ensure that such operating limits are not exceeded. Furthermore, it is also the job of the control system to ensure that any engine load changes occur safely.

Improving the understanding of the above issues has provided the impetus to write this book. The book begins with a brief revision of engineering thermodynamics before considering the design point performance of gas turbines, including both simple and complex cycles. The performance of gas turbine components (compressors, combustors and turbines) is also discussed. Means to improve dry low-emission combustion systems are included. The prediction and modelling of the off-design performance of gas turbines is discussed, including the modelling of complex cycles which employ intercooling, reheat and regeneration. The impact and detection of performance

deterioration and the importance of such detection and rectification are also discussed. Control system performance, including the prediction of the transient performance of gas turbines, is considered. Furthermore, the application of control systems to improve the performance of dry low-emission combustion systems by the use of variable geometry components is discussed.

The CD accompanying the book contains two gas turbine simulators, which correspond to single-shaft and two-shaft engines. These two engine configurations cover the vast majority of industrial gas turbines operating in the field. Much of the text describing the performance and operability of industrial gas turbines can be illustrated and enlivened by the use of these gas turbine simulators. The simulators are used extensively in Parts II and III to:

1. simulate the effects of ambient temperature, pressure and humidity on performance, turbine creep life and emissions, including the impact of inlet and exhaust losses;
2. simulate the effects of engine deterioration on performance, creep life and emissions;
3. simulate the impact of power augmentation and enhancement using turbine inlet cooling, peak rating, water injection and optimisation on performance, creep life and emissions;
4. simulate control system performance on engine operability including proportional off-set, integral wind-up and engine trips;
5. simulate the effect of a change in fuel type (e.g. natural gas or diesel) on performance and emissions.

There are nearly 50 simulation exercises included using each simulator. Exercises using simulators give a holistic view of engine performance and operability which numerical exercises fail to achieve. Nevertheless, numerical exercises are essential to augment the understanding of engine performance and some worked examples are given.

The simulators include other useful features and can show:

1. impact on life cycle costs, revenue and profitability (including the impact of emissions taxes such as CO2 and NOx on life cycle costs and, thus, profitability);
