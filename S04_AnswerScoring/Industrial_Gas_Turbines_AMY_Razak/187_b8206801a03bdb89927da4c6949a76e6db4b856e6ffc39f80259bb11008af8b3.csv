# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# 290 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

# Part II

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.

# Simulating the performance of a two-shaft gas turbine

Much of what has already been discussed is rather complex, particularly engine off-design performance prediction. The use of a gas turbine simulator can illustrate eloquently these rather complex concepts. The gas turbine simulators will now be used to re-visit many of the preceding chapters, particularly off-design performance prediction, performance deterioration, gas turbine emissions, turbine creep life usage and the engine control system.

The gas turbine simulator is based on the quasi-steady-state model, using time constants to simulate the transient effects. Although such simulators are strictly only valid under steady-state conditions, much useful insight into engine operation can be achieved during transients using such simulators. They are excellent as training simulators. The concept of component matching, as discussed in Chapter 7, has been extensively used in building the simulator, thus making it capable of illustrating much of what has been discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 in detail, including turbine creep life usage and engine emissions as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Two engine simulators are used and they correspond to a single-shaft and a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The single-shaft gas turbine simulator is also capable of simulating the performance of a single-shaft gas turbine when variable inlet guide vanes are incorporated. The single-shaft gas turbine is the most common engine configuration used in power generation and the use of the two-shaft gas turbine configuration operating with a free power turbine is widespread in mechanical drive applications. Although their use is widespread in mechanical drive, there are also a significant number of gas turbines using a two-shaft configuration employed in power generation. Thus, these two simulators cover the vast majority of gas turbines operating in the field. Simulation exercises provided in Chapter 21 are included to help readers to improve their understanding of gas turbine performance and operation.

# Simulating the effects of ambient temperature on engine performance, emissions and turbine life usage

The engine simulator discussed here is based on a two-shaft gas turbine operating with a free power turbine. The engine corresponds to an advanced aero-derived industrial gas turbine having an ISO rating of about 20 MW. The simulator assumes that the driven load is an electrical generator.

# 11.1 Compressor running line

The reasons why an approximately unique running line occurs in a multi-shaft engine were discussed in Section 8.1.2. This can be demonstrated by producing the engine running line on the compressor characteristic using the simulator. This is achieved by running the simulator at different power and ambient conditions, increasing any engine limits such as exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and gas generator speed to produce the complete running line.
