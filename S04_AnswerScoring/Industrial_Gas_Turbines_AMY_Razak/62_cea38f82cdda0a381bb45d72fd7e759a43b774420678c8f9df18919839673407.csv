A design parameter employed to limit the amount of diffusion is the de Haller number, which is simply the ratio of V₂/V₁. Experience has shown that, for acceptable losses, the de Haller number must not be less than 0.72. Also note an increase in tangential or ‘whirl’ velocity and therefore an increase in stage work input will occur with increased deflection.
