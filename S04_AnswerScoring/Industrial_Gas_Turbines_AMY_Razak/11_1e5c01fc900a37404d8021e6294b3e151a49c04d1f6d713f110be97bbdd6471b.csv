# 1 Introduction

The history of the gas turbine goes back to 1791, when John Barber took out a patent for ‘A Method for Rising Inflammable Air for the Purposes of Producing Motion and Facilitating Metallurgical Operations’. Many endeavours have been made since then particularly in the early 1900s to build an operational gas turbine. In 1903, a Norwegian, Aegidius Elling, built the first successful gas turbine using a rotary/dynamic compressor and turbines, and is credited with building the first gas turbine that produced excess power of about 8 kW (11 hp). By 1904 Elling had improved his design, achieving exhaust gas temperatures of 773 K (500 degrees Celsius), up from 673 K (400 degrees Celsius), producing about 33 kW (44 hp).
