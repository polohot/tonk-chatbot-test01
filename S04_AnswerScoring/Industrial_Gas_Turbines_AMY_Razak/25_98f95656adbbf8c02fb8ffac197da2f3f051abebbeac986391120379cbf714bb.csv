The evaluation of the heat exchanger effectiveness depends on the type of heat exchanger. The types of heat exchangers that have been employed by gas turbines are counter- and cross-flow recuperators, where the heat exchange takes place through a separating (conducting) wall, and regenerators. With regenerators, the hot exhaust gases heats a matrix, after which the cold air is passed through the matrix to absorb the heat given up by the hot gases. Thus, with regenerators the matrix requires a large thermal capacity whereas with recuperators, the separating wall requires a small thermal capacity and good conduction.

The effectiveness of the heat exchanger may be determined from its performance curves, which depend on the type of the heat exchanger, as discussed above. The performance curves for a heat exchanger are shown in Fig. 2.18, where the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is plotted against the number of transfer units (NTU).

The evaluation of the heat exchanger effectiveness depends on the type of heat exchanger. The types of heat exchangers that have been employed by gas turbines are counter- and cross-flow recuperators, where the heat exchange takes place through a separating (conducting) wall, and regenerators. With regenerators, the hot exhaust gases heats a matrix, after which the cold air is passed through the matrix to absorb the heat given up by the hot gases. Thus, with regenerators the matrix requires a large thermal capacity whereas with recuperators, the separating wall requires a small thermal capacity and good conduction.

The evaluation of the heat exchanger effectiveness depends on the type of heat exchanger. The types of heat exchangers that have been employed by gas turbines are counter- and cross-flow recuperators, where the heat exchange takes place through a separating (conducting) wall, and regenerators. With regenerators, the hot exhaust gases heats a matrix, after which the cold air is passed through the matrix to absorb the heat given up by the hot gases. Thus, with regenerators the matrix requires a large thermal capacity whereas with recuperators, the separating wall requires a small thermal capacity and good conduction.

The effectiveness of the heat exchanger may be determined from its performance curves, which depend on the type of the heat exchanger, as discussed above. The performance curves for a heat exchanger are shown in Fig. 2.18, where the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is plotted against the number of transfer units (NTU).

Number of transfer units (NTU) = AU/Cmin

2.18 Performance curves of a typical counter flow heat exchanger.

# 42 Industrial gas turbines – principles of performance

number of transfer units (NTU), for a series of thermal capacity ratios (C) of the cold and hot fluids. NTU is defined as:

NTU = UA                                                   [2.64]

where

- U is the overall heat transfer coefficient (kW/m2K)
- A is the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger (m2), and
- Cmin is the smallest thermal capacity of the two fluids (kW/kg K).

The calculation of the overall heat transfer coefficient is given in detail in Kays and London and in Simonson. ",Where can detailed calculations of the overall heat transfer coefficient be found?,A5,Kays and London's and Simonson's publications offer comprehensive calculation methods.,2.046875,2.109375,3.46875,1.015625,0.21484375
