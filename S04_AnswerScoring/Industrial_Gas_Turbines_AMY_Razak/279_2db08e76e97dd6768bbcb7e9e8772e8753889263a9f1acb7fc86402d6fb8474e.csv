It should not be thought that compressor washing and cleaning can be deferred because of the very small loss in engine performance resulting from

Operating point due to compressor fouling, at low power and with VIGV operation. The opening of the VIGV due to compressor fouling. It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

# 18.3.1 Displacement of the running line during compressor fouling

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling. When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power.

range, the characteristic is continuously changing, thus the running line for a clean compressor will also change. Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.

range, the characteristic is continuously changing, thus the running line for a clean compressor will also change. Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.

This shows an increase during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.24, where the VIGV position increases from 72% to about 86%.

It should not be thought that compressor washing and cleaning can be deferred because of the very small loss in engine performance resulting from

Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling.

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling. When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit.

range, the characteristic is continuously changing, thus the running line for a clean compressor will also change. Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively. ",How is hot end damage simulated in gas turbine models?,A4,"To mimic hot end damage, simulations adjust the turbine fouling index upwards by 3% and the efficiency index downwards by 2%.",1.203125,1.359375,3.265625,1.328125,0.216796875

This shows an increase during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.24, where the VIGV position increases from 72% to about 86%.

It should not be thought that compressor washing and cleaning can be deferred because of the very small loss in engine performance resulting from

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

# 18.3.1 Displacement of the running line during compressor fouling

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling. When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power.

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.

This shows an increase during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.24, where the VIGV position increases from 72% to about 86%.

It should not be thought that compressor washing and cleaning can be deferred because of the very small loss in engine performance resulting from

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

# 18.3.1 Displacement of the running line during compressor fouling

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling.

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.

This shows an increase during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.24, where the VIGV position increases from 72% to about 86%.

It should not be thought that compressor washing and cleaning can be deferred because of the very small loss in engine performance resulting from

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

# 18.3.1 Displacement of the running line during compressor fouling

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling. When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power.

The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit.

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.

This shows an increase during compressor fouling, as shown in Fig. 18.24, where the VIGV position increases from 72% to about 86%.

It should not be thought that compressor washing and cleaning can be deferred because of the very small loss in engine performance resulting from

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

# 18.3.1 Displacement of the running line during compressor fouling

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling. When the VIGV is active in the normal operating power.

The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit.

It is only when the maximum power demand from the gas turbine is required that the loss in power output and thermal efficiency is observed. Thus it is always necessary to clean the compressor on a regular basis if lost production and increased fuel costs are to be avoided at high-power conditions. Certainly, some delay in the washing of the compressor may occur when operating at low power; however, such wash optimisation should take into careful consideration the increased life cycle costs when maximum power output from the gas turbine is required.

Also discussed in Section 18.2.7 was the effect of compressor fouling on the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21. The compressor characteristic was fixed, due to the VIGV being fully opened, thus an approximate unique running line (describing the variation of compressor non-dimensional flow with compressor non-dimensional speed, as shown in Figures 18.11 and 18.21) is observed and the shift of this running line is affected only by compressor fouling.

Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%.

18.24 Trend in VIGV position due to compressor fouling at low power and with VIGV operation.

range, the characteristic is continuously changing, thus the running line for a clean compressor will also change. Hence, compressor fouling cannot be detected due to the shift of the running line as shown in Fig. 18.21, and there is no simple means of detecting compressor fouling for a single shaft gas turbine when the VIGV is active. In this instance, gas turbine models are

needed such as that used in building this simulator in conjunction with gas path analysis techniques to detect compressor fouling.

It should be pointed out that the compressor of the two-shaft gas turbine also uses VIGV and VSV to achieve satisfactory performance of the engine and the concept of unique running lines was applied to detect compressor fouling. In this case, the movement of the VIGV and VSV is determined by the compressor non-dimensional speed rather than by the EGT. Thus, for a given compressor non-dimensional speed, there is a unique VIGV/VSV position and this results in a unique compressor characteristic for a given compressor non-dimensional speed. Therefore, the displacement of the unique running lines can be used to detect compressor fouling for a two-shaft gas turbine and this has been discussed in Section 13.1.12.

# 18.4 Turbine damage (hot end damage) at high-power outputs

As discussed previously, turbines are exposed to high temperatures and the turbine blades are often cooled to achieve satisfactory life. Over a period of time, turbine damage may occur where the bowing and erosion of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) increases the non-dimensional flow capacity of the turbine (hot end damage). The change in incident and deflection of the gas through the turbine stages, due to damage of the turbine blades, will also affect the turbine efficiency. Turbine blade rubs also result in reduced engine performance and such damage normally affects the turbine efficiency rather than the flow capacity of the turbine. The effect of hot end damage on engine performance will be considered and the reader left to simulate the effects of turbine blade rubs on engine performance. The simulation of hot end damage is achieved by increasing the turbine fouling fault index by 3%, while decreasing the turbine efficiency fault index by 2%. On this occasion hot end damage which occurs over a 1-hour period will be simulated.

The effect of hot end damage will be considered when the engine is operating at two power output conditions. The first is at a power level such that the engine is always on an operating limit such as EGT. The second case is at reduced power, when no engine operating limit is reached during hot end damage; but the case of the VIGV being active at reduced operating power will be considered so that the EGT is maintained on the set point, which corresponds to the maximum EGT limit. The ambient pressure and temperature is set at 1.013 Bar and 15 degrees Celsius, respectively.
