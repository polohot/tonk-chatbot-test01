# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature

# 7.8 Off-design performance prediction of complex gas turbine cycles

In Chapter 3 was discussed the design point performance of complex cycles which incorporated intercooling to reduce the compressor power requirement, reheat to augment the turbine power output, and regeneration to decrease the thermal input in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the simple cycle gas turbine. Complex cycles may employ engine configurations such as multi-spooling compressors and turbines, including the use of free power turbines, as described, when discussing the methods for predicting the off-design performance of a simple cycle. These methods can also be used in predicting the off-design performance of complex cycles.

# 7.8.1 Off-design performance prediction of a single-shaft gas turbine employing an intercooler

The performance prediction of compressors, turbines and the combustion system has been discussed. The thermodynamic performance of an intercooler can be determined using the method described in Section 2.14. For an intercooler, the ratio of the thermal capacities of the heated and cooled fluid may be significantly different, and thus the ratio of thermal capacities for intercoolers could as low as 0.2. Referring to Fig. 2.18 in Chapter 2, the effectiveness of the intercooler can approach unity, particularly if water is employed as the cooling medium. This is primarily due to the higher specific heat of water compared with air, and the water flow rate through the intercooler can be greater than that of the air flow in the cooler. Thus the air temperature
