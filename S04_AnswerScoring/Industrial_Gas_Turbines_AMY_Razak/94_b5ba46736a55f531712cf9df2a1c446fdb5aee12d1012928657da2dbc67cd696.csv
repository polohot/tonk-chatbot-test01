of pressure and temperature is significant in the formation of NOₓ and it increases exponentially with these parameters. The oxides that are formed, NO and NO₂, of which NO is dominant, are usually referred to as thermal NOₓ. NOₓ is toxic and also takes part in the formation of chemical smog, and enhances the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. Another source of nitrogen for the formation of NO is from certain fuels and is often referred to as fuel-bound NOₓ.

Clearly, the formation of pollutants is dependent on the combustion pressure, temperature and mixing of the fuel and combustion air. The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher is the reaction rate resulting in lower CO and UHC, but also in an increase in NOₓ formation. The combustion pressure and temperature vary with engine load, decreasing when the load is reduced. Therefore, we observe increasing levels of CO and UHC and a decrease in the level of NOₓ with the reduction in engine load, as illustrated in Fig. 6.23.

# 6.9 NOx suppression using water and steam injection

We have stated that the formation of NOₓ is very sensitive to combustion temperature. Introducing a heat sink to reduce the combustion temperature can dramatically reduce the amount of NOₓ produced during combustion. Water is a good heat sink because of its high specific heat. Injection of water into the primary zone can significantly reduce the amount of NOₓ. For example, if we inject equal amounts of water and fuel (i.e. water to fuel ratio of 1.0) we can reduce NOₓ by some 80%.

of pressure and temperature is significant in the formation of NOₓ and it increases exponentially with these parameters. The oxides that are formed, NO and NO₂, of which NO is dominant, are usually referred to as thermal NOₓ. NOₓ is toxic and also takes part in the formation of chemical smog, and enhances the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. Another source of nitrogen for the formation of NO is from certain fuels and is often referred to as fuel-bound NOₓ.

Clearly, the formation of pollutants is dependent on the combustion pressure, temperature and mixing of the fuel and combustion air. The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher is the reaction rate resulting in lower CO and UHC, but also in an increase in NOₓ formation. The combustion pressure and temperature vary with engine load, decreasing when the load is reduced. Therefore, we observe increasing levels of CO and UHC and a decrease in the level of NOₓ with the reduction in engine load, as illustrated in Fig. 6.23.

# 6.9 NOx suppression using water and steam injection

We have stated that the formation of NOₓ is very sensitive to combustion temperature. Introducing a heat sink to reduce the combustion temperature can dramatically reduce the amount of NOₓ produced during combustion. Water is a good heat sink because of its high specific heat. Injection of water into the primary zone can significantly reduce the amount of NOₓ. For example, if we inject equal amounts of water and fuel (i.e. water to fuel ratio of 1.0) we can reduce NOₓ by some 80%.

We have stated that the formation of NOₓ is very sensitive to combustion temperature. Introducing a heat sink to reduce the combustion temperature can dramatically reduce the amount of NOₓ produced during combustion. Water is a good heat sink because of its high specific heat. Injection of water into the primary zone can significantly reduce the amount of NOₓ. For example, if we inject equal amounts of water and fuel (i.e. water to fuel ratio of 1.0) we can reduce NOₓ by some 80%.

Although water injection can dramatically reduce NOₓ it has many disadvantages. The suppression of the combustion temperature results in increased production of CO and UHC. ",Why is NOₓ formation more sensitive to combustion temperature than CO and UHC?,A4,"NOₓ's sensitivity to temperature stems from the high-temperature requirement for nitrogen to oxidize, in contrast to CO and UHC which can form under cooler conditions.",2.734375,2.90625,3.65625,1.765625,0.44921875

of pressure and temperature is significant in the formation of NOₓ and it increases exponentially with these parameters. The oxides that are formed, NO and NO₂, of which NO is dominant, are usually referred to as thermal NOₓ. NOₓ is toxic and also takes part in the formation of chemical smog, and enhances the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. Another source of nitrogen for the formation of NO is from certain fuels and is often referred to as fuel-bound NOₓ.

Clearly, the formation of pollutants is dependent on the combustion pressure, temperature and mixing of the fuel and combustion air. The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher is the reaction rate resulting in lower CO and UHC, but also in an increase in NOₓ formation. The combustion pressure and temperature vary with engine load, decreasing when the load is reduced. Therefore, we observe increasing levels of CO and UHC and a decrease in the level of NOₓ with the reduction in engine load, as illustrated in Fig. 6.23.

# 6.9 NOx suppression using water and steam injection

We have stated that the formation of NOₓ is very sensitive to combustion temperature. Introducing a heat sink to reduce the combustion temperature can dramatically reduce the amount of NOₓ produced during combustion. Water is a good heat sink because of its high specific heat. Injection of water into the primary zone can significantly reduce the amount of NOₓ. For example, if we inject equal amounts of water and fuel (i.e. water to fuel ratio of 1.0) we can reduce NOₓ by some 80%.

",Why is NOₓ formation more sensitive to combustion temperature than CO and UHC?,A5,The formation of NOₓ is more temperature-sensitive than CO and UHC due to the high activation energy required for nitrogen oxidation processes.,2.46875,2.765625,3.4375,1.75,0.27734375
