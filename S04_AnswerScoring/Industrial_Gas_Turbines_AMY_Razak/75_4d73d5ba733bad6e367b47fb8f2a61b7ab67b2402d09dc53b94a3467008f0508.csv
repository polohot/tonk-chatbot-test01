Having selected a stage loading and flow coefficient, the designer can easily estimate the stage efficiency. For instance, with a flow coefficient of 0.8 and a stage loading coefficient of 2.5, the stage efficiency can be estimated to be between 88% and 89%. There is no equivalent diagram for compressors and the stage-loading coefficient for compressors as stated in Chapter 4 should be kept below 0.5 (subsonic compressors). Industrial engines may use low stage loading and flow coefficients in order to achieve high stage efficiency. Aero-derived gas turbines may use higher values in order to keep the weight and frontal area down.

From Equation 5.9 it is observed that the stage work done will increase as the rotor deflection (β1 + β2), axial velocity, Ca, and blade velocity, U, increase. Increasing one or more of these parameters will result in a smaller number of stages to achieve a given overall turbine pressure ratio and thus power output.

Having selected a stage loading and flow coefficient, the designer can easily estimate the stage efficiency. For instance, with a flow coefficient of 0.8 and a stage loading coefficient of 2.5, the stage efficiency can be estimated to be between 88% and 89%. There is no equivalent diagram for compressors and the stage-loading coefficient for compressors as stated in Chapter 4 should be kept below 0.5 (subsonic compressors). Industrial engines may use low stage loading and flow coefficients in order to achieve high stage efficiency. Aero-derived gas turbines may use higher values in order to keep the weight and frontal area down.

From Equation 5.9 it is observed that the stage work done will increase as the rotor deflection (β1 + β2), axial velocity, Ca, and blade velocity, U, increase. Increasing one or more of these parameters will result in a smaller number of stages to achieve a given overall turbine pressure ratio and thus power output.

Having selected a stage loading and flow coefficient, the designer can easily estimate the stage efficiency. For instance, with a flow coefficient of 0.8 and a stage loading coefficient of 2.5, the stage efficiency can be estimated to be between 88% and 89%. There is no equivalent diagram for compressors and the stage-loading coefficient for compressors as stated in Chapter 4 should be kept below 0.5 (subsonic compressors). Industrial engines may use low stage loading and flow coefficients in order to achieve high stage efficiency. Aero-derived gas turbines may use higher values in order to keep the weight and frontal area down.

From Equation 5.9 it is observed that the stage work done will increase as the rotor deflection (β1 + β2), axial velocity, Ca, and blade velocity, U, increase. Increasing one or more of these parameters will result in a smaller number of stages to achieve a given overall turbine pressure ratio and thus power output.
