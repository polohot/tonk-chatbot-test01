Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in turbine creep life

The trends in turbine creep life due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. 13.33. It is interesting to note that the gas generator turbine creep life usage actually decreases due to this deterioration. The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.

Figure 13.33 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life due to gas generator turbine hot end damage.

The gas generator turbine life usage due to this deterioration. However, this decrease in turbine creep life usage is very misleading. To obtain the complete picture the simulator needs to be run at the maximum power available when hot end damage is present and with no performance deterioration (i.e. at a generator power of 18.8 MW). The gas generator turbine time to overhaul would then be observed increasing to about 55 500 hours. Thus, hot end damage actually results in a loss in gas generator turbine creep life.

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in turbine creep life

The trends in turbine creep life due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. 13.33. It is interesting to note that the gas generator turbine creep life usage actually decreases due to this deterioration. The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.

Figure 13.33 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life due to gas generator turbine hot end damage.

The gas generator turbine life usage due to this deterioration. However, this decrease in turbine creep life usage is very misleading. To obtain the complete picture the simulator needs to be run at the maximum power available when hot end damage is present and with no performance deterioration (i.e. at a generator power of 18.8 MW). The gas generator turbine time to overhaul would then be observed increasing to about 55 500 hours. Thus, hot end damage actually results in a loss in gas generator turbine creep life.

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage.

Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in turbine creep life

The trends in turbine creep life due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. 13.33. It is interesting to note that the gas generator turbine creep life usage actually decreases due to this deterioration. The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.

Figure 13.33 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life due to gas generator turbine hot end damage.

The gas generator turbine life usage due to this deterioration. However, this decrease in turbine creep life usage is very misleading. To obtain the complete picture the simulator needs to be run at the maximum power available when hot end damage is present and with no performance deterioration (i.e. at a generator power of 18.8 MW). The gas generator turbine time to overhaul would then be observed increasing to about 55 500 hours. Thus, hot end damage actually results in a loss in gas generator turbine creep life.

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

The trends in turbine creep life due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. 13.33. It is interesting to note that the gas generator turbine creep life usage actually decreases due to this deterioration. The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.

The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.

Figure 13.33 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life due to gas generator turbine hot end damage.

The gas generator turbine life usage due to this deterioration. However, this decrease in turbine creep life usage is very misleading. To obtain the complete picture the simulator needs to be run at the maximum power available when hot end damage is present and with no performance deterioration (i.e. at a generator power of 18.8 MW). The gas generator turbine time to overhaul would then be observed increasing to about 55 500 hours. Thus, hot end damage actually results in a loss in gas generator turbine creep life.

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

Turbine deterioration is present, to determine the actual effect of hot end damage on the power turbine creep life usage. Then a decrease in creep life usage would be seen, thus indicating the negative impact on power turbine creep life due to hot end damage. The user is left to demonstrate this difference in creep life.

(If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in turbine creep life

The trends in turbine creep life due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. 13.33. It is interesting to note that the gas generator turbine creep life usage actually decreases due to this deterioration. The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.

Figure 13.33 Trends in gas generator and power turbine creep life due to gas generator turbine hot end damage.

The gas generator turbine life usage due to this deterioration. However, this decrease in turbine creep life usage is very misleading. To obtain the complete picture the simulator needs to be run at the maximum power available when hot end damage is present and with no performance deterioration (i.e. at a generator power of 18.8 MW). The gas generator turbine time to overhaul would then be observed increasing to about 55 500 hours. Thus, hot end damage actually results in a loss in gas generator turbine creep life.

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

Figure 13.33 also shows the trend in the power turbine creep life. Observe that the power turbine creep life usage increases during the period when hot end damage to the gas generator turbines first occurs. The power turbine creep life usage is observed to decrease apparently above that before hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine. This is due to the transient as the control system responds by closing the fuel valve, hence reducing the fuel flow, in an attempt to keep the exhaust gas temperature within the control limits. This action results in a slight over-shoot of the exhaust gas temperature, as seen in Fig. 13.30, and results in the increased power turbine creep life usage during the transient. If the hot end damage was applied to the gas generator turbine over a longer time period, greater than 500 seconds, a continuous decrease in the power turbine creep life usage would be observed. This decrease in power turbine creep life usage occurs mainly due to the reduction in power output from the power turbine resulting in lower stress in the power turbine blades.

Again, this increase in power turbine life is misleading. The simulator needs to be run at the limiting power due to hot end damage, but when no

# Simulating the effects of engine component deterioration

Turbine deterioration is present, to determine the actual effect of hot end damage on the power turbine creep life usage. Then a decrease in creep life usage would be seen, thus indicating the negative impact on power turbine creep life due to hot end damage. The user is left to demonstrate this difference in creep life.

Although the gas turbine thermal efficiency decreases, the loss in power output is greater than the loss in gas turbine thermal efficiency and therefore a reduction in fuel flow is observed. (If the simulator is run at low power level such that the engine is not on an operating limit, an increase in fuel flow would then be observed for the same turbine deterioration.)

The decrease in the compressor inlet airflow and thus the combustion airflow is similar to the decrease in fuel flow. Furthermore, the combustion temperature rise remains essentially unchanged before and after hot end damage (Fig. 13.30). Thus, only a slight change in the air–fuel ratio is observed due to hot end damage in the gas generator turbine.

# Trends in turbine creep life

The trends in turbine creep life due to hot end damage are shown in Fig. 13.33. It is interesting to note that the gas generator turbine creep life usage actually decreases due to this deterioration. The time to overhaul for the gas generator turbine increases from about 22,000 hours to 45,000 hours. In the above figures it has been observed that the gas generator speed and turbine entry temperature decrease due to hot end damage, resulting in lower stress and blade temperature during hot end damage. These factors therefore decrease.
