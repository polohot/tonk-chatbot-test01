where T is the temperature at the start of compression and expansion, Prₒ is the pressure ratio of the compression and expansion processes and R is the gas constant of the fluid being compressed or expanded, which is usually air.

From the steady flow energy equation:

Q – W = cₚ(T₂ – T₁)

For an ideal isothermal process, T₂ = T₁.

An expression for the specific work for an ideal isothermal compression and expansion can be derived from the equations:

W = ∫ p v d [3.24]

and

pv = c [3.25]

where p is pressure, v is specific volume, and c is constant to give
