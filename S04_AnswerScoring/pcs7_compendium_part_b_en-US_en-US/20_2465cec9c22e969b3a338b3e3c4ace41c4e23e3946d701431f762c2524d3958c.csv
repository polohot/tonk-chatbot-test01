# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.
