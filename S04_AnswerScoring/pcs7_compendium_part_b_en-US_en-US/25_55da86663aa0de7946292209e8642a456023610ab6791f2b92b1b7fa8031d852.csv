The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

",What is the purpose of activating the light test in the module described in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,A3,"To achieve safety standards like SIL3/Kat.4/PLe, the light test must be activated when the output is not active in the 'good condition'.",1.8046875,2.0,3.46875,1.46875,0.5703125

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module can only be used in safety mode, not redundantly. For the purpose of switching an actuator, each module is provided with one switch in the plus line (P switch) and one in the minus line (M switch). An actuator must be connected between the P and M switches to enable the module to be used for safety applications up to SIL 3.

Diagnostic interrupt: The diagnostic interrupt for the F signal module must always be activated in safety mode.

Activated: Activates channel processing

Diagnostics: Wire break: Activates wire-break monitoring on the channel

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.

# Type of sensor interconnection (analog inputs)

When safety mode is activated 1 or 2 sensors can be configured per input channel. Discrepancy handling can be set accordingly.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module can only be used in safety mode, not redundantly. For the purpose of switching an actuator, each module is provided with one switch in the plus line (P switch) and one in the minus line (M switch). An actuator must be connected between the P and M switches to enable the module to be used for safety applications up to SIL 3.

Diagnostic interrupt: The diagnostic interrupt for the F signal module must always be activated in safety mode.

Activated: Activates channel processing

Diagnostics: Wire break: Activates wire-break monitoring on the channel

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms.
