# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max. ",How can the maximum F-cycle time be modified in the F_CYC_CO block?,A1,Modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block within the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart.,1.859375,2.046875,3.46875,1.4921875,0.29296875

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

Note

You can find additional information on ""CPU_RT"" in the section ""Family: @System"" of the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Basic Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109738089) manual.

# 7.11.2 Calculating the F-cycle monitoring time (for block F_CYC_CO)

The F-CPU runs execution time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB (OB 30 - OB 38) containing F-runtime groups.

CrC_ C337

YX CYC FRILED @@F_ShutOn (4,1} !CR_CB37 INI

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max. ",What does the F-CPU monitor for cyclic interrupt OBs containing F-runtime groups?,A2,Execution time monitoring is performed by the F-CPU on cyclic interrupt OBs (OB30-OB38) with F-runtime groups.,2.390625,2.28125,3.390625,1.46875,0.55859375

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.

# 7.11.2 Calculating the F-cycle monitoring time (for block F_CYC_CO)

The F-CPU runs execution time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB (OB 30 - OB 38) containing F-runtime groups.

CrC_ C337

ingerted 41

YX CYC FRILED @@F_ShutOn (4,1} !CR_CB37 INI

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max. ",What happens if the default maximum cycle time is not suitable for a process?,A3,Process requirements can be met by changing the MAX_CYC setting in the F_CYC_CO block found in the @F_CycCo-OB3x chart.,2.390625,2.46875,3.5625,1.5390625,0.546875

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max.

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.

# 7.11.2 Calculating the F-cycle monitoring time (for block F_CYC_CO)

The F-CPU runs execution time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB (OB 30 - OB 38) containing F-runtime groups.

YX CYC FRILED @@F_ShutOn (4,1} !CR_CB37 INI

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max. ",What is the significance of the OBxx_ATT input in the 'CPU_RT' block?,A5,This input's setting ('0' for disable) is crucial for managing interrupt OB calls and avoiding safety program disruptions.,2.21875,2.203125,3.546875,1.5078125,0.54296875

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.

Note

You can find additional information on ""CPU_RT"" in the section ""Family: @System"" of the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Basic Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109738089) manual.

# 7.11.2 Calculating the F-cycle monitoring time (for block F_CYC_CO)

The F-CPU runs execution time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB (OB 30 - OB 38) containing F-runtime groups.

F_CrC_CC-0337

CrC_ C337

ingerted 41

YX CYC FRILED @@F_ShutOn (4,1} !CR_CB37 INI

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F_CYC_CO F-function block is called.
- TP15: Configured ""max. ",What parameters are needed to calculate the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB?,A1,"TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB, and TP15: Configured 'max.' parameter.",2.125,2.203125,3.578125,1.6484375,0.4765625

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).
