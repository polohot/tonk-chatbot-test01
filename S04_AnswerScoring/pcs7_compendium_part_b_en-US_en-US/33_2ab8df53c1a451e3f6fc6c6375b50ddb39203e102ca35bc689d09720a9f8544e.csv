# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

For each additional HART command with a set SHC bit, the electronic module reserves the HART command processing for this channel again for a further 2 s. If a HART command is recognized for this channel without a set SHC bit, or if no further command for this channel arrives within 2 seconds after the previous HART command, the electronic module returns to ""normal"" HART command processing. Result: All HART channels are re-processed.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

If a HART command is recognized for this channel without a set SHC bit, or if no further command for this channel arrives within 2 seconds after the previous HART command, the electronic module returns to ""normal"" HART command processing. Result: All HART channels are re-processed.

- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

# Procedure

1. In HW Config, configure both F signal modules in the ET 200M stations.
2. Configure the first F signal module:
- Activate ""Safety mode"" in the ""Parameters"" tab.
3. Configure the second F signal module:
- Activate ""Safety mode"" in the ""Parameters"" tab.
4. For the second F signal module, select ""2 modules"" mode in the ""Redundancy"" tab.
5. In the ""Find redundant module"" dialog for the F signal module, select the redundant F signal module.
6. Set further parameters as necessary. The settings are applied automatically for the redundant F signal module. As soon as two F signal modules are redundant, changes to the parameter settings for one of them will automatically be applied for the other.
7. Check the default discrepancy time for redundant, fail-safe digital input modules.

If you are operating a HART device on a channel of a redundant module, you also need to follow the steps outlined below:

1. In both modules, configure a ""HART field device"" on the relevant channel.

For each additional HART command with a set SHC bit, the electronic module reserves the HART command processing for this channel again for a further 2 s. If a HART command is recognized for this channel without a set SHC bit, or if no further command for this channel arrives within 2 seconds after the previous HART command, the electronic module returns to ""normal"" HART command processing. Result: All HART channels are re-processed.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1.
