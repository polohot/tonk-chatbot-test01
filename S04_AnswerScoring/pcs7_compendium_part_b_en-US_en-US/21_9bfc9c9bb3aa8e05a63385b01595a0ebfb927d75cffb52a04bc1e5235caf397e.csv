Where ""1oo1 evaluation"" is concerned, the value displayed is not relevant. The discrepancy analysis for equivalence/non-equivalence is used for fail-safe inputs in order to detect errors from the temporal characteristic of two signals with identical functionality.

The discrepancy analysis is started whenever different levels (when testing for non-equivalence: the same level) are detected on two associated input signals.
