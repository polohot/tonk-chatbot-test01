# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Procedure

To download the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Entire program"" in the CFC editor. This will set the F CPU to STOP.

To download changes made to the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Changes"" in the CFC editor. Depending on the CFC editor version you are working with, you may need to deactivate safety mode in the SIMATIC Manager before this process takes place and reactivate it afterwards. Alternatively, a prompt may be issued in CFC offering you the option of deactivating safety mode directly and reactivating it after downloading has taken place.

Note

Before the safety program is downloaded you will be prompted to enter the CPU password if changes are detected in the fail-safe part of the program.

Once you have downloaded the program to the CPU, you will need to compare this program's collective signature with the collective signature in the acceptance-tested printout. On S7 F/FH systems, you need to run this comparison for both CPUs.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Procedure

To download the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Entire program"" in the CFC editor. This will set the F CPU to STOP.

To download changes made to the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Changes"" in the CFC editor. Depending on the CFC editor version you are working with, you may need to deactivate safety mode in the SIMATIC Manager before this process takes place and reactivate it afterwards. Alternatively, a prompt may be issued in CFC offering you the option of deactivating safety mode directly and reactivating it after downloading has taken place.

Note

Before the safety program is downloaded you will be prompted to enter the CPU password if changes are detected in the fail-safe part of the program.

Once you have downloaded the program to the CPU, you will need to compare this program's collective signature with the collective signature in the acceptance-tested printout. On S7 F/FH systems, you need to run this comparison for both CPUs.

Once you have downloaded the program to the CPU, you will need to compare this program's collective signature with the collective signature in the acceptance-tested printout. On S7 F/FH systems, you need to run this comparison for both CPUs.

# Procedure

To download the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Entire program"" in the CFC editor. This will set the F CPU to STOP.

To download changes made to the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Changes"" in the CFC editor. Depending on the CFC editor version you are working with, you may need to deactivate safety mode in the SIMATIC Manager before this process takes place and reactivate it afterwards. Alternatively, a prompt may be issued in CFC offering you the option of deactivating safety mode directly and reactivating it after downloading has taken place.

Note

Before the safety program is downloaded you will be prompted to enter the CPU password if changes are detected in the fail-safe part of the program.

Once you have downloaded the program to the CPU, you will need to compare this program's collective signature with the collective signature in the acceptance-tested printout. On S7 F/FH systems, you need to run this comparison for both CPUs.

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Changes to fail-safe parameters of a PCS 7 OS can be made using the following functions:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Procedure

To download the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Entire program"" in the CFC editor. This will set the F CPU to STOP.

To download changes made to the safety program, select the menu command ""CPU > Download > Changes"" in the CFC editor. Depending on the CFC editor version you are working with, you may need to deactivate safety mode in the SIMATIC Manager before this process takes place and reactivate it afterwards. Alternatively, a prompt may be issued in CFC offering you the option of deactivating safety mode directly and reactivating it after downloading has taken place.

Note

Before the safety program is downloaded you will be prompted to enter the CPU password if changes are detected in the fail-safe part of the program.

Once you have downloaded the program to the CPU, you will need to compare this program's collective signature with the collective signature in the acceptance-tested printout. On S7 F/FH systems, you need to run this comparison for both CPUs.

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Changes to fail-safe parameters of a PCS 7 OS can be made using the following functions:
