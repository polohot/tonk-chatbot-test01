# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0"").

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset.

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0""). When the operation is locked, all activated signals are reset. ",How does the SWC_CHG function operate according to the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,A1,"The SWC_CHG function allows changing an F Bool or F Real value in the safety program, depending on whether an F_SWC_CB or F_SWC_CR block is used.",1.7421875,1.7890625,3.46875,1.8203125,0.47265625

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0"").

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0"").
