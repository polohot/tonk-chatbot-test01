# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.1 Operating mode

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

The settings for communication modules are explained in Compendium Part A. It may be advisable to operate the F-I/O on a separate DP master system when there are numerous nodes or nodes with low transmission speeds.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# Requirements for using PROFINET with S7 F Systems

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.1 Operating mode

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

The settings for communication modules are explained in Compendium Part A. It may be advisable to operate the F-I/O on a separate DP master system when there are numerous nodes or nodes with low transmission speeds.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# Requirements for using PROFINET with S7 F Systems

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

- Runtime of cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program

Defaults from the process (monitoring times) and the current configuration (bus parameters, number and type of DP slaves, etc.) are also used in the calculation.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.1 Operating mode

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# Requirements for using PROFINET with S7 F Systems

PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Calculation

You can use this dialog to calculate monitoring times for updating the standby CPU. You need to enter information about your user program for this purpose:

- Runtime of cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program

Defaults from the process (monitoring times) and the current configuration (bus parameters, number and type of DP slaves, etc.) are also used in the calculation.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.1 Operating mode

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

# 6.3 Communications module parameters/Networks

The settings for communication modules are explained in Compendium Part A. It may be advisable to operate the F-I/O on a separate DP master system when there are numerous nodes or nodes with low transmission speeds.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

For more information and remedies, refer to the following manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/82478488)""

# 6.3 Communications module parameters/Networks

The settings for communication modules are explained in Compendium Part A. It may be advisable to operate the F-I/O on a separate DP master system when there are numerous nodes or nodes with low transmission speeds.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# Requirements for using PROFINET with S7 F Systems

PROFIsafe version V2, which is required for fail-safe communication via PROFINET, is available in S7 F Systems as of V6.0. The following components are required to use PROFINET with S7 F Systems:

# Recommended software requirements:

- PCS 7 V8.0 SP2 or higher
- S7 F Systems V6.1 SP1 or higher
- As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3
- S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP11 or higher

# Hardware requirements:

- CPU (CPU 412-5H, CPU 414-5H, CPU 416-5H, CPU 417-5H or CPU 410, CPU 410E)
- I/O modules:
- SM 326F, DI 24xDC24V (6ES7 326-1BK02-0AB0)
- SM 326F, DO 10xDC24V/2A, P-switching (6ES7 326-2BF10-0AB0)
- SM 326F, DO 8xDC24V/2A, P-M-switching (6ES7 326-2BF41-0AB0)
- SM 336F, AI 6x0/4...20mA HART (6ES7 336-4GE00-0AB0)

Note: Before you use the fail-safe devices make sure that they support PROFIsafe V2 mode (F_Par_Version = 1) on PROFINET IO as well as in the downstream networks (PROFINET IO or PROFIBUS DP). The set PROFIsafe mode of the device is documented in the hardware printout.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.1 Operating mode

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# DIP switch settings

The DIP switch setting is the binary representation of the F_DEST_ADD. It must be set on the F signal module DIP switches before you install the F signal module.

|Standard mode|Safety mode|
|---|---|
|3 832888382C|3 833388382C|
|All possible combinations that do not correspond to standard mode|All possible combinations that do not correspond to standard mode|

|Module start address 192 corresponds to|F_DEST_ADD 24|
|3 832888382C| |

When these modules are in standard mode, F_DEST_ADD is always set to ""0"" (delivery condition).

In the case of older module versions, the F_DEST_ADD is dependent on the module start address.
