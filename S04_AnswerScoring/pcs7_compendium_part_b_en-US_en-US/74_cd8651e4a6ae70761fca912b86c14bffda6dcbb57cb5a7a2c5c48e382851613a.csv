There are 2 different variants:

- One F-shutdown group is present in the signal flow being examined.
- Two F-shutdown groups are present in the signal flow being examined.

You will need the following parameters for the calculation:

|TCI/TCI1/TCI2|Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F-function block has been installed in each case|
|---|---|
|TCImax.proj. / TCImax.proj.1 / TCImax.proj.2|Time set in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F-function block (xx = Number of corresponding cyclic interrupt OB).|

|TIMEOUT|Time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the F_R_BO or F_R_R block|

# CPU-to-CPU communication (optional)

If your signal is transferred from one CPU to another, select ""Yes"" in the header. For calculation purposes, you require the time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the send and receive blocks for communication.

If CPU-to-CPU communication is not taking place, leave the default setting (""No"") unchanged. The next section, ""Processing in the 2nd CPU"", will not be taken into account during calculation in this case.

|---|---|
|TCImax.proj. / TCImax.proj.1 / TCImax.proj.2|Time set in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F-function block (xx = Number of corresponding cyclic interrupt OB).|
|TFPROG/TFPROG1/TFPROG2|Program runtime of the corresponding cyclic interrupt OB|
|TIMEOUT|Time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the F_R_BO or F_R_R block|

# CPU-to-CPU communication (optional)

If your signal is transferred from one CPU to another, select ""Yes"" in the header. For calculation purposes, you require the time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the send and receive blocks for communication.

If CPU-to-CPU communication is not taking place, leave the default setting (""No"") unchanged. The next section, ""Processing in the 2nd CPU"", will not be taken into account during calculation in this case.

Note

You can find information on creating and configuring a Safety Matrix in the ""SIMATIC Industrial Software Safety Matrix"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/100675874) manual.

# Versioning

A Safety Matrix is determined by its version number, file version, and signature. ",Where can one find information on creating and configuring a Safety Matrix according to the text?,A2,"The manual 'SIMATIC Industrial Software Safety Matrix' provides the needed information, accessible online.",2.15625,2.34375,3.578125,1.09375,0.455078125

There are 2 different variants:

- One F-shutdown group is present in the signal flow being examined.
- Two F-shutdown groups are present in the signal flow being examined.

You will need the following parameters for the calculation:

|TCI/TCI1/TCI2|Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F-function block has been installed in each case|
|---|---|
|TCImax.proj. / TCImax.proj.1 / TCImax.proj.2|Time set in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F-function block (xx = Number of corresponding cyclic interrupt OB).|
|TFPROG/TFPROG1/TFPROG2|Program runtime of the corresponding cyclic interrupt OB|
|TIMEOUT|Time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the F_R_BO or F_R_R block|

# CPU-to-CPU communication (optional)

If your signal is transferred from one CPU to another, select ""Yes"" in the header. For calculation purposes, you require the time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the send and receive blocks for communication.

If CPU-to-CPU communication is not taking place, leave the default setting (""No"") unchanged. The next section, ""Processing in the 2nd CPU"", will not be taken into account during calculation in this case.

# Result

S7ftime.xls returns two groups each with 3 times.

|---|---|---|
| |if there is a fault/error|1748 ms|
