# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

# 6.1.5 H parameters

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.
