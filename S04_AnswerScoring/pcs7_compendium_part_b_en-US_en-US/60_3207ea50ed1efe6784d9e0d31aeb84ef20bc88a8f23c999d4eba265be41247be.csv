This sheet contains formulae for calculating minimum values:

- MAX_CYC - Maximum time between 2 calls of the cyclic interrupt OB with F-program
- PROFIsafe monitoring time - Maximum time between 2 frames from the master to the F-I/O.
- TIMEOUT between F-shutdown groups - Timeout value for fail-safe communication between F-shutdown groups in an F-CPU
- TIMEOUT between F-CPUs - Timeout value for fail-safe communication between two F-CPUs
- Max. response times
You can use this to determine the maximum runtime of a signal from an input to an output in the system, with various types of configuration taken into account.
