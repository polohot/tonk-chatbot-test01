Maintenance Override gives you the option to set bypasses in the safety program from the OS as well as the safety-oriented changing of F-parameters in the safety program of an F-CPU from an OS.

A special safety protocol is used to make changes to F-parameters in safety mode. This meets Safety Integrity Level requirements up to SIL3 in accordance with IEC 61508.

S7 F-systems offers the following for MOS:

- Four F-blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_R: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_MOS: Interface for the display of the MOS function on the OS.
- A template for the temporal limitation of the change (SWC_TR)
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

# 7.10.3 Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

Maintenance Override gives you the option to set bypasses in the safety program from the OS as well as the safety-oriented changing of F-parameters in the safety program of an F-CPU from an OS.

A special safety protocol is used to make changes to F-parameters in safety mode. This meets Safety Integrity Level requirements up to SIL3 in accordance with IEC 61508.

S7 F-systems offers the following for MOS:

- Four F-blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_R: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_MOS: Interface for the display of the MOS function on the OS.
- A template for the temporal limitation of the change (SWC_TR)
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

Maintenance Override gives you the option to set bypasses in the safety program from the OS as well as the safety-oriented changing of F-parameters in the safety program of an F-CPU from an OS.

A special safety protocol is used to make changes to F-parameters in safety mode. This meets Safety Integrity Level requirements up to SIL3 in accordance with IEC 61508.

S7 F-systems offers the following for MOS:

- Four F-blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_R: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_MOS: Interface for the display of the MOS function on the OS.
- A template for the temporal limitation of the change (SWC_TR)
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

You can use MOS to modify an F-parameter in the safety program of an F-CPU if you perform a specific sequence of operations on the OS within a specified period of time. The entire change operation is known as a ""transaction"".

# 7.10.3 Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

Maintenance Override gives you the option to set bypasses in the safety program from the OS as well as the safety-oriented changing of F-parameters in the safety program of an F-CPU from an OS.

A special safety protocol is used to make changes to F-parameters in safety mode. This meets Safety Integrity Level requirements up to SIL3 in accordance with IEC 61508.

S7 F-systems offers the following for MOS:

- Four F-blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_R: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_MOS: Interface for the display of the MOS function on the OS.
- A template for the temporal limitation of the change (SWC_TR)
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.
