# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

The F-monitoring time must be calculated for the relevant variant of each F-signal module type or each device, and the values for the cyclic interrupt OB must be calculated as well. To do this, select the appropriate configuration variant and enter the parameters in the corresponding line.

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

|monitoring time (ms)|2500|

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

- TDAT: Maximum acknowledgment time of the fail-safe I/O module in safety mode (F signal module group data sheet)
- With inputs and outputs: If you are using F-signal modules with inputs and outputs, set ""Yes"" here (e.g. ET 200pro). If you are using an ET 200M, set ""No"".
- TDP_FD: Maximum DP error detection time. Only relevant for redundant IM 153-2 (switched I/O). Enter 0 if you are not using a redundant IM.
- TDP_SO: Maximum DP switchover time. Only relevant for redundant IM 153-2 (switched I/O). Enter 0 if you are not using a redundant IM.
- TSLAVE_SO: Max. switchover time of the slaves. Only relevant for redundant IM 153-2 (switched I/O).
