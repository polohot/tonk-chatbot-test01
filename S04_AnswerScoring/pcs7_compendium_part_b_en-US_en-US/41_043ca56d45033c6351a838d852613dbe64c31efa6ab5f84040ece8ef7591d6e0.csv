Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

If passivation was triggered by setting PASS_ON = 1, user acknowledgment will not be required for reintegration.

Note

The ACK_NEC input can only be set to 0 if the process permits automatic reintegration from a safety-related point of view.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

|Remaining validity (in minutes):| | |
|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

Note

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

|Remaining validity (in minutes):| | |
|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# 7.8.3 Compiling the S7 program

During compilation, the S7 program is automatically expanded to include diagnostics drivers (contained in the @ system charts) and F-specific parts. F system blocks are stored in @F_xxxx charts.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

Check whether this setting is suitable for your process. Change the default if necessary.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# 7.8.3 Compiling the S7 program

During compilation, the S7 program is automatically expanded to include diagnostics drivers (contained in the @ system charts) and F-specific parts. F system blocks are stored in @F_xxxx charts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

If you change the shutdown behavior, you must recompile the F program. This applies even if you have changed the shutdown behavior online in CFC.

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

- ""Acc. to parameter assignment at F_SHUTDN"": Block F_SHUTDN is located in the @F_ShutDn chart. At the SHUTDOWN input, you can choose from:
- ""Partial"": The faulty F-shutdown group(s) is (are) shut down the first time an error is detected in an F-shutdown group (partial shutdown).
- ""Full"":

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

You can use the ""Shutdown behavior"" dialog to select how the safety program should behave when an error is detected (in other words, in the event of an F-STOP):

- ""Complete shutdown"": All F-shutdown groups associated with a safety program are shut down the first time an error is detected in an F-shutdown group.
- ""Acc. to parameter assignment at F_SHUTDN"": Block F_SHUTDN is located in the @F_ShutDn chart. At the SHUTDOWN input, you can choose from:
- ""Partial"": The faulty F-shutdown group(s) is (are) shut down the first time an error is detected in an F-shutdown group (partial shutdown).
- ""Full"":

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

- First, the F-shutdown group in which the error was detected is shut down.
- All other F-shutdown groups are then shut down within double the time period you set as the F monitoring time for the slowest cyclic interrupt OB.

# 7.4.2 Partial shutdown

Only the F-shutdown group in which the error was detected is shut down.

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

When F shutdown groups are shut down:

- The outputs of the F signal modules driven by the F shutdown group are passivated.
- As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3: The F channel drivers of the F shutdown group set the outputs QBAD to ""1"" and QUALITY to ""0"".
- Safety-related communication between the F shutdown group and other F CPUs is interrupted.
- Data exchange between the F shutdown group and other F shutdown groups is interrupted.
- Where data exchange between the safety program and the standard user program is concerned, the standard user program is supplied with the last valid values.
- Block F_SHUTDN generates messages which are displayed automatically on the PCS 7 OS. With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, the messages have the following message text:
- Safety program: Partial shutdown
- Safety program: Complete shutdown
- The corresponding diagnostics events are written to the F CPU's diagnostics buffer.

# 7.4.1 Complete shutdown

All of the F-CPU's F-shutdown groups are shut down. Shutdown proceeds in the following order:

- First, the F-shutdown group in which the error was detected is shut down.
- All other F-shutdown groups are then shut down within double the time period you set as the F monitoring time for the slowest cyclic interrupt OB.

# 7.4.2 Partial shutdown

Only the F-shutdown group in which the error was detected is shut down.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

Note

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

|Remaining validity (in minutes):| | |
|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Check whether this setting is suitable for your process. Change the default if necessary.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# 7.8.3 Compiling the S7 program

During compilation, the S7 program is automatically expanded to include diagnostics drivers (contained in the @ system charts) and F-specific parts. F system blocks are stored in @F_xxxx charts.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

|Remaining validity (in minutes):| | |
|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Check whether this setting is suitable for your process. Change the default if necessary.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# 7.8.3 Compiling the S7 program

During compilation, the S7 program is automatically expanded to include diagnostics drivers (contained in the @ system charts) and F-specific parts. F system blocks are stored in @F_xxxx charts.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Safety program|FSustems|Compilation|
|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

Check whether this setting is suitable for your process. Change the default if necessary.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# 7.8.3 Compiling the S7 program

During compilation, the S7 program is automatically expanded to include diagnostics drivers (contained in the @ system charts) and F-specific parts. F system blocks are stored in @F_xxxx charts.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

If you change the shutdown behavior, you must recompile the F program. This applies even if you have changed the shutdown behavior online in CFC.

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

- ""Acc. to parameter assignment at F_SHUTDN"": Block F_SHUTDN is located in the @F_ShutDn chart. At the SHUTDOWN input, you can choose from:
- ""Partial"": The faulty F-shutdown group(s) is (are) shut down the first time an error is detected in an F-shutdown group (partial shutdown).
- ""Full"":

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.
