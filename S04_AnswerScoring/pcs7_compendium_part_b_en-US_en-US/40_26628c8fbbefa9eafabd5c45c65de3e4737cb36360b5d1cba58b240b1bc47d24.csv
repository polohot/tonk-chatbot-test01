Note

If the S7 connections between the automation systems have been changed, the safety program will need to be recompiled. User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following PROFIsafe communication errors (ACK_REQ output set).

Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the send and receive blocks with the same calculated timeout value.
Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a communication fault. Communication is established internally in both directions (sending and receiving) for the F-communication. Keep in the mind the maximum communication load of the AS.

If the maximum communications load of a system is 100 requests per second, for example, this results in a total of 20 communications requests with 5 F_RECVX and 5 F_SENDX-B blocks. If these are configured in OB 37 (1 s), this corresponds to a communication load of 20%. These blocks, which are integrated into OB 38 (300 ms), correspond to a communication load of 66%.
