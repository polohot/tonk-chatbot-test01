- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms

- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms

- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms

# Explanations:

- 1) Internal processing time dependent on parameter assignment – see above table ""Internal processing time of the EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR based on parameter assignment""
- 2) Response time dependent on the sensor supply test parameter:
- - • Deactivated: For the times within the bracket terms zero values are to be inserted
- • Activated: For the times within the bracket terms the values from assigned parameters are to be inserted

3) Response time is based on the sensor supply parameter at 1oo2 (2v2):

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + 2 x {(time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))}

- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + 2 x {(time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))}
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + 2x{(10 ms + 100 ms) + (0)} = 671 ms

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + 2 x {(time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))}

# Explanations:

- 1) Internal processing time dependent on parameter assignment – see above table ""Internal processing time of the EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR based on parameter assignment""
- 2) Response time dependent on the sensor supply test parameter:
- - • Deactivated: For the times within the bracket terms zero values are to be inserted
- • Activated: For the times within the bracket terms the values from assigned parameters are to be inserted

3) Response time is based on the sensor supply parameter at 1oo2 (2v2):

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + 2 x {(time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))}
