# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.
