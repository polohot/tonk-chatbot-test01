# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# 7.10.5 Operator authorizations for Secure Write Command

Operation with the Secure Write Command functions consists of a two-step action sequence. In the first operating step, the ""Initiator"" initiates the change, after which the ""Confirmer"" checks and confirms the change in the second operating step. These steps can be performed by either a single operator or two different operators. The ""User Administrator"" in WinCC Explorer is used to assign operator authorizations for the user(s).

The default operator authorizations correspond to the user hierarchies from PCS 7:

- Initiator No.5, ""Process operations""
- Confirmer: No. 6, ""Higher-order process control"".

These required operating authorizations can be adapted to the specific project.

# Adapting the operator authorizations using SWC_QOS as an example

The required operating authorizations can be adapted in the properties of the block icon in the Graphics Designer. The procedure for changing the ""LevelInitiate"" and ""LevelConfirm"" operator authorizations is described below using SWC_QOS as an example:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# 7.10.5 Operator authorizations for Secure Write Command

Operation with the Secure Write Command functions consists of a two-step action sequence. In the first operating step, the ""Initiator"" initiates the change, after which the ""Confirmer"" checks and confirms the change in the second operating step. These steps can be performed by either a single operator or two different operators. The ""User Administrator"" in WinCC Explorer is used to assign operator authorizations for the user(s).

The default operator authorizations correspond to the user hierarchies from PCS 7:

- Initiator No.5, ""Process operations""
- Confirmer: No. 6, ""Higher-order process control"".

These required operating authorizations can be adapted to the specific project.

# Adapting the operator authorizations using SWC_QOS as an example

The required operating authorizations can be adapted in the properties of the block icon in the Graphics Designer. The procedure for changing the ""LevelInitiate"" and ""LevelConfirm"" operator authorizations is described below using SWC_QOS as an example:

Check and test the safety program after migration. After successful migration, download to the CPU is only possible in STOP mode. Once the CFCs have been migrated, the program must be compiled again. Since the migration affects the signature of the safety program, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.
