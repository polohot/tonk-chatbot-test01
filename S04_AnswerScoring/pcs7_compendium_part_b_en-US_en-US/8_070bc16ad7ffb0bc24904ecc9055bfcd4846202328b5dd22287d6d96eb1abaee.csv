Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.

# Requirement

The SIMATIC Logon Service V1.3 SP1 or higher is installed.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.

# Requirement

The SIMATIC Logon Service V1.3 SP1 or higher is installed.

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.

# Requirement

The SIMATIC Logon Service V1.3 SP1 or higher is installed.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.

# Requirement

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.
