# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.5 Monitoring communication between F-shutdown groups

Time monitoring is implemented in the F_R_BO or F_R_RF FBs and configured at the ""TIMEOUT"" input parameter of the receive block.

To prevent time monitoring being triggered when no errors are pending, the TIMEOUT monitoring time must be set to a value which is at least equal to the higher of the two maximum cyclic interrupt cycle times of F_S_R or F_S_BO and F_R_R or F_R_BO. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xls.

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

- TCImax1 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the associated send block F_S_BO or F_S_R is called.
- TCImax2 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive block F_R_BO or F_R_R is called.

The values for TCImax1 /TClmax2 can be found in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F function block (xx = Number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the send/receive block).

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.5 Monitoring communication between F-shutdown groups

Time monitoring is implemented in the F_R_BO or F_R_RF FBs and configured at the ""TIMEOUT"" input parameter of the receive block.

To prevent time monitoring being triggered when no errors are pending, the TIMEOUT monitoring time must be set to a value which is at least equal to the higher of the two maximum cyclic interrupt cycle times of F_S_R or F_S_BO and F_R_R or F_R_BO. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xls.

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

- TCImax1 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the associated send block F_S_BO or F_S_R is called.
- TCImax2 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive block F_R_BO or F_R_R is called.

The values for TCImax1 /TClmax2 can be found in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F function block (xx = Number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the send/receive block).

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

To prevent time monitoring being triggered when no errors are pending, the TIMEOUT monitoring time must be set to a value which is at least equal to the higher of the two maximum cyclic interrupt cycle times of F_S_R or F_S_BO and F_R_R or F_R_BO. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xls.

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

- TCImax1 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the associated send block F_S_BO or F_S_R is called.
- TCImax2 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive block F_R_BO or F_R_R is called.

The values for TCImax1 /TClmax2 can be found in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F function block (xx = Number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the send/receive block).

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

To prevent time monitoring being triggered when no errors are pending, the TIMEOUT monitoring time must be set to a value which is at least equal to the higher of the two maximum cyclic interrupt cycle times of F_S_R or F_S_BO and F_R_R or F_R_BO. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xls.

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

- TCImax1 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the associated send block F_S_BO or F_S_R is called.
- TCImax2 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive block F_R_BO or F_R_R is called.

The values for TCImax1 /TClmax2 can be found in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F function block (xx = Number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the send/receive block).

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

The values for TCImax1 /TClmax2 can be found in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F function block (xx = Number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the send/receive block).

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.5 Monitoring communication between F-shutdown groups

Time monitoring is implemented in the F_R_BO or F_R_RF FBs and configured at the ""TIMEOUT"" input parameter of the receive block.

To prevent time monitoring being triggered when no errors are pending, the TIMEOUT monitoring time must be set to a value which is at least equal to the higher of the two maximum cyclic interrupt cycle times of F_S_R or F_S_BO and F_R_R or F_R_BO. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xls.

# Configuration of the TIMEOUT input of the F_RBO and F_R_R F-FBs for data exchange between F-shutdown groups

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

- TCImax1 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the associated send block F_S_BO or F_S_R is called.
- TCImax2 Maximum cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive block F_R_BO or F_R_R is called.

The values for TCImax1 /TClmax2 can be found in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F function block (xx = Number of the cyclic interrupt OB with the send/receive block).
