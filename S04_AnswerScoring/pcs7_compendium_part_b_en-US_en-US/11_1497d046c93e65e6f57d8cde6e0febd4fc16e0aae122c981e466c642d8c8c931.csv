# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# 6.1.3 Cyclic interrupts

# Parameter assignment

Process image partitions do not need to be configured for F-program parts, because F-signal modules in S7 F/FH systems are not accessed using the process image, but rather through F-module drivers. When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

NOTICE

Using the ""Increased password security"" functionality: Projects in which the ""Increased password security"" option is activated may only continue to be used in STEP 7 V5.5 SP4 or higher, because this functionality is not backwards compatible!

Note

At least protection level 1 and ""Can be bypassed by password"" must be configured. In addition, the fail-safe program is assigned a password that is created the first time the safety-related software or hardware is used. This password must not be the same as the CPU password.

# 6.1.2 Access protection with SFC 109

There is an additional mode for SFC 109 as of firmware V6.0 of the H-CPU. With MODE = 12, protection level 3 can be set without password authorization.

# Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=0

Setting the protection level: Any applicable block that is present on password authorization is lifted through this call.

# Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=1

Setting of protection level 2 with password authorization: This means that you can lift the write protection set with SFC 109 when knowing the valid password. Any applicable block that is present on password authorization is lifted through this call.

Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=12

Setting of protection level 3 without password authorization: This means that you cannot lift the read and write protection set with SFC 109 even when knowing the valid password. If, at the time of the call up of SFC 109 with MODE=12, an authorized connection is present, the calling of SFC 109 for this connection remains without effect.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# 6.1.3 Cyclic interrupts

# Parameter assignment

Process image partitions do not need to be configured for F-program parts, because F-signal modules in S7 F/FH systems are not accessed using the process image, but rather through F-module drivers. When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

The user program is divided to cyclic interrupt OBs according to the requirements:

- OBA
- Very fast applications
- For example connections, such as Quadlog or Modbus
- OBB
- Fast F applications
- For example pressure protection functions
- OBC
- (Slow) F-applications
- For example slow temperature protection functions
- OBD
- Fast standard applications
- For example fast control functions
- OBE
- Slow standard applications
- For example temperature measurements, visualization functions, enable functions

The following rules apply:

- OBA to OBE:
- One of the cyclic interrupt OBs from OB30 to OB38
- Only certain cyclic interrupt OBs are available, depending on the CPU type.
- Texecution: TA &lt; TB &lt; TC &lt; TD &lt; TE
- (Texecution = The execution time of the cyclic interrupt OBs in ms configured in the CPU properties)
- OBpriority: PA &gt; PB &gt; PC &gt; PD &gt; PE
- (OBpriority = The priority of the cyclic interrupt OBs configured in the CPU properties. Possible values are 7 to 18.)
