# Configuring the safety program

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Configuring the safety program

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Configuring the safety program

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.
