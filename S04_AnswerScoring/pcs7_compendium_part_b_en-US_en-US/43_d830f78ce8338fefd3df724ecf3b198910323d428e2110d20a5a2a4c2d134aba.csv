# 7.9.3 Activating safety mode

Following a download of changes, you will need to reactivate safety mode in order to ensure secure execution of the safety program.

# Procedure

1. Select the CPU or its S7 program in the SIMATIC Manager.
2. Select the menu command ""Options > Edit Safety Program"".
3. Click the ""Safety mode"" button.
4. Confirm activation of the safety mode.

# Note

If, when safety mode is deactivated, the safety program detects a safety-related error, it will disable the option to activate safety mode. A corresponding message will appear indicating how you can rectify the problem.

- This documentation will then include the results of the change comparison and its analysis, the log of the relevant function test, and the updated hardware and software documents, together with modified signatures.

While safety mode is deactivated, we highly recommend operating the plant with a high level of supervision by the operating personnel.

# 7.9.3 Activating safety mode

Following a download of changes, you will need to reactivate safety mode in order to ensure secure execution of the safety program.

# Procedure

1. Select the CPU or its S7 program in the SIMATIC Manager.
2. Select the menu command ""Options > Edit Safety Program"".
3. Click the ""Safety mode"" button.
4. Confirm activation of the safety mode.

# Note

If, when safety mode is deactivated, the safety program detects a safety-related error, it will disable the option to activate safety mode. A corresponding message will appear indicating how you can rectify the problem.
