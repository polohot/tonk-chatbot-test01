# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.1 Creating and configuring a Safety Matrix

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block. This prevents a configured ""1"" from being overwritten when the Safety Matrix is transferred to the CFC.
