# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.1 Introduction

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.1 Introduction

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# 6.7.2 2oo3 Voting with F-AI

2-out-of-3 selection uses three sensors and, for example, three F-AI modules. In the example, each sensor is wired to channel 0 of an F-AI module. The individual signals are then evaluated in the user program. SIL 3 can be achieved with a 2-channel configuration.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.1 Introduction

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state.
