- Max. dark test readback time: 10 ms
- Cycle time: 7 ms + 3 ms = 10 ms
- Response time: 9 ms + max. {3, 10} = 9 ms + 10 ms = 19 ms

- Typical response time (when no errors present) = conversion cycle time × filter
- Maximum response time (with channel error) = 2 x conversion cycle time
- Example:
- Interference frequency 50 Hz, 4 active channels
- Maximum response time (with channel error) = 2 x 109 ms = 218 ms
- Maximum response time (when no errors present) = 2 × 109 ms × 1 = 218 ms

The discrepancy time is not contained in TOFDT. It should always be entered at parameter TDIS.
